The code snippet provided assigns the value of `clique` to `cliquess[left + mid + i]`. Given that `i` is 0, this means `cliquess[left + mid]` is set to `clique`.

Here's the updated state:
- `left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n` and `right - left >= 1` (unchanged).
- `clique` is an integer representing the clique number (unchanged).
- `small_element` is `left + 1` (unchanged).
- `big_element` is `right + 1` (unchanged).
- `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2` (unchanged).
- `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2` (unchanged).
- `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `left + 1 + i` for `i` in `0` to `mid - 1` (unchanged).
- `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for `i` in `0` to `mid - 1` (unchanged).
- `i` is 0 (unchanged).
- `arr[left + mid]` is `right + 1` (unchanged).
- `cliquess[left + mid]` is `clique` (updated).

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n` and `right - left >= 1`; `clique` is an integer representing the clique number; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`; `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`; `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `left + 1 + i` for `i` in `0` to `mid - 1`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for `i` in `0` to `mid - 1`; `i` is 0; `arr[left + mid]` is `right + 1`; `cliquess[left + mid]` is `clique`.**
