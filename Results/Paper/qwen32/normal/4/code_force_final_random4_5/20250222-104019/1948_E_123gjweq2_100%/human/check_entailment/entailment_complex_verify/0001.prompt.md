You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

    print(*cliquess)
    #This is printed: cliques cliques ... cliques (repeated n times, where cliques is the smallest integer greater than or equal to n / k)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where `2 <= n <= 40` and `1 <= k <= 2n`. It prints an array `arr` of length `n` where elements are grouped into `cliques` (the smallest integer greater than or equal to `n / k`), with each group of elements set to a unique integer value starting from 1. It also prints the number of cliques and an array `cliquess` of length `n` where each element is set to the number of cliques.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: left and right are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, and clique is an integer representing the clique number.

    small_element = left + 1

#Overall this is what the function does:The function modifies the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays by filling a segment from index `left` to `right` with specific values. The first half of this segment is filled with increasing values starting from `left + 1`, and the second half with decreasing values starting from `right + 1`. Additionally, it sets the `clique` number for each position in the segment in the `cliquess` array.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program to see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Key Points of the Problem
1. **Graph Construction**:
   - We have `n` vertices, numbered from 1 to `n`.
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to `n` to these vertices.
   - We add an edge between vertices `i` and `j` if `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.
   
2. **Objective**:
   - Partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.
   - Each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.
   - Output the assignment of integers, the number of cliques, and the partition.

### Analysis of the Provided Code

#### Function `func_1(n, k)`
- **Objective**: This function is supposed to compute the assignment of integers to vertices, the number of cliques, and the partition.
- **Implementation**:
  - `cliques = ceil(n / k)`: This calculates the number of cliques as the ceiling of `n / k`. This is a reasonable heuristic but not necessarily optimal.
  - `arr = [0] * n` and `cliquess = [0] * n`: These arrays are supposed to store the assignment of integers and the clique assignments, respectively.
  - The loop `for i in range(cliques)` calls `make_array` to assign values to the vertices and assign them to a clique.
  - The function prints the arrays `arr`, `cliques`, and `cliquess`.

#### Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`
- **Objective**: This function assigns integer values to the vertices in the range `[left, right]` and assigns them to the `clique`.
- **Implementation**:
  - `small_element` and `big_element` are initialized to `left + 1` and `right + 1`, respectively.
  - The code calculates `mid` and `not_mid` to distribute values symmetrically.
  - The values are assigned to `arr` and the corresponding clique numbers are assigned to `cliquess`.

### Issues in the Code
1. **Global Variables**:
   - The arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are used globally within `make_array`. This could lead to issues if the function is called multiple times (e.g., in different test cases) because the same global variables are modified.
   
2. **Correctness of Clique Assignment**:
   - The logic for assigning integers and cliques seems correct in terms of distributing values symmetrically, but it does not guarantee that the resulting graph will be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
   - The calculation of `cliques = ceil(n / k)` is a heuristic, and it does not necessarily yield the optimal number of cliques.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle edge cases explicitly. For example, if `n` is very small or `k` is very large, the behavior might not be as expected.
   
4. **Output Format**:
   - The code prints the required output, but the correctness of the output depends on the correctness of the clique assignment and the integer assignment.

### Conclusion
While the code attempts to solve the problem, it does not guarantee the optimal solution for the minimum number of cliques. The use of global variables and the heuristic approach for determining the number of cliques are potential issues.

Correctness: **False**
