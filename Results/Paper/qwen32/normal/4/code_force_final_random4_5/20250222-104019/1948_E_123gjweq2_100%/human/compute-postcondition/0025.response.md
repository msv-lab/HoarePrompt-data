Functionality: **The function modifies the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays by filling a segment from index `left` to `right` with specific values. The first half of this segment is filled with increasing values starting from `left + 1`, and the second half with decreasing values starting from `right + 1`. Additionally, it sets the `clique` number for each position in the segment in the `cliquess` array.**
