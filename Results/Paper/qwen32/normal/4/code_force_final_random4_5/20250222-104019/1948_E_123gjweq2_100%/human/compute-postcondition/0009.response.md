The code snippet assigns the value of `clique` to `cliquess[left + i]`. Since `i` is already equal to `mid`, this means `cliquess[left + mid]` is being set to `clique`. The other variables remain unchanged by this assignment.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n and right - left >= 1, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `left + 1 + (right - left + 1) // 2`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`, `i` is `mid`.**
