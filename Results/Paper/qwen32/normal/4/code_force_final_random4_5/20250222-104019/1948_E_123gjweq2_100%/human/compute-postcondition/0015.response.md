The code snippet assigns the value of `big_element - i` to `arr[left + mid + i]`. Given the initial state, `big_element` is `right + 1` and `i` is 0. Therefore, `arr[left + mid + 0]` is assigned the value `right + 1 - 0`, which simplifies to `right + 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `0 <= left < right < n` and `right - left >= 1` still holds. The values of `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` remain the same. The array `cliquess[left + i]` for `i` in `0` to `mid - 1` remains `clique`. The value of `i` remains 0.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n` and `right - left >= 1`, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `left + 1 + i` for `i` in `0` to `mid - 1`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for `i` in `0` to `mid - 1`, `i` is 0, `arr[left + mid]` is `right + 1`.**
