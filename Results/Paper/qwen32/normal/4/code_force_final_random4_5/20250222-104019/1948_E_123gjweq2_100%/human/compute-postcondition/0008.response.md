The code snippet updates the value of `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` by setting it to `small_element + i`. Given the initial state, we can substitute the values to determine the new state.

- `small_element` is `left + 1`
- `i` is `mid`
- `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`

So, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` becomes `arr[left + mid - mid - 1]` which simplifies to `arr[left - 1]`.

The new value assigned to `arr[left - 1]` is `small_element + i`, which is `(left + 1) + mid`.

Therefore, the updated array element `arr[left - 1]` is `left + 1 + (right - left + 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n and right - left >= 1, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `left + 1 + (right - left + 1) // 2`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`, `i` is `mid`**.
