The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the range it iterates over is `not_mid`. To ensure the loop can execute, `not_mid` must be greater than 0. Given the state provided, `not_mid` is calculated as `(right - left + 1) // 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `(right - left + 1) // 2` must be greater than 0, which implies `right - left + 1` must be at least 2, or equivalently, `right - left >= 1`. This condition is already given in the problem statement, so no adjustment is needed for `right` and `left`.

However, to ensure the loop starts correctly, `i` should be initialized to 0 before the loop begins.

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n` and `right - left >= 1`, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `left + 1 + i` for `i` in `0` to `mid - 1`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for `i` in `0` to `mid - 1`, `i` is 0**
