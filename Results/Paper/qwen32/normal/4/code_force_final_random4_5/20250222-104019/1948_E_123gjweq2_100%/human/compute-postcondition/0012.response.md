The given code snippet assigns the value of `clique` to `cliquess[left + i]`. However, since the problem statement already mentions that `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`, executing this line does not change the value of `cliquess[left + i]`.

Thus, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the only variable `i` being explicitly mentioned as `mid - 1`.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n` and `right - left >= 1`, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `left + mid`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`, `i` is `mid - 1`**.
