Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Global Variables**: The `arr` and `cliquess` variables are used in the `make_array` function but are not defined within that function or passed as parameters. This will result in a `NameError` because they are not recognized in the local scope of `make_array`.

2. **Incomplete Assignment**: The `arr` and `cliquess` arrays are initialized with zeros, but the `make_array` function does not update these global variables correctly. The `arr` and `cliquess` variables inside `make_array` are local to that function and do not affect the global variables.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Clique Assignment**: The logic to assign vertices to cliques and to assign values to vertices does not ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. The current implementation does not guarantee that every pair of vertices within a clique will have an edge between them based on the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| â‰¤ k`.

4. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases where `k` is very small or very large, which could affect the number of cliques and the assignment of values to vertices.

To fix these issues, the code needs to properly initialize and update the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays, ensure that the condition for edge creation is correctly applied, and verify that the graph is partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

Here is a corrected version of the code that addresses these issues:

```python
from math import ceil

def func_1(n, k):
    arr = list(range(1, n + 1))
    cliques = [1] * n

    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(i):
            if abs(i - j) + abs(arr[i] - arr[j]) > k:
                cliques[i] = cliques[j] + 1
                break

    max_clique = max(cliques)
    print(*arr)
    print(max_clique)
    print(*cliques)

# Example usage:
# func_1(2, 3)
# func_1(5, 4)
# func_1(8, 16)

# Reading input and processing test cases:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    func_1(n, k)
```

This corrected version initializes `arr` with distinct integers from 1 to `n` and assigns each vertex to a clique based on the condition provided. It ensures that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
