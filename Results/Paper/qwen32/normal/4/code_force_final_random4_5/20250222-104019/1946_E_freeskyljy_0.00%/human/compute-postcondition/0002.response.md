The code snippet provided reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers, which are then assigned to the variable `R`. This operation does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. The variables `t`, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}`, `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}`, and `L` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2 * 10^5, `M1` is an integer such that 1 <= `M1` <= `N`, `M2` is an integer such that 1 <= `M2` <= `N`; `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `N`; `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= `s_i` <= `N`. The sum of all `N` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `R` is a list of integers read from the input.**
