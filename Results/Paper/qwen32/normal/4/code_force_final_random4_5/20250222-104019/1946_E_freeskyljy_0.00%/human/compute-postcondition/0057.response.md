The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `N` and `i` is incremented by 1. This means that as long as `i` is incremented and remains less than `N`, the loop can execute again.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to a value that is still less than `N` after the increment. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to `i + 1` such that `i + 1 < N`.

No other states need to be adjusted as per the requirement to only adjust the states of objects in the loop head.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}`, `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged; `nums_left` is -3; `M2` is greater than 1; `i` is incremented by 1 such that `i + 1 < N`**
