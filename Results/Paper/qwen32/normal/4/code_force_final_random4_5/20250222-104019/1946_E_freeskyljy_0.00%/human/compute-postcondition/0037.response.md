To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop and its effects step by step.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2 * 10^5.
- `M1` is an integer such that 1 <= `M1` <= `N`.
- `M2` is an integer such that 1 <= `M2` <= `N`.
- `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `N`.
- `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= `s_i` <= `N`.
- `L` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `R` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `ans` is assigned the value of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.
- `cur` is `M1 - 2` (if `M1 > 1`).
- `nums_left` is `N - 2`.
- `i` is `N - 1`.

### Loop Execution:
The loop decrements `i` from `N - 1` down to `2`. During each iteration:
- If `i` equals `L[cur]`, then `cur` is decremented by 1.
- Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD`.
- `nums_left` is decremented by 1.

### Final State Analysis:
The loop will execute `N - 2` times, decrementing `i` from `N - 1` to `2`. The value of `cur` will decrement each time `i` matches an element in `L` starting from `L[cur]` down to `L[0]` if all `L` elements are encountered. `nums_left` will decrement by 1 in each iteration, starting from `N - 2` and ending at `1`.

### Final Values:
- `i` will be `1` after all iterations.
- `nums_left` will be `1` after all iterations.
- `cur` will be `-1` if all elements of `L` are encountered, otherwise it will be the index of the first `L` element not encountered.
- `ans` will be the product of `ans` and all `nums_left` values from `N - 2` down to `2` (excluding those where `i` matched an element in `L`), modulo `MOD`.

### Output State:
After all iterations, the state of the variables involved in the loop will be:
- `i` will be `1`.
- `nums_left` will be `1`.
- `cur` will be `-1` if all `L` elements are encountered, otherwise it will be the index of the first `L` element not encountered.
- `ans` will be the final computed value.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`i` is 1; `nums_left` is 1; `cur` is -1 (if all `L` elements are encountered, otherwise it is the index of the first `L` element not encountered); `ans` is the final computed value.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `i` will be `1`, `nums_left` will be `1`, `cur` will be `-1` if all elements in `L` have been processed, and `ans` will hold the final result computed through the loop iterations.
