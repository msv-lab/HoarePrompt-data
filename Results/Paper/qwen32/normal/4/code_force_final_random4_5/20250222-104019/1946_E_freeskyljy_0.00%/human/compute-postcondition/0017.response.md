The `while` loop condition is `i > 1`. To ensure that the loop can execute at least once, the variable `i` must be greater than 1 at the point right before the loop starts.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `N - 1`
- `N` is an integer such that `1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5`

For the loop to execute, `i` must satisfy `i > 1`. Since `i` is initialized to `N - 1`, the condition `i > 1` translates to `N - 1 > 1`, or equivalently, `N > 2`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `N`, which must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; For each test case, `N` is an integer such that `2 < N <= 2 * 10^5`, `M1` is an integer such that 1 <= `M1` <= `N`, `M2` is an integer such that 1 <= `M2` <= `N`; `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `N`; `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= `s_i` <= `N`. The sum of all `N` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `R` is a list of integers read from the input. Additionally, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is `N`. At least one of the following conditions is true: `M1` is 1, `M2` is 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`. `ans` is assigned the value of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. `M1` is greater than 1 and `cur` is `M1 - 2`. `nums_left` is `N - 2`. `i` is `N - 1`**
