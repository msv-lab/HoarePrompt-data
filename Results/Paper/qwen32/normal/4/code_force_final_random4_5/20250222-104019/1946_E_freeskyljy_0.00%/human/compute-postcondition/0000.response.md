The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `N`, `M1`, and `M2`. The initial state specifies that `N` corresponds to `n`, `M1` corresponds to `m_1`, and `M2` corresponds to `m_2` for each test case. The values of `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are updated based on the input, while the other variables `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}` and `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}` remain unchanged and are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2 * 10^5, `M1` is an integer such that 1 <= `M1` <= `N`, `M2` is an integer such that 1 <= `M2` <= `N`; `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `N`; `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= `s_i` <= `N`. The sum of all `N` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
