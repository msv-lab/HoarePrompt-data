Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}`, `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged. If `M2` is greater than 1, then `nums_left` is `R[0] - N`, `cur` is `M2 + 1`, `i` is `N`, and `ans` is the result of the product of all `nums_left` values modulo `MOD` after the loop completes. Otherwise, `nums_left` remains -1.**
