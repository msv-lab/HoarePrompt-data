To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables and under what conditions it terminates.

### Key Variables and Their Transformations:
- **`i`**: Starts at `R[0] + 1` and increments by 1 each iteration.
- **`nums_left`**: Starts at -1 and decrements by 1 each iteration.
- **`cur`**: Starts at 1 and increments by 1 whenever `i` matches an element in `R`.
- **`ans`**: Multiplied by `nums_left` and taken modulo `MOD` whenever `i` does not match an element in `R`.

### Loop Termination:
The loop terminates when `i` is no longer less than `N`.

### Final State Analysis:
1. **`i`**: After the loop, `i` will be equal to `N`.
2. **`nums_left`**: Since `nums_left` starts at -1 and decrements by 1 each iteration, after `N - (R[0] + 1)` iterations, `nums_left` will be `-1 - (N - (R[0] + 1)) = R[0] - N`.
3. **`cur`**: `cur` will be incremented by 1 each time `i` matches an element in `R`. Since `cur` starts at 1 and `R` has `M2` elements, `cur` will be `M2 + 1` at the end of the loop (assuming all elements in `R` are encountered).
4. **`ans`**: `ans` is multiplied by `nums_left` and taken modulo `MOD` each time `i` does not match an element in `R`. This means `ans` will be updated `(N - (R[0] + 1) - M2 + 1)` times, which simplifies to `N - R[0] - M2`.

### Final Output State:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged.
- **`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}`, `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}`, `L`, and `R`**: Remain unchanged.
- **`nums_left`**: `R[0] - N`.
- **`cur`**: `M2 + 1`.
- **`i`**: `N`.
- **`ans`**: The value of `ans` after all the multiplications and modulo operations.

Since `nums_left` is `R[0] - N` and it is multiplied by `ans` in each iteration where `i` does not match an element in `R`, the final state of `ans` is determined by the product of all such `nums_left` values modulo `MOD`.

### Final Output State in the Required Format:
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}`, `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged; `nums_left` is `R[0] - N`; `M2` is greater than 1; `cur` is `M2 + 1`; `i` is `N`; `ans` is the result of the product of all `nums_left` values modulo `MOD` after the loop completes.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `i` will be equal to `N`, `nums_left` will be `R[0] - N`, `cur` will be `M2 + 1`, and `ans` will be the result of multiplying `nums_left` for each iteration where `i` did not match an element in `R`, all taken modulo `MOD`.
