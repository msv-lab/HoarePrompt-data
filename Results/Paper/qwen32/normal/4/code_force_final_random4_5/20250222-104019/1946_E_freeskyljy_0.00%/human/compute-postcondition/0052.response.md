The code snippet `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. Given that `cur` is either 1 or 2, after the increment, `cur` will be either 2 or 3, respectively.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}`, `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged; `nums_left` is -2; `M2` is greater than 1; `cur` is either 2 or 3; `i` is less than `N`**.
