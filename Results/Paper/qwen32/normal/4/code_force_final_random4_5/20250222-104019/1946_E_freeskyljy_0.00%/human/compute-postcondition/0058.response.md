The code snippet `cur += 1` increments the value of the variable `cur` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}`, `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged; `nums_left` is -3; `M2` is greater than 1; `i` is incremented by 1 such that `i + 1 < N`; `cur` is incremented by 1.**
