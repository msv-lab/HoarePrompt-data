Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}`, `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged; `nums_left` is -2; `M2` is greater than 1; `i` is less than `N`. If `i` equals `R[cur]`, then `cur` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `cur` is either 1 or 2 and `ans` is updated to `(ans * -2) % MOD`.**
