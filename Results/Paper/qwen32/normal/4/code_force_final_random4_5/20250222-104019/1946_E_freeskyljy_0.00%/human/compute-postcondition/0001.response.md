The code snippet `L = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual string components, converts each of these components to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list `L`.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}`, and `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}` are all defined and have specific values or constraints. The code does not affect these variables directly. However, it introduces a new variable `L` which is a list of integers read from the input.

Since the input is not specified, we can only describe `L` in terms of what it will contain after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2 * 10^5, `M1` is an integer such that 1 <= `M1` <= `N`, `M2` is an integer such that 1 <= `M2` <= `N`; `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `N`; `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= `s_i` <= `N`. The sum of all `N` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `L` is a list of integers read from the input.**
