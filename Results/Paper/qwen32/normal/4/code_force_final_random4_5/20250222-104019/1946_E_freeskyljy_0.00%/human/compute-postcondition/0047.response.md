The code provided is `ans = ans * nums_left % MOD`. Given the initial state, `nums_left` is -1, so the calculation becomes `ans = ans * (-1) % MOD`. This means `ans` will be updated to its current value multiplied by -1 and then taken modulo `MOD`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}`, `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged; `nums_left` is -1; `M2` is greater than 1; `cur` is 1; `i` is `R[0] + 1` and `R[0]` must be less than `N - 1`; `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`; `ans` is `ans * (-1) % MOD`.**
