Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}`, `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged; `nums_left` is -1; `M2` is greater than 1; `cur` is either 1 or 2; `i` is either `R[0] + 1` or `R[cur]` and `R[0]` is less than `N - 1`. If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, then `cur` is 2. If `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, then `cur` is 1 and `ans` is `ans * (-1) % MOD`.**
