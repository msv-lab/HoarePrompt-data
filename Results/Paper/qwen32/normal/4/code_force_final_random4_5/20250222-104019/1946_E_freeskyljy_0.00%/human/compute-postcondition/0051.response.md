To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head condition, which is `i < N`. The other variables mentioned (`t`, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}`, `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}`, `L`, `R`, `nums_left`, `cur`, and `ans`) are not part of the loop condition and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to continue.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}`, `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged.
- `nums_left` is -2.
- `M2` is greater than 1.
- `cur` is either 1 or 2.
- `i` is either `R[0] + 2` or `R[cur] + 1`. If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, then `cur` is 2. If `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, then `cur` is 1 and `ans` is `ans * (-1) % MOD`.

The loop condition `i < N` must be satisfied for the loop to execute again. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `N`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either `R[0] + 2` or `R[cur] + 1`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be less than `N`. Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we need to ensure that whatever the value of `i` is, it should be less than `N`.

Thus, we need to adjust `i` to be a value less than `N`. Since `i` is either `R[0] + 2` or `R[cur] + 1`, we need to ensure that both `R[0] + 2 < N` and `R[cur] + 1 < N`.

However, since we are only adjusting the state for the loop to execute one more time, we can simply ensure that `i` is less than `N` by adjusting `i` directly if necessary. Given that `i` is currently either `R[0] + 2` or `R[cur] + 1`, we can assume that `R[0]` and `R[cur]` are such that `R[0] + 2 < N` and `R[cur] + 1 < N` are already true, or we can adjust `i` directly to be less than `N`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is less than `N`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}`, `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged; `nums_left` is -2; `M2` is greater than 1; `cur` is either 1 or 2; `i` is less than `N`**
