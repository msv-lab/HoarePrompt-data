To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition `i < N`. The variables `i` and `N` are the only ones that appear in the loop head, so we can only adjust these.

Given:
- `i` is initialized to `R[0] + 1`.
- `N` remains unchanged and is a positive integer.

For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `N`. Since `i` is initialized to `R[0] + 1`, we need to ensure that `R[0] + 1 < N`.

If `R[0] + 1` is not less than `N`, we need to adjust either `R[0]` or `N` to make this condition true. However, since `N` remains unchanged and `R[0]` is part of the initial state, we can adjust `R[0]` to be less than `N - 1` to ensure `i < N`.

Since `i` is `R[0] + 1`, we can set `R[0]` to be any value such that `R[0] + 1 < N`. The simplest adjustment is to set `R[0]` to `N - 2` (assuming `N` is at least 2, which is reasonable given `M2` is greater than 1 and other constraints).

However, since the problem does not specify the exact value of `N`, we can simply state that `R[0]` should be adjusted to ensure `R[0] + 1 < N`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}`, `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged; `nums_left` is -1; `M2` is greater than 1; `cur` is 1; `i` is `R[0] + 1` and `R[0]` must be less than `N - 1`**
