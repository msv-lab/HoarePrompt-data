To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(func_10()):`, which means the loop will continue to execute as long as `func_10()` returns a positive integer.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.
- A positive integer has been returned and printed by `func_15()`.

The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable indicating that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. The loop's continuation depends on the return value of `func_10()`.

Since `func_10()` determines whether the loop continues, for the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must return a positive integer.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `func_10()` has been called again and has returned a positive integer, allowing the loop to proceed.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, and `func_10()` returns a positive integer**.
