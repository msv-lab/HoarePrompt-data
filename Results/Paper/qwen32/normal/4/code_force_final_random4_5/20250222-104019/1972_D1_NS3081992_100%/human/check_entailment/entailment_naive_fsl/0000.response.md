Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The main function responsible for solving the problem is `func_15()`, which calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions. However, the logic in `func_15()` is incorrect.

Let's break down the problem and the code:

### Problem Breakdown:
The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Code Analysis:
The function `func_15()` attempts to solve this problem using the following logic:
```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Loop Condition**: The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` is not a correct way to iterate over all possible values of \(b\). The loop should iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The calculation `(n + i) // (i * i)` does not correctly determine the number of valid pairs (a, b) for each \(b\). The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not properly handled.
3. **Subtraction of 1**: The final result is `ans - 1`, which is not justified and could lead to incorrect results.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\) and for each \(b\), determine the valid values of \(a\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This involves checking the condition for each pair (a, b) and counting the valid pairs.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the test case:
```
1
10 8
```
The expected output is 14, but the provided code will not produce this result due to the incorrect logic in `func_15()`.

### Conclusion:
Since the provided code does not correctly handle the problem for all potential cases, the correctness is **False**.
