Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, and `func_10()` returns a positive integer; a positive integer equal to `func_15()` has been returned and printed.**

Natural language: The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and `func_10()` still returns a positive integer. The function `func_15()` is executed, and its return value, which is a positive integer, is printed to the standard output.
