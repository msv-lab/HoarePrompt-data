### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided solution to verify the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
for some integer \(k\). This implies:
\[ a = (k-1) \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]

Let's denote \(g = \gcd(a, b)\), then \(a = g \cdot x\) and \(b = g \cdot y\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). The condition becomes:
\[ g \cdot x + g \cdot y = k \cdot g \cdot x \cdot y \]
\[ x + y = k \cdot x \cdot y \]
\[ k = \frac{x + y}{x \cdot y} \]

For \(k\) to be an integer, \(x + y\) must be divisible by \(x \cdot y\). This happens when \(x = 1\) or \(y = 1\), or when \(x\) and \(y\) are small integers that satisfy the equation.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program includes several functions, but only `func_15` and `func_16` are relevant to solving the problem. `func_16` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15` for each test case. `func_15` seems to implement the logic to count the valid pairs.

Here's a breakdown of `func_15`:
```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

- It reads \(n\) and \(m\).
- It initializes `ans` to 0.
- It iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(\sqrt{n + i}\) (approximately).
- For each \(i\), it adds \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i \cdot i} \right\rfloor\) to `ans`.
- Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

This logic is not directly derived from the problem's requirement. The provided code does not correctly account for the condition \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check the condition directly. Here is a more accurate approach:

1. For each \(b\) from 1 to \(m\):
2. For each \(a\) from 1 to \(n\):
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

This can be optimized using mathematical properties, but the provided code does not follow this logic.

#### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic to count the pairs is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
