Let's analyze the provided code to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Code Analysis:
The code provided includes multiple utility functions for input handling and a function `func_15` which seems to be doing the core computation for each test case. The function `func_16` orchestrates the input reading and output writing for multiple test cases.

#### Function `func_15`:
- This function takes two integers `n` and `m` as input.
- It initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
- It then enters a loop where `i` iterates from 1 to `m` as long as \(i \cdot i \le n + i\).
- For each `i`, it increments `ans` by \((n + i) // (i \cdot i)\).
- Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

#### Mathematical Interpretation:
The loop in `func_15` appears to be calculating the number of valid pairs (a, b) by leveraging the condition that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the logic used in the loop does not directly match the problem's requirement.

The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rephrased as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
for some integer \(k\).

This implies:
\[ a = (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1) \cdot b \]

The loop in `func_15` does not seem to be iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b` to check this condition. Instead, it uses a mathematical formula that does not directly correspond to the problem's constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid pairs (a, b) according to the problem's requirements. The function `func_15` seems to be using a different approach that does not match the problem statement.

**Correctness: False**
