Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a string provided by user input with length at least 1; `b` is a string provided by user input; `q` is `q + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`. If `vt` was 0, then `vt` is now 1, `kq1` is concatenated with `str(x)` if `a[i] > b[i]` otherwise with `str(y)`, and `kq2` is concatenated with `str(y)` if `a[i] > b[i]` otherwise with `str(x)`. If `vt` was not 0, then `kq1` is concatenated with `str(y)` and `kq2` is concatenated with `str(x)`.**
