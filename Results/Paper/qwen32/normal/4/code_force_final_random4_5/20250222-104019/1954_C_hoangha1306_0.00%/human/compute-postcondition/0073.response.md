Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a non-empty string provided by the user input; `b` is the new string provided by the user input; `kq1` is ''; `kq2` is ''; `vt` is 0; `q` is the value of `q` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `i` is 0; `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**

In simple terms: The variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `kq1`, `kq2`, `vt`, `q`, and `i` remain unchanged. Two new variables `x` and `y` are introduced, where `x` is the smaller of the integer values of the characters at index `i` of strings `a` and `b`, and `y` is the larger of those integer values.
