The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement has no effect on the variables or the program's state. Therefore, none of the variables will be changed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a` is a string with at least 1 character, `b` is the string provided by the next user input, `kq1` is the character at index `i` of `a`, `kq2` is the character at index `i` of `a`, `vt` is 0, and the character at index `i` in `a` is equal to the character at index `i` in `b`.**
