The code snippet `kq2 = kq2 + str(y)` appends the string representation of `y` to the string `kq2`. Given that `kq2` was initially an empty string, it will now hold the string representation of `y`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a non-empty string provided by the user input; `b` is the new string provided by the user input; `kq1` is the string representation of `x`; `kq2` is the string representation of `y`; `vt` is 1; `q` is the value of `q` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `i` is 0; `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. Additionally, the integer value of `a[i]` is greater than the integer value of `b[i]`.**
