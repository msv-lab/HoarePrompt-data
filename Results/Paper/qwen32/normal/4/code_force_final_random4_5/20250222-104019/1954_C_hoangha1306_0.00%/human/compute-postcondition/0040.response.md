The code snippet `kq2 = kq2 + str(x)` concatenates the string representation of `x` to the existing value of `kq2`. Other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `kq1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a` is a string with at least 1 character, `b` is the string provided by the next user input, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `kq1` is `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is `kq2` concatenated with the string representation of `x`.**
