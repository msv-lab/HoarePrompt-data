The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two strings `x` and `y` of equal length, where each character is a digit from 1 to 9. For each test case, it constructs two new strings: one where each digit is the maximum of the corresponding digits from `x` and `y` (with the first differing digit being the larger of the two), and another where each digit is the minimum of the corresponding digits from `x` and `y` (with the first differing digit being the smaller of the two). It then prints these two strings for each test case.
