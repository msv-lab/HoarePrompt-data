Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a non-empty string provided by the user input; `b` is the new string provided by the user input; `kq1` is ''; `kq2` is ''; `vt` is 0; `q` is the value of `q` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `i` is 0; `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. Additionally, `vt` is 0.**
