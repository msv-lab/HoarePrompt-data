The code snippet provided appends the string representation of `y` to the variable `kq1`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `kq1` and retains the values of the other variables as they were initially provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` and `b` are non-empty strings provided by the user input; `q` is the value of `q` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `i` is 2; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`; `kq1` is the value of `kq1` from the previous state concatenated with the string representation of `y`.**
