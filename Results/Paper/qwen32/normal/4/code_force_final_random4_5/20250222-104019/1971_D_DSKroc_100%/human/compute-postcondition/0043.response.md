Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `s` is a string input by the user that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is `i + 1`, `q` is incremented by 1, and `count` is incremented by 1 if the integer value of `s[i]` is not equal to the integer value of `s[i + 1]`. If the integer value of `s[i]` is less than the integer value of `s[i + 1]`, `flag` is set to 1.**
