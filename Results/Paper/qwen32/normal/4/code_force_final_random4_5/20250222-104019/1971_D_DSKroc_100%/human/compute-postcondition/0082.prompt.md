Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    s = input()
    count = 0
    flag = 0
    for i in range(len(s) - 1):
        if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
            count += 1
        if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
            flag = 1
    if flag == 0:
        print(count + 1)
    else:
        print(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `s` is the string input by the user, `count` is the number of positions where two consecutive characters in `s` are different, and `flag` is either 0 (indicating there is no position where a character is less than the next character) or 1 (indicating there is at least one position where a character is less than the next character).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `s` is the new string input by the user, `count` is the number of times adjacent characters in `s` have different integer values, `flag` is either 0 (indicating there is no pair of adjacent characters where the first character's integer value is less than the second character's integer value) or 1 (indicating there is at least one pair of adjacent characters where the first character's integer value is less than the second character's integer value), and `q` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `s` is the new string input by the user, `count` is the number of times consecutive characters in `s` have different integer values, `flag` is 0 if there is no pair of consecutive characters where the integer value of the first character is less than the integer value of the second character, and `flag` is 1 if there is at least one such pair, and `q` is `q + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
