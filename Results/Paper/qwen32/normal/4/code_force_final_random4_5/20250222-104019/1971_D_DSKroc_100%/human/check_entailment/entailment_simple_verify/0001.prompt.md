You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):

        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives a string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'.

    #State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `q` has reached the value of `t`, and for each of the `t` iterations, the program has processed a string `s` by calculating `count` (the number of positions where two consecutive characters in `s` are different) and `flag` (indicating whether there is at least one position where a character is less than the next character). The program has printed `count + 1` if `flag` is 0, otherwise it has printed `count`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic and see if it correctly computes the minimum number of pieces required to rearrange a given binary string into a sorted binary string.

The key observation here is that a binary string can be rearranged into a sorted binary string if and only if all '0's can be moved to the left of all '1's. To achieve this, we need to identify transitions from '1' to '0' and vice versa in the string. Each such transition indicates a potential cut point where the string needs to be divided into separate pieces.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the binary string `s`.
3. It initializes a counter `count` to count the number of transitions between '0' and '1'.
4. It also initializes a flag `flag` to check if there is a transition from '0' to '1'.
5. It then iterates through the string and increments `count` every time it finds a transition (i.e., when `s[i] != s[i + 1]`).
6. If a transition from '0' to '1' is found (i.e., `int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1])`), it sets `flag` to 1.
7. After the loop, if `flag` is still 0 (meaning there were no transitions from '0' to '1'), it prints `count + 1` (which handles the edge case where the string is all '0's or all '1's).
8. Otherwise, it prints `count`.

The logic seems correct, but let's verify the edge cases and transitions:

- If the string is entirely '0's or '1's, `count` will be 0, and since there are no transitions from '0' to '1', `flag` will remain 0. The program will correctly print `count + 1 = 1`.
- If there are transitions, the program will correctly count the number of transitions and print `count`.

Let's test the program with the provided examples:

1. For `11010`, the transitions are at positions 1 and 3, so `count` will be 2. Since there is a transition from '0' to '1', `flag` will be 1, and the program will print `count = 2 + 1 = 3`.
2. For `00000000`, there are no transitions, so `count` will be 0, and since there are no transitions from '0' to '1', `flag` will be 0. The program will print `count + 1 = 1`.
3. For `1`, there are no transitions, so `count` will be 0, and since there are no transitions from '0' to '1', `flag` will be 0. The program will print `count + 1 = 1`.
4. For `10`, the transition is at position 0, so `count` will be 1. Since there is a transition from '1' to '0', `flag` will be 0, but the program will correctly print `count = 1`.
5. For `0001111`, there is one transition, so `count` will be 1. Since there is a transition from '0' to '1', `flag` will be 1, and the program will print `count = 1`.
6. For `0110`, the transitions are at positions 0 and 2, so `count` will be 2. Since there is a transition from '0' to '1', `flag` will be 1, and the program will print `count = 2`.

Based on this analysis, the program seems to handle all the cases correctly.

Reasoning: The program correctly counts the number of transitions between '0' and '1' and handles the edge cases where the string is entirely '0's or '1's. It correctly determines the minimum number of pieces required to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Correctness: **True**
