Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `s` is a string with at least one character, `i` is `i + 2`, `q` is `q + 1`. If `int(s[i])` is not equal to `int(s[i + 1])`, then `count` is increased by 1. If `int(s[i + 1]) < int(s[i + 2])`, then `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged. If `int(s[i])` is equal to `int(s[i + 1])`, then `count` and `flag` remain unchanged.**
