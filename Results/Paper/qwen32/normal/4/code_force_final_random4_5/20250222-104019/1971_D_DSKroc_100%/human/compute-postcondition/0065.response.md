Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `s` is a string with at least one character, `q` is `q + 1`. If the integer value of the character at index `i` in `s` is less than the integer value of the character at index `i + 1` in `s`, then `flag` is 1 and `count` is 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains 0 and `count` is 1 if the integer value of the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the integer value of the character at index `i + 1` in `s`, otherwise `count` remains 0.**
