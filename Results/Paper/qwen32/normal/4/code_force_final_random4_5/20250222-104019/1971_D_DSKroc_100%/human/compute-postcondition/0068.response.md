Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `s` is a string with at least one character, `i` is `i + 1`, `q` is `q + 1`, `flag` is either 0 or 1, and `count` is increased by 1 if the integer value of the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the integer value of the character at index `i + 1` in `s`. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.**

This postcondition summarizes the behavior of the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts (where the else part does not modify any variables). It captures the conditions and changes to the variables as described in the precondition and the if part.
