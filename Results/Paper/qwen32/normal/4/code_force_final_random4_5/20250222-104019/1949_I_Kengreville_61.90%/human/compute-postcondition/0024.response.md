Postcondition: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length n, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length n, `nodes` includes `i`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of length n, `n` is greater than 0, `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`. If `visited[j]` is `False` and `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2`, then `coef0[j]` is set to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, `coef1[j]` is set to `-coef1[i]`, and the function `dfs(j)` is called. Otherwise, no changes are made to `coef0[j]`, `coef1[j]`, or the function `dfs(j)` is not called.**
