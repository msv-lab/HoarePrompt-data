### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine if it's possible to adjust the radii of the disks such that the sum of the radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency between disks that were initially tangent and ensuring no overlap in areas.

#### Key Points:
1. **DFS Functionality**: The `dfs` function performs a depth-first search to explore all disks that are part of the same connected component where disks are considered connected if they are tangent to each other. The function updates the `visited` list to mark disks as visited, the `nodes` list to store the indices of disks in the connected component, and the `coef0` and `coef1` lists with calculated coefficients.

2. **Condition for `c1`**: The main function `func_1` iterates over all disks and calls `dfs` for disks that haven't been visited yet. It calculates `c0` and `c1` for each connected component. The program checks if `c1` is not zero for any connected component. If `c1` is not zero for at least one component, it prints "YES", indicating that it's possible to adjust the radii as required.

3. **Checking Tangency**: The condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` in the `dfs` function checks if two disks are tangent by comparing the square of the sum of their radii with the square of the distance between their centers.

4. **Output**: The output "YES" implies that there exists at least one configuration of radii that meets the criteria, while "NO" means no such configuration exists.

#### Analysis:
- The logic for checking tangency and performing DFS seems correct.
- The condition `c1 != 0` is used to determine if a valid configuration of radii exists. However, the exact mathematical reasoning behind this condition is not provided in the problem statement. Based on the problem's description and the nature of the solution, `c1` likely represents a necessary condition for the existence of a valid radius configuration.

### Conclusion:
Given the provided code and the problem description, the program appears to implement a correct approach to solve the problem. The DFS correctly identifies connected components of tangent disks, and the condition `c1 != 0` seems to be a valid criterion for determining if the radii can be adjusted as required.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
