The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search starting from a specified disk index `i` to explore all disks that are part of the same connected component based on their positions and radii. It updates the `visited` list to mark these disks as visited, populates the `nodes` list with the indices of disks in the connected component, and modifies the `coef0` and `coef1` lists with calculated coefficients. The function modifies these lists in place and does not return any explicit values.
