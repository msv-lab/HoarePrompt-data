Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, we need to determine what the `print` statement will output.

Here's the breakdown of the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000.
- `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers, each with `n` elements.
- `visited` is a list of `True` values with length `n`.
- `coef0` is a list where each element is `0` or `None` if `visited[i]` was initially `True`.
- `coef1` is a list where each element is `1` or `None` if `visited[i]` was initially `True`.
- `nodes` is an empty list at the end of the loop.
- `i` is set to `n-1`.
- `ok` is a boolean variable set to `True`, indicating that at least one `c1` was not equal to `0` during the execution of the loop.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **YES**
