The code snippet `c1 = 0` sets the variable `c1` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list where each `x[i]` is the first integer from the i-th input; `y` is a list where each `y[i]` is the second integer from the i-th input; `r` is a list where each `r[i]` is the third integer from the i-th input; `visited[2]` is `True`; `coef0[2]` and `coef1[2]` are updated based on DFS logic; `nodes` is a list that includes the node `2`; `i` is 2; `ok` is `True` if `c1` is not equal to `0`, otherwise `False`; `c0` is 0; `c1` is 0.**
