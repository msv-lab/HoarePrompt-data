To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the code snippet on the variables. The code snippet calculates the difference between the `i`-th and `j`-th elements of the list `x` and assigns this difference to the variable `dx`.

Given the initial state, `i` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq i < n\), and `x` is a list of length `n`. The variable `j` is not defined in the initial state, but it must be a valid index for the list `x` (i.e., \(0 \leq j < n\)). The code snippet does not modify `i`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `nodes`, `coef0`, or `coef1`. It only introduces a new variable `dx` which is the difference between `x[i]` and `x[j]`.

Since `j` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot provide a specific value for `dx`. However, we can describe `dx` in terms of `x[i]` and `x[j]`.

Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length n, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length n, `nodes` is a list that includes `i`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of length n, `n` must be greater than 0, `dx` is x[i] - x[j]**.
