Functionality: **The function `dfs` accepts a parameter `i`, which is a non-negative integer representing the index of a disk. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal starting from the disk at index `i`. The function explores connected components of disks based on their positions and radii, updating the `visited` list to mark disks as visited, and the `nodes` list to store the indices of disks in the current connected component. The function also updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists with coefficients during the traversal. There are no explicit return values; the function modifies the input lists in place.**
