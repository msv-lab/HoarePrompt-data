The code snippet `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `arr` to the set `s`. Since `s` is already a set containing `arr[i]` from the initial state, adding `arr[i]` again will not change `s` because sets do not allow duplicate elements. The value of `i` is not changed by this operation, and other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a set containing `arr[i]`; If `n` is 2, `ans` remains 1. If `n` is greater than 2, `ans` is 1 if (n-2) is even, and `ans` is 0 if (n-2) is odd; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `i` must be less than `n`.**
