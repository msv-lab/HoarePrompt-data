To determine the state adjustments required for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop header. The loop header is:

```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the range `(1, n - 1)` is non-empty, meaning `n - 1` must be greater than `1`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than `2`.

Given the current state:
- `t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.
- `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr`, sorted in ascending order.
- `ans` is 1.
- `i` is equal to `n`, indicating the loop has finished executing.
- `n` is not equal to 2 (this seems contradictory to the loop condition, so we will adjust this).

Since the loop header depends on `n`, we need to ensure `n` is greater than `2` for the loop to execute. We can adjust `n` to be greater than `2` and set `i` to an initial value within the range `(1, n - 1)`.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr`, sorted in ascending order, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1**

This ensures that the loop can execute because `i` starts at `1` and `n - 1` is greater than `1`, making the range `(1, n - 1)` non-empty.
