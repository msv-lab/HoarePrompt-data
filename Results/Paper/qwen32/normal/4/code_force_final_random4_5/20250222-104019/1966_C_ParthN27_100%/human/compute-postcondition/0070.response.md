The `break` statement will exit the most internal loop or if statement without affecting the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, `ans`, or `i`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the length of the list `s` and `n` must be greater than 2, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing `0` as its first element followed by all unique elements from `arr` up to the `n`-th element, `ans` is set to 1 if the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is 1 or less, and `i` is 3. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
