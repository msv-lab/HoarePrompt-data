The code snippet `ans = 1` sets the variable `ans` to 1. The values of other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr`, sorted in ascending order; `ans` is 1; `i` is equal to `n`, indicating the loop has finished executing.**
