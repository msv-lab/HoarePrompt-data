The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `arr` to the set `s`. Given that `i` is 4, the element `arr[4]` is added to the set `s`. Initially, `s` contains the element `arr[3]`. After the operation, `s` will contain both `arr[3]` and `arr[4]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than 4, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a set containing the elements `arr[3]` and `arr[4]`, and `i` is 4.**
