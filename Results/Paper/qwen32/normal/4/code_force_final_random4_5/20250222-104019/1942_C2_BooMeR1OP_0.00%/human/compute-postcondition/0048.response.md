The code `ans += 2 * y` modifies the value of `ans` by adding `2 * y` to its current value. Given the initial state, the value of `ans` is `x - 2`. After the code is executed, `ans` becomes `(x - 2) + 2 * y`.

The values of `gaps`, `pairs`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is `x - 2 + 2 * y`, `gaps` is a sorted list of all positive gaps, `pairs` is `gap // 2`, and `y` is less than `pairs`**.
