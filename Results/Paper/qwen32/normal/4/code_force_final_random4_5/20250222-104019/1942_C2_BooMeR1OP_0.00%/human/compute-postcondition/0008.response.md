The code snippet calculates `t2` based on the value of `a[i]`, `n`, and the expression `(a[i] + 2) % n`. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `present`, `ans`, and `t1` remain unchanged. The only variable that is updated is `t2`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `a` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 0 to n-1, `present` is a set containing the same elements as `a`, `ans` is `x - 2`, `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`.**
