The code appends the value of `gap` to the list `gaps`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the new state is that `gaps` now contains the value of `gap`, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`ans` is `x - 2`, `gaps` is a list containing `[gap]`, `x` is greater than 0, `next_elem` is `a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, and `gap` is greater than 0.**
