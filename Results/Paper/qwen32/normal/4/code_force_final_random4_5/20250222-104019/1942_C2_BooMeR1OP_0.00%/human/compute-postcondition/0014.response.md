The code snippet provided calculates the value of `t2` based on the current value of `i` and the elements of the list `a`. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `present`, `i`, and `t1` remain unchanged except for `t2`.

Given:
- `i` is `x`
- `t2` is calculated as `(a[i] + 2) % n`

Since `i` is `x`, we substitute `i` with `x` in the expression for `t2`:
- `t2 = (a[x] + 2) % n`

Therefore, the value of `t2` is `(a[x] + 2) % n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `a` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 0 to n-1, `present` is a set containing the same elements as `a`, `i` is x, `t1` is `(a[x] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x] + 2) % n`.**
