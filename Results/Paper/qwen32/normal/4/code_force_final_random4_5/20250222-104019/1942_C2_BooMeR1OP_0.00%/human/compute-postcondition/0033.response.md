Output State: **`ans` is `x - 2`, `gaps` is a list containing `[gap, gap]` if `gap` is greater than 0, otherwise `gaps` remains `[gap]`, `x` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `next_elem` is `a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)`, `gap` is `a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0) - a[i] - 1`**

Explanation: The code appends the `gap` value to the `gaps` list. If `gap` was initially greater than 0, `gaps` now contains two `gap` values. Otherwise, it still contains one `gap` value. All other variables retain their initial values or expressions.
