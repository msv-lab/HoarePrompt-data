The code snippet `t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n` calculates the value of `t1` based on the value of `a[i]`, `n`, and assigns it to `t1`. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `present`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The only new variable introduced is `t1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9
- `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)
- `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x
- `a` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 0 to n-1
- `present` is a set containing the same elements as `a`
- `ans` is `x - 2`

The value of `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `a` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 0 to n-1, `present` is a set containing the same elements as `a`, `ans` is `x - 2`, `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`**.
