Output State: **`ans` is `x - 2`, `gaps` is a list containing all positive gaps calculated as `a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0) - a[i] - 1` for each `i` in the range `[0, x-1]`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `ans` remains `x - 2`. The `gaps` list contains all the positive differences calculated between each element in the list `a` and the next element (considering the list as circular, so the element after the last one is the first one), plus `n` if it's the last iteration, minus one. If the difference is not positive, it is not added to the list.
