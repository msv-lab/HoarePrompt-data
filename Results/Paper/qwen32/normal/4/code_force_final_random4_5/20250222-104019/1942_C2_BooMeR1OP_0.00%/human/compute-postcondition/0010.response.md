Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `a` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 0 to n-1, `present` is a set containing the same elements as `a`, `ans` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`. The current value of `t1` is not in `present` and the current value of `t2` is in `present`.**

Natural Language: The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, so `ans` is now `x - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
