Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), an integer `x` (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)), and an integer `y` (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x). It also takes a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The function returns the result for each test case based on the given inputs.**
