The code snippet reassigns `t1` with the value `(a[i] + 1) % n`. Given that `i` is initially `x - 1`, `a[i]` is `a[x - 1]`. Therefore, the new value of `t1` is the same as its previous value, which is `(a[x - 1] + 1) % n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `a` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 0 to n-1, `present` is a set containing the same elements as `a`, `i` is x - 1, `t1` is `(a[x - 1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x - 1] + 2) % n`. If `t1` is not in `present` and `t2` is in `present`, `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
