The given code snippet initializes a dictionary `d` with a key-value pair where the key is `1` and the value is `1`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < number of vertices in g, `stack` is `[(1, 1)]`, `visited` is an empty set, `d` is `{1: 1}`.**
