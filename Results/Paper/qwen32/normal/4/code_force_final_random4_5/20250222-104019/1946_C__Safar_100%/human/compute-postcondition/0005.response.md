The code `x, p = stack[-1]` takes the last element of the `stack` list and unpacks it into the variables `x` and `p`. Given that the `stack` is initialized as `[(1, 1)]`, the last element of the `stack` is `(1, 1)`. Therefore, `x` will be assigned the value `1` and `p` will also be assigned the value `1`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < number of vertices in g, `stack` is `[(1, 1)]`, `visited` is an empty set, `d` is `{1: 1}`, `r` is 0, `x` is 1, `p` is 1**.
