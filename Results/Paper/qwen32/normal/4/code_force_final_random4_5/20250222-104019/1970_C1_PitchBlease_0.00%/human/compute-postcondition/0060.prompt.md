You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and target are integers representing nodes in the tree such that 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. tree is a dictionary (or list of lists) where tree[i] contains the neighbors of node i.
def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: `start` and `target` remain unchanged, `tree` remains unchanged, `queue` is empty, `visited` contains all nodes that are reachable from `start`, `current` is the last node processed, and `dist` is the shortest distance from `start` to `target` if `target` is reachable; otherwise, `dist` reflects the distance to the last node processed.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `bfs` accepts two integer parameters `start` and `target`, representing nodes in a tree, and a `tree` which is a dictionary (or list of lists) where `tree[i]` contains the neighbors of node `i`. The function performs a breadth-first search to determine the shortest distance from `start` to `target`. If `start` is equal to `target`, the function returns `0`. If `target` is reachable from `start`, the function returns the shortest distance `dist` from `start` to `target`. If `target` is not reachable, the function returns `-1`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns dist, which is 0

Case_2: The program returns `dist`, which is the next value in the deque after `next_node`

Case_3: The program returns `dist`, which is the shortest distance from `start` to `target` if `target` is reachable, otherwise, it is the distance to the last node processed.

Case_4: The program returns -1


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
