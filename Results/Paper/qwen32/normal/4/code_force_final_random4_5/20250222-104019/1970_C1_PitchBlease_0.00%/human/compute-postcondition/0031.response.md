Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree such that 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n; `tree` is a dictionary where `tree[i]` contains the neighbors of node i and `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor; `queue` is a deque; `visited` contains all nodes that are reachable from `start` including `next_node` and `neighbor` and now also includes `neighbor`; `current` is `next_node`; `neighbor` is the next neighbor in `tree[current]` that has not been processed yet.**

In simpler terms, the `visited` set now includes the `neighbor` node, which was not in it before. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
