Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree such that 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree; `tree` is a dictionary (or list of lists) where `tree[i]` contains the neighbors of node i; `queue` is a deque that is now empty or contains remaining tuples after removing the first one; `visited` is a set containing the `start` node; `current` is equal to `start`; `dist` is 0; `current` is not equal to `target`
Code of the loop:
for neighbor in tree[current]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
        visited.add(neighbor)
        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree such that 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n; `tree` is a dictionary where `tree[i]` contains the neighbors of node i, and `tree[start]` must contain at least one neighbor; `queue` is a deque that may contain the previous elements plus a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` if `neighbor` was not in the `visited` set; `visited` is a set containing the `start` node, `current` node, and possibly other nodes; `current` is equal to `start` or another node in the tree; `dist` is a non-negative integer representing the distance from `start` to `current`; `neighbor` is a neighbor of `current`, and if `neighbor` was not in the `visited` set before this operation, it is now added to the `visited` set and `(neighbor, dist + 1)` is added to the `queue`. If `neighbor` was already in the `visited` set, the `queue` and `visited` sets remain unchanged. `current` is not equal to `target`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree such that 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n; `tree` is a dictionary where `tree[i]` contains the neighbors of node i, and `tree[start]` must contain at least one neighbor; `queue` is a deque that contains the previous elements plus a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` if `neighbor` was not in the `visited` set; `visited` is a set containing the `start` node, `current` node, and possibly other nodes, including `neighbor` if `neighbor` was not in `visited`; `current` is equal to `start` or another node in the tree; `dist` is a non-negative integer representing the distance from `start` to `current`; `neighbor` is the next neighbor of `current` in the list of neighbors of `current` that has not yet been processed; `current` is not equal to `target`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree such that 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n; `tree` is a dictionary where `tree[i]` contains the neighbors of node i, and `tree[start]` must contain at least one neighbor; `queue` is a deque that contains the previous elements plus a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` if `neighbor` was not in the `visited` set; `visited` is a set containing the `start` node, `current` node, and possibly other nodes, including `neighbor` if `neighbor` was just added to `visited`; `current` is equal to `start` or another node in the tree; `dist` is a non-negative integer representing the distance from `start` to `current`; `neighbor` is the next neighbor of `current` in the list of neighbors of `current` that has not yet been processed; `current` is not equal to `target`. If `neighbor` was not in `visited`, `neighbor` is added to `visited` and `(neighbor, dist + 1)` is appended to `queue`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
