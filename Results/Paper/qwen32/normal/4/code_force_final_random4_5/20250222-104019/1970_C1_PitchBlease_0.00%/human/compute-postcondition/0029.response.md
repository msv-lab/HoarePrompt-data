Postcondition: **`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree such that 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n; `tree` is a dictionary where `tree[i]` contains the neighbors of node i and `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor; `queue` is a deque. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, then `queue` contains all previous elements plus `(neighbor, dist + 1)` and `visited` contains all nodes that are reachable from `start` including `next_node` and `neighbor`. If `current` equals `target`, the program returns `dist`, which is the next value in the deque after `next_node`. Otherwise, no return value is specified and the state of `dist` remains as the next value in the deque after `next_node`. If `neighbor` is already in `visited`, then `queue` and `visited` remain unchanged. `current` is `next_node`.**
