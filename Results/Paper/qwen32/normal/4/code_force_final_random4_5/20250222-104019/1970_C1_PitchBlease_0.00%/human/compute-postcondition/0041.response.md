Output State: **The program returns `dist`, which is the shortest distance from `start` to `target` if `target` is reachable, otherwise, it is the distance to the last node processed.**

This means that `dist` will hold the shortest path distance from the starting node to the target node if the target is reachable from the start. If the target is not reachable, `dist` will be the distance to the last node that was processed in the algorithm.
