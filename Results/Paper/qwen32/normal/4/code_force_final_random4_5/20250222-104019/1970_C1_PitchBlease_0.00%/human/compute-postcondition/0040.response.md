Output State: **`start` and `target` remain unchanged, `tree` remains unchanged, `queue` has one less node, `visited` will contain all nodes that are reachable from `start`, `current` is the node that was at the front of `queue`, `dist` is the distance associated with `current` node if it was part of a tuple, otherwise it is the node itself, and `dist` will be the shortest distance from `start` to `target` if `target` is reachable, otherwise, it will be the distance to the last node processed.**

In simpler terms: The `current` variable now holds the node that was at the front of the `queue`, and the `dist` variable holds the distance associated with that node. The `queue` now has one less node. All other variables remain unchanged.
