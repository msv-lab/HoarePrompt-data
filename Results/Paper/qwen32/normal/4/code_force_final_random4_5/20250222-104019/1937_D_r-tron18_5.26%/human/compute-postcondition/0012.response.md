Let's analyze the given code snippet and determine the changes it makes to the variables.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
```

Given the initial state:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5.
- `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0.
- `suffZero` is `[0]`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `el` is `s1[n - 1]` and `el` is equal to '>'.
- `ol` is `totalOne`.
- `zr` is `0`.
- `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.
- `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.

The code updates the `ans` list at index `i` with the value `zeroInd - oneInd`.

The variables `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated based on the values of `suffZero`, `ol`, and `preOne` respectively. However, the specific values of `func_1(suffZero, ol)` and `func_1(preOne, 1)` are not provided, so we'll keep them in their functional form.

After executing the code, the `ans` list at index `i` (which is `n-1`) will be updated with the value `zeroInd - oneInd`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `s1` remains a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` remains a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5.
- `pre` remains a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` remains the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `preOne` remains a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0.
- `suffZero` remains `[0]`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `i` (which is `n-1`) where it is `zeroInd - oneInd`.
- `i` remains `n - 1`.
- `el` remains `s1[n - 1]` and `el` is equal to '>'.
- `ol` remains `totalOne`.
- `zr` remains `0`.
- `zeroInd` remains `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.
- `oneInd` remains `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0; `suffZero` is `[0]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `n-1` where it is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne) - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`; `i` is `n - 1`; `el` is `s1[n - 1]` and `el` is equal to '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `0`; `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)`; `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`**.
