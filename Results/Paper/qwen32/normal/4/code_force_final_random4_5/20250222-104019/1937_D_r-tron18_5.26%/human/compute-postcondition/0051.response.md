The code snippet calculates `zeroInd` by summing the last two elements of the `suffZero` list. Let's break down the possible values of `suffZero` based on the value of `el`.

1. If `el` is '>', then `suffZero` is `[0, n - 1]`.
2. If `el` is '<', then `suffZero` is `[0, n, 2n - 1]`.

Given these conditions:

- If `el` is '>', `zeroInd` will be `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` = `(n - 1) + 0` = `n - 1`.
- If `el` is '<', `zeroInd` will be `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` = `(2n - 1) + n` = `3n - 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0, n - 1]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n, 2n - 1]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `n-1` where it is calculated based on the condition `ol <= zr`; `i` is `n - 2`; `el` is `s1[n - 2]`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `1` if `el` is '>', otherwise `zr` is `2`; `zeroInd` is `n - 1` if `el` is '>', otherwise `zeroInd` is `3n - 1`.**
