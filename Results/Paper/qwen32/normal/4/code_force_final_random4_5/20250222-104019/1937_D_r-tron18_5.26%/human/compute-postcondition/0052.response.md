To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the impact of the line `oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`. We'll break down the variables involved and the potential outcomes.

1. **`preOne`**: This is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0. The exact values depend on the string `s1` and the positions of the '>' characters.

2. **`zr`**: This is either `1` if `el` is '>', or `2` if `el` is '<'. Given that `el` is `s1[n - 2]`, the value of `zr` is determined by the character at the second-to-last position in `s1`.

3. **`func_1(preOne, zr)`**: This function takes `preOne` and `zr` as arguments. Without the specific implementation of `func_1`, we can't determine the exact value it returns. However, we can assume that the function returns a value based on `preOne` and `zr`.

4. **`oneInd`**: This variable is assigned the value `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`, meaning it is twice the value returned by `func_1`.

Given these points, the value of `oneInd` will be `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`. Since we don't have the definition of `func_1`, we can't simplify this further, but we know the relationship.

Now, let's update the output state:
- The value of `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0, n - 1]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n, 2n - 1]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `n-1` where it is calculated based on the condition `ol <= zr`; `i` is `n - 2`; `el` is `s1[n - 2]`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `1` if `el` is '>', otherwise `zr` is `2`; `zeroInd` is `n - 1` if `el` is '>', otherwise `zeroInd` is `3n - 1`; `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`**
