The code snippet provided is `totalOne -= 1`, which means the value of `totalOne` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on the value of `el` and is now decreased by 1; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element removed; `suffZero` is adjusted based on the value of `el`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `n-1` and possibly at index `n-2` where they are calculated based on the conditions involving `el`, `ol`, and `zr`; `i` is `i - 1`; `el` is updated to `s1[i - 1]`; `ol` is `totalOne` (before it was decremented); `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`. The last element of `preOne` has been removed.**

In simpler terms, `totalOne` has been decreased by 1, and all other variables remain in their previous states.
