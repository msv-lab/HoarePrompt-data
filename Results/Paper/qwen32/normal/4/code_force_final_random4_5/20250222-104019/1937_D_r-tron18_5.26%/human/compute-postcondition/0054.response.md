To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and how it affects the variables. The code snippet calculates the value of `zeroInd` using a function `func_1` applied to `suffZero` with specific arguments.

Given:
- `suffZero` is `[0, n - 1]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n, 2n - 1]`.
- `ol` is `totalOne`.
- `zr` is `1` if `el` is '>', otherwise `zr` is `2`.

The code calculates `zeroInd` as:
```
zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
```

Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot compute the exact value of `zeroInd`. However, we can describe the output state in terms of the function calls and the variables involved.

Let's summarize the output state:
- The value of `zeroInd` is now calculated based on the function `func_1` applied to `suffZero` with arguments `ol + 1` and `1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0, n - 1]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n, 2n - 1]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `n-1` where it is calculated based on the condition `ol <= zr`; `i` is `n - 2`; `el` is `s1[n - 2]`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `1` if `el` is '>', otherwise `zr` is `2`; `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`.**
