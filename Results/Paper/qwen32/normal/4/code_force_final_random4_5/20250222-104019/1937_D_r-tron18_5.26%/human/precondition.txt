arr is a list of strings, where each string consists of characters '<' and '>', and times is a list of integers representing the lengths of the corresponding strings in arr, such that len(arr) = len(times) and for each i, 1 <= times[i] <= 5 * 10^5. The sum of all elements in times does not exceed 5 * 10^5.
