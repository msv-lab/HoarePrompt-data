To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given code snippet and how it modifies the existing variables.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
```

Given the initial state:
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0.
- `func_1` is a function that we need to consider. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the problem statement, we need to make assumptions based on typical patterns in such problems. Often, `func_1` could be a binary search function or something similar, but without the exact definition, we can only proceed with a general understanding.

Since `func_1(preOne, 1)` is not explicitly defined, we will assume it returns the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `preOne`. Given that `preOne` starts with `0` and then has cumulative counts of `>` characters, `func_1(preOne, 1)` would return the index of the first `1` in `preOne`.

Let's assume `preOne` looks something like this: `[0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]` (this is an example, the actual values depend on the input string `s1`).

- `preOne[-1]` would be the last element in `preOne`, which is the total count of `>` characters, i.e., `totalOne`.
- `func_1(preOne, 1)` would return the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `preOne`. For the example list above, it would return `1`.

Now, we can compute `oneInd`:
```python
oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
```
Using our example values:
```python
oneInd = 2 * 4 - 1  # assuming preOne[-1] is 4 and func_1(preOne, 1) is 1
oneInd = 8 - 1
oneInd = 7
```

So, `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.

The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0; `suffZero` is `[0]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros; `i` is `n - 1`; `el` is `s1[n - 1]` and `el` is equal to '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `0`; `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`; `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`**.

In natural language: The variable `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
