Initial State: `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element removed; `suffZero` is `[0]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `n-1` where it is calculated based on the condition `ol <= zr`. If `ol <= zr`, then `ans[n-1]` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne) - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`. Otherwise, `ans[n-1]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. `i` is `n - 1`; `el` is `s1[n - 1]` and `el` is equal to '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `0`. If `ol <= zr`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. If `ol > zr`, `zeroInd` is `0` and `oneInd` is `preOne[1] - x`, and `fi` is `1`.

The code snippet provided is:
```
totalOne -= 1
```

This line of code decrements the value of `totalOne` by 1.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element removed; `suffZero` is `[0]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `n-1` where it is calculated based on the condition `ol <= zr`. If `ol <= zr`, then `ans[n-1]` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne) - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`. Otherwise, `ans[n-1]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. `i` is `n - 1`; `el` is `s1[n - 1]` and `el` is equal to '>'; `ol` is `totalOne` plus 1; `zr` is `0`. If `ol <= zr`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. If `ol > zr`, `zeroInd` is `0` and `oneInd` is `preOne[1] - x`, and `fi` is `1`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `totalOne` has been decreased by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged.
