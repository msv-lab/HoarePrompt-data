To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze the logic and ensure that it correctly simulates the behavior of the pinball as described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of the reasoning:

### Problem Recap:
- The pinball moves based on the direction indicated by the character ('<' or '>') in the grid.
- The character is inverted after the pinball moves.
- The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.
- For each cell `i` from `1` to `n`, we need to determine how many seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

### Program Analysis:
The provided code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(arr, times)`: This function calculates an offset based on the accumulated values in `arr` and the number of times. It is used to compute indices for the main logic.
2. `func_2(s1, n)`: This function processes the string `s1` and computes the number of seconds for each pinball to leave the grid by maintaining prefix and suffix sums of positions of '>' and '<' characters.

### Detailed Breakdown of `func_2`:
- **Initialization**:
  - `pre` is a list of positions of '>' characters.
  - `preOne` is the accumulated sum of positions of '>' characters.
  - `suffZero` is a list that will store accumulated sums of positions of '<' characters.
  - `ans` is the result array that will store the number of seconds for each pinball to leave the grid.

- **Processing**:
  - The function iterates over the string `s1` from right to left.
  - For each character:
    - If the character is '>', it calculates indices based on the number of '>' and '<' characters seen so far.
    - If the character is '<', it updates the `suffZero` list and calculates indices similarly.
  - The calculations involve complex logic to determine the number of moves required for the pinball to leave the grid.

### Function Summary:
The function `func_2` computes the number of seconds for each pinball to leave the grid based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters in the string. The function prints the list `ans` after processing the string.

### Testing with Example Inputs:
Let's test the code with the provided example inputs to see if it produces the correct output.

```python
# Example input
input_data = """3

# Function to simulate the input
def simulate_input(data):
    input_lines = data.split('\n')
    def input_func():
        return input_lines.pop(0)
    return input_func

# Redirecting input
import sys
sys.stdin = simulate_input(input_data)

# Running the function

    import sys
    import itertools
    def func_1(arr, times):
        l = len(arr)
        return arr[-1] - arr[max(-l, -1 - times)]

    def func_2(s1, n):
        pre = [i + 1 for (i, el) in enumerate(s1) if el == '>']
        totalOne = len(pre)
        preOne = list(itertools.accumulate(pre, initial=0))
        suffZero = [0]
        ans = [0] * n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            el = s1[i]
            if el == '>':
                (ol, zr) = (totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1)
                if ol <= zr:
                    zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
                    oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
                    ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
                else:
                    zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
                    oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
                    oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
                    fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
                    ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
                preOne.pop()
                totalOne -= 1
            else:
                suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
                (ol, zr) = (totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1)
                if zr <= ol:
                    zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
                    oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
                    ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
                else:
                    zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
                    oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
                    ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
        print(*ans)

    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        s1 = data[index]
        index += 1
        func_2(s1, n)
