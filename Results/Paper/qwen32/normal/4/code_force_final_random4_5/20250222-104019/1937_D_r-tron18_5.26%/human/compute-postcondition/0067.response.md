The given code snippet modifies the value of `oneInd` by subtracting the result of `func_1(preOne, 1)` from it. The other variables (`s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `i`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`) remain unchanged based on the provided code.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on the value of `el`; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element potentially removed; `suffZero` is adjusted based on the value of `el`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `n-1` and possibly at index `n-2` where they are calculated based on the conditions involving `el`, `ol`, and `zr`; `i` is `i - 1`; `el` is updated to `s1[i - 1]`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is 2 * suffZero[-1]; `oneInd` is calculated as `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`**.
