The code snippet provided is `preOne.pop()`, which removes the last element from the list `preOne`. 

Given the initial state, `preOne` is described as a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'. Since the code removes the last element of `preOne`, the last element of `preOne` is no longer part of the list.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element removed; `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `n-1` and possibly at index `n-2` where they are calculated based on the conditions; if `ol <= zr`, `ans[n-1]` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne) - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))` and `ans[n-2]` is `zeroInd - oneInd` where `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. If `ol > zr`, `ans[n-1]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi` and `ans[n-2]` is `zeroInd - oneInd` where `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]` and `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`. `i` is updated to `n - 2` or `n - 3` based on the condition, `el` is updated to `s1[n - 2]` or `s1[n - 3]`, and `ol` and `zr` remain unchanged. `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi` are calculated based on the conditions involving `el`, `ol`, and `zr`.**
