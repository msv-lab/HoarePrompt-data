The code snippet `totalOne -= 1` decrements the value of `totalOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 2 if `el` is '>', otherwise it is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element removed; `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `n-1` and possibly at index `n-2` where they are calculated based on the conditions; `i` is updated to `n - 2` or `n - 3` based on the condition, `el` is updated to `s1[n - 2]` or `s1[n - 3]`, and `ol` and `zr` remain unchanged. `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi` are calculated based on the conditions involving `el`, `ol`, and `zr`.**
