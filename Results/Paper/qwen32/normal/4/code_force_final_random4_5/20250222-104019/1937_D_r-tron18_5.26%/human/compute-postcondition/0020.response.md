The code snippet provided is `preOne.pop()`. This line of code removes the last element from the list `preOne`. 

Since `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, and it starts with an initial value of 0, removing the last element means that the length of `preOne` is reduced by 1, and the last cumulative count is no longer present.

The other variables such as `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `i`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the `pop()` operation on `preOne`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element removed; `suffZero` is `[0]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `n-1` where it is calculated based on the condition `ol <= zr`. If `ol <= zr`, then `ans[n-1]` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne) - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`. Otherwise, `ans[n-1]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. `i` is `n - 1`; `el` is `s1[n - 1]` and `el` is equal to '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `0`. If `ol <= zr`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. If `ol > zr`, `zeroInd` is `0` and `oneInd` is `preOne[1] - x`, and `fi` is `1`.**
