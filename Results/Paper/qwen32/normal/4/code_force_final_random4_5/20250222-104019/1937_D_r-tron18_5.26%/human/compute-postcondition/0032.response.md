The code snippet `ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd` updates the value of `ans[i]` based on the values of `zeroInd` and `oneInd`. 

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `zeroInd` is `1`
- `oneInd` is `2 * totalOne`

Therefore, `ans[i]` will be updated to `1 - 2 * totalOne`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0; `suffZero` is `[0, n]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros with `ans[n - 1]` updated to `1 - 2 * totalOne`; `i` is `n - 1`; `el` is `s1[n - 1]`, and `el` is not equal to '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `1`; and `zr` is greater than `ol`; `zeroInd` is `1`; `oneInd` is `2 * totalOne`.**
