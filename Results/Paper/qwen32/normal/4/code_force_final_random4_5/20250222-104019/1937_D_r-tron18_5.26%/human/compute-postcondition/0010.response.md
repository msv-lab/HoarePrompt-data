To determine the output state, we need to focus on the line of code provided and see how it affects the variables. The line of code is:

```python
zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
```

Given the initial state, we know the following:
- `suffZero` is `[0]`
- `ol` is `totalOne`, which is the number of '>' characters in `s1`
- `func_1` is a function that takes `suffZero` and `ol` as arguments, but we do not have its definition. However, we can infer that `func_1(suffZero, ol)` will return some value based on these inputs.

Since `suffZero` is `[0]` and `ol` is `totalOne`, the value of `func_1(suffZero, ol)` depends on the definition of `func_1`. Without the definition of `func_1`, we can't determine the exact value it returns, but we can still express `zeroInd` in terms of the return value of `func_1`.

Let's denote the return value of `func_1(suffZero, ol)` as `result`. Therefore, `zeroInd` will be `2 * result`.

The output state will reflect the new value of `zeroInd` and keep all other variables as they were, except for those that might be implicitly changed by `func_1` if it modifies its arguments. Since there's no indication that `func_1` modifies its arguments, we assume `suffZero` and `ol` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0; `suffZero` is `[0]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros; `i` is `n - 1`; `el` is `s1[n - 1]` and `el` is equal to '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `0`. Additionally, `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`. `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`**
