To determine the output state, we need to focus on the impact of the given line of code on the variables involved. The line in question is:

```python
zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
```

This line calculates the new value of `zeroInd` by calling `func_1(suffZero, ol)` and then multiplying the result by 2. The values of `suffZero` and `ol` are already defined and will be passed to the function `func_1`.

### Analysis:
- `zeroInd` is recalculated based on the result of `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.
- The values of `suffZero` and `ol` are not changed by this line.
- The values of other variables (`s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `i`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `oneInd`) remain unchanged unless directly affected by this line.

### Output State:
The output state will reflect the new value of `zeroInd` and will maintain the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on the value of `el`; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element potentially removed; `suffZero` is adjusted based on the value of `el`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `n-1` and possibly at index `n-2` where they are calculated based on the conditions involving `el`, `ol`, and `zr`; `i` is `i - 1`; `el` is updated to `s1[i - 1]`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`; `oneInd` is calculated based on the conditions involving `el`, `ol`, and `zr`.**
