The provided code snippet updates the values of `a` and `x` by reading them from the input. The initial state of `a` and `x` is not specified, but after the code executes, `a` and `x` will be set to the first and second integers from the input, respectively. The other variables (`bx`, `ax`, `t`, `n`, `cx`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is 1 or `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `t` is at least 1, `n` is at least 2, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `x`.**
