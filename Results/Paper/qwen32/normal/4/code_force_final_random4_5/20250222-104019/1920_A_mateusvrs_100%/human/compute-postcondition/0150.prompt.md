You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. Each of the t test cases starts with an integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. Following n lines describe the constraints for each test case, where each line contains two integers a and x, where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. a=1 means k must be greater than or equal to x, a=2 means k must be less than or equal to x, and a=3 means k must be not equal to x. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and no two constraints are the same.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    r = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        cx = set()
        
        ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
        
        bx = -1
        
        for _ in range(n):
            a, x = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                bx = max(x, bx)
            elif a == 2:
                ax = min(x, ax)
            else:
                cx.add(x)
        
        if bx > ax:
            r.append(0)
        else:
            tmp = 0
            for i in cx:
                if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                    tmp += 1
            r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
        
    #State: r contains the final results for all t test cases.
    print(*r, sep='\n')
    #This is printed: each element of the list `r` printed on a new line
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and `n` pairs of integers `(a, x)`. For each test case, the function evaluates the constraints: if `a` is 1, `k` must be greater than or equal to `x`; if `a` is 2, `k` must be less than or equal to `x`; if `a` is 3, `k` must not be equal to `x`. The function returns a value indicating whether there exists an integer `k` that satisfies all the constraints for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
