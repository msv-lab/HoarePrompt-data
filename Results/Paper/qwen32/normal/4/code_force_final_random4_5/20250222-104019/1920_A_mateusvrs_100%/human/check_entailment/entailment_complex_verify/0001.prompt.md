You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. Each of the t test cases starts with an integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. Following n lines describe the constraints for each test case, where each line contains two integers a and x, where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. a=1 means k must be greater than or equal to x, a=2 means k must be less than or equal to x, and a=3 means k must be not equal to x. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and no two constraints are the same.

    #This is printed: each element of the list `r` printed on a new line
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of constraints on an integer `k`. For each test case, it determines the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints and outputs the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes `t` to read the number of test cases.
   - It uses a list `r` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes `cx` as an empty set to store the values that `k` cannot be (type 3 constraints).
   - It initializes `ax` to a large number (`1000000000.0 + 7`) and `bx` to a small number (`-1`). `ax` will store the smallest upper bound (type 2 constraints), and `bx` will store the largest lower bound (type 1 constraints).

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, the program reads the type `a` and the value `x`.
   - If `a` is 1, it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and the current `bx` (to find the largest lower bound).
   - If `a` is 2, it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and the current `ax` (to find the smallest upper bound).
   - If `a` is 3, it adds `x` to the set `cx` (values that `k` cannot be).

3. **Calculating Valid `k` Values**:
   - After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, it means the lower bound is greater than the upper bound, making it impossible to find any valid `k`. Therefore, it appends `0` to the results list `r`.
   - If `bx` is not greater than `ax`, it calculates the total number of integers from `bx` to `ax` inclusive, which is `ax - bx + 1`.
   - It then subtracts the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` that are in the set `cx` (values that `k` cannot be). This is done by iterating through `cx` and counting how many values fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.

The program correctly handles each type of constraint and calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. It also correctly handles the case where no valid `k` exists by checking if the lower bound is greater than the upper bound.

Correctness: **True**
