Postcondition: **`bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` was 2, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` values where `a` was neither 1 nor 2, `t` is at least 1, and `n` is the number of iterations. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, `r` now contains an additional element `0`. Otherwise, `r` includes the new element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.**
