The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `n`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts. The loop will execute based on the value of `n`. 

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `cx` is an empty set; `ax` is 1000000007; `bx` is -1**
