### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and verify if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints (`n`).
   - It then reads `n` constraints, where each constraint is a pair `(a, x)`, indicating the type of constraint and the integer `x`.

2. **Constraints Processing:**
   - It initializes:
     - `cx` as a set to store the values that `k` must not be equal to.
     - `ax` to a large value (`1000000000 + 7`) to represent the upper bound.
     - `bx` to -1 to represent the lower bound.
   - It iterates over the constraints:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (`a == 1`), it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and the current `bx`, setting the lower bound.
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (`a == 2`), it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and the current `ax`, setting the upper bound.
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (`a == 3`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`, indicating that `k` cannot be equal to `x`.
   
3. **Validation and Counting:**
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if the lower bound `bx` is greater than the upper bound `ax`. If so, it means there are no valid integers `k` that can satisfy all constraints, and it appends `0` to the result list.
   - Otherwise, it counts the number of integers between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive) that are not in the set `cx`:
     - It initializes `tmp` to 0, which will count how many of these integers are in `cx`.
     - It iterates over each element in `cx` and increments `tmp` if the element is within the range `[bx, ax]`.
     - The number of valid integers `k` is then calculated as `(ax - bx + 1) - tmp`.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Verification:
- The program correctly handles the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints.
- It ensures that the lower and upper bounds are correctly set and checks for impossible cases where `bx > ax`.
- The counting of invalid integers within the range `[bx, ax]` is accurate.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correctly implemented based on the problem description and the provided example cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
