The code snippet `ax = min(x, ax)` updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `x`. 

Let's analyze the possible states of `ax` before and after the execution of the code:

- If `a` is 1, `ax` is initially 1000000007. After the execution, `ax` will be the minimum of `x` and 1000000007.
- If `a` is 2, `ax` is initially the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. After the execution, `ax` will still be the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, which means `ax` remains unchanged.
- If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `ax` is initially 1000000007. After the execution, `ax` will be the minimum of `x` and 1000000007.

The values of other variables (`a`, `x`, `bx`, `cx`, `t`, `n`, `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` contains the value `x`, `t` is at least 1 and `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and `n` is `n - 1`, `r` contains elements as per its initial condition or previous updates.**
