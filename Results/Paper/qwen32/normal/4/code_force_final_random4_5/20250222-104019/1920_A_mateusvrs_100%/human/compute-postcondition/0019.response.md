The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `x`. This means the values of `a` and `x` will be updated based on the input, while all other variables (`t`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing the value `x`; `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `1000000007`; `bx` is max(x, -1) if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1; `a` is the first integer from the input; `x` is the second integer from the input.**
