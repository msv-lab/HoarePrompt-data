Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `a` is the first integer from the input; `x` is the second integer from the input; `cx` is a set containing the value `x` if `a` is 2, otherwise `cx` is an empty set; `ax` is `min(x, 1000000007)` if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007; `bx` is `max(x, -1)` if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1.**
