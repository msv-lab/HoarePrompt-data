Let's analyze the code snippet and determine the new state of the variables.

Initial State:
- `a` is the first integer from the input.
- `x` is the second integer from the input.
- `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1.
- `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is 1 or `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007.
- `t` is at least 1.
- `n` is at least 2.
- `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `x`.

Code Snippet:
```
bx = max(x, bx)
```

This line updates `bx` to be the maximum of its current value and `x`.

We need to consider the initial value of `bx`:
- If `a` is 1, `bx` is initially `max(x, -1)`.
- If `a` is not 1, `bx` is initially `-1`.

Let's consider both cases:

1. If `a` is 1:
   - `bx` is initially `max(x, -1)`.
   - `bx = max(x, max(x, -1))` simplifies to `bx = max(x, -1)`, which is the same as the initial value of `bx`.

2. If `a` is not 1:
   - `bx` is initially `-1`.
   - `bx = max(x, -1)` means `bx` will be updated to `x` if `x > -1`, otherwise it will remain `-1`.

So, the updated value of `bx` will be:
- `max(x, -1)` if `a` is 1.
- `max(x, -1)` if `a` is not 1.

In both cases, `bx` becomes `max(x, -1)`.

Other variables (`a`, `x`, `ax`, `t`, `n`, `cx`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `bx` is `max(x, -1)`, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is 1 or `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `t` is at least 1, `n` is at least 2, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `x`.**
