Postcondition: **`a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `bx` is `max(x, -1)` if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1, `ax` is `min(x, 1000000007)` if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` is `x` if `a` is not 2 and `x` is less than or equal to 1000000007, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `x`, `t` is at least 1, `n` is at least 1.**
