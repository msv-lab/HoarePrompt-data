The only variable in the loop head of the provided `for` loop is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not intend to use. This means that the loop will execute `n` times regardless of the state of any other variable. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` itself, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be decremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing the value `x`; `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `1000000007`; `bx` is max(x, -1) if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1; `a` is the first integer from the input; `x` is the second integer from the input.**
