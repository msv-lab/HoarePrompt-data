The code snippet provided initializes a variable `tmp` to 0. This assignment does not affect any of the other variables (`bx`, `ax`, `cx`, `t`, `n`, `r`) mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `bx`, `ax`, `cx`, `t`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`bx` is the maximum `x` encountered when `a == 1`, `ax` is the minimum `x` encountered when `a == 2`, `cx` is a set of all `x` encountered when `a == 3`, `t` is `t - n`, `n` is 0, `r` remains unchanged, and `tmp` is 0.**
