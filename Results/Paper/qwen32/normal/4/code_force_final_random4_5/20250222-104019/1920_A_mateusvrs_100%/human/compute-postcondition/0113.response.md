Postcondition: **`bx` is -1, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007. `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 2, otherwise `cx` contains the value `x`. `t` is `t - 1` and `t` is at least 1. `n` is greater than or equal to 1. `r` contains elements as per its initial condition or previous updates. `a` is an integer not equal to 1. `x` is the second integer from the input.**
