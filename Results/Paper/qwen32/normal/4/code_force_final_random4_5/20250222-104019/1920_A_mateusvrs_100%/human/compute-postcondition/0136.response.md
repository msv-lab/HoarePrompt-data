The code snippet `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the value of `tmp` will be 1 after this operation, and all other variables will retain their initial values.

Output State: **`bx` is the maximum `x` encountered when `a == 1`, `ax` is the minimum `x` encountered when `a == 2`, `cx` is a set of all `x` encountered when `a == 3` that must have at least one element, `t` is `t - n`, `n` is 0, `r` remains unchanged, and `tmp` is 1. The current value of `i` is the first element in `cx` and satisfies `i >= bx` and `i <= ax`.**
