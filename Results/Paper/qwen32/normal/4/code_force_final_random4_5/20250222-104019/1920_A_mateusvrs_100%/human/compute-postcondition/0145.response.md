The code snippet appends a calculated value to the list `r`. The value being appended is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `ax` is the minimum `x` encountered when `a == 2`, `bx` is the maximum `x` encountered when `a == 1`, and `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` (a set of all `x` encountered when `a == 3`) that satisfy the condition `i >= bx` and `i <= ax`.

After executing the code, the list `r` will have a new element added to it, and the values of `bx`, `ax`, `cx`, `t`, `n`, and `tmp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`bx` is the maximum `x` encountered when `a == 1`, `ax` is the minimum `x` encountered when `a == 2`, `cx` is a set of all `x` encountered when `a == 3`, `t` is `t - n`, `n` is 0, `r` has a new element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` appended to it, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that satisfy `i >= bx` and `i <= ax`.**
