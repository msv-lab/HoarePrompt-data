Postcondition: **`a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1. If `a` is 2, `ax` is `min(x, 1000000007)`, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007. `t` is at least 1, `n` is at least 2. If `a` is 1 or 2, `cx` is an empty set, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `x`.**
