Output State: **`t` is at least 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input; `x` is 0, 1, or 2; `y` is 1, 2, or `x + 1` and `y` must be at least `x`; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The only change is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
