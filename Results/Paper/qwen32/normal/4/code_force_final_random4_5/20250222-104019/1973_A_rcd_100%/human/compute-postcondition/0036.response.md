The provided Python code snippet contains a `print(-1)` statement. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`) and their constraints, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value printed is not dependent on the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, or `p3`.

Since the `print` statement is `print(-1)`, it will output the integer `-1` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **-1**
