Output State: **`t` is at least 0; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\), and they hold the values read from the input; The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the current value of `p3` remains greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`. Otherwise, `p3` retains its original value; `x` is 0; `y` is equal to `p3`; `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `x`, and `y` remain the same as in the initial state, and the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
