Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2` and at least 1; `x` and `y` are such that `y >= x`. If `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change is made to `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `x`, or `y`.**
