Output State: **`t` is at least 0; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\), and they hold the values read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the current value of `p3` remains greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`. Otherwise, `p3` retains its original value; if `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, then `x` is 0 and `y` is equal to `p3`; otherwise, `x` is 1 and `y` is equal to `p3 - 1`. Ensure `y` is at least as large as `x` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `x`, and `y` remain as per the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
