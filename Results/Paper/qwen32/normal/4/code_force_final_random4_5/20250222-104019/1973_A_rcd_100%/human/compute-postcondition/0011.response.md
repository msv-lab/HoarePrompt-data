Output State: **`t` is at least 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, and they hold the values read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. Additionally, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`. `x` is 0. `y` is equal to `p3`.**

In simple terms, the variable `y` has been assigned the value of `p3`, while all other variables retain their initial values and constraints.
