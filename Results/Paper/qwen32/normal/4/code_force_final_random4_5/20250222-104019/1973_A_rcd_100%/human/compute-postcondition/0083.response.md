The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `x`, or `y`. It only terminates the most internal loop or if statement it is placed in. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input; `x` is 0 or 1; `y` is `x + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
