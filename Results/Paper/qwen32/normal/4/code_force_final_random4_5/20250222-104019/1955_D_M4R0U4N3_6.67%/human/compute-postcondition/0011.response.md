The code snippet adds the first element of the list `a` to the set `extra`. The set `done` remains empty, and the set `todo` remains unchanged. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `j`, and the elements of list `a` (other than `a[j]`) also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `todo` is a set of integers read from the input, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is a set containing `a[0]`, `j` is 0, and `a[j]` is not in `todo`.**
