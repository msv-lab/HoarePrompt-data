The code snippet adds the element `a[r]` to the set `done`. The initial state specifies that `a[r]` is not in `todo` and `done` does not contain `a[r]`. After executing the code, `a[r]` will be added to `done`, so `done` will now contain `a[r]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a[r]` is not in `todo`, `done` contains `a[r]`, `extra` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `m` is less than `n`, `k` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `old` is `a[r - m]`.**
