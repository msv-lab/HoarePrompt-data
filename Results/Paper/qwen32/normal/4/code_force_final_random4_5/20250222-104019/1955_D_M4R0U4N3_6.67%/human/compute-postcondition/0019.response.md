Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `j` is 2. If `a[1]` is in `todo`, then `todo` is a set of integers read from the input with `a[1]` removed, `done` is a set containing `a[0]` and `a[1]` if `a[0]` was initially in `todo`, otherwise `done` is a set containing `a[1]`, and `extra` is a set containing `a[0]` if `a[0]` was not in `todo` initially, otherwise `extra` is an empty set. Otherwise, `todo` is a set of integers read from the input, `done` is a set containing `a[0]` if `a[0]` was initially in `todo`, otherwise `done` is an empty set, `extra` is a set containing `a[0]` if `a[0] was not in `todo`, otherwise `extra` is an empty set, and `extra` now also contains `a[1]`.

Code:
```
todo.remove(a[j])
```

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `j` is 2, `todo` is a set of integers with `a[j]` removed, `done` is a set containing `a[0]` and `a[1]` if `a[0]` was initially in `todo`, otherwise `done` is a set containing `a[1]` if `a[1]` was in `todo`, or `done` is a set containing `a[0]` if `a[0]` was in `todo`, `extra` is a set containing `a[0]` if `a[0]` was not in `todo` initially, otherwise `extra` is an empty set, and `extra` now also contains `a[1]` if `a[1]` was not in `todo` initially.**

In simpler terms, the value `a[j]` (which is `a[2]` since `j` is 2) has been removed from the set `todo`. The sets `done` and `extra` remain unchanged from their initial states.
