Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a logical error in handling the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra`. Specifically, the program is using sets to track elements, which do not account for the frequency of elements. Since the problem specifies that elements in arrays `a` and `b` can be repeated, the program should use dictionaries or counters to keep track of the frequency of elements instead of sets.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program using `Counter` from the `collections` module:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Count the frequency of elements in b
        b_count = Counter(b)
        # Count the frequency of elements in the first window of a
        window_count = Counter(a[:m])
        
        # Calculate the number of matches in the first window
        matches = sum(min(window_count[x], b_count[x]) for x in b_count)
        ans = 1 if matches >= k else 0
        
        # Slide the window over the array a
        for r in range(m, n):
            # Remove the element that is sliding out of the window
            old = a[r - m]
            if window_count[old] == 1:
                del window_count[old]
            else:
                window_count[old] -= 1
            
            # Add the new element that is sliding into the window
            new = a[r]
            window_count[new] += 1
            
            # Update the number of matches
            if old in b_count:
                matches -= min(window_count[old] + 1, b_count[old]) - min(window_count[old], b_count[old])
            if new in b_count:
                matches += min(window_count[new], b_count[new]) - min(window_count[new] - 1, b_count[new])
            
            # Check if the current window is good
            if matches >= k:
                ans += 1
        
        print(ans)

# Call the function to execute the code
func()
```

This corrected program uses `Counter` to keep track of the frequency of elements in the current window of `a` and compares it against the frequency of elements in `b`. It correctly handles repeated elements and counts the number of good subsegments.
