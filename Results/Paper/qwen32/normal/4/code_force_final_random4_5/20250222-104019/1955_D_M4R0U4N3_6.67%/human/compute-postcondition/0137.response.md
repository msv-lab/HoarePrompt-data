The code snippet provided removes the element `a[r]` from the set `todo`. Let's analyze the impact on the variables:

1. **`todo`**: The element `a[r]` is removed from this set.
2. **`done`**: No changes are made to `done` by this code snippet.
3. **`extra`**: No changes are made to `extra` by this code snippet.
4. **`ans`**: The value of `ans` remains unchanged. It is determined based on the number of elements in `done` compared to `k`, which is not affected by this operation.
5. **`r`**: The value of `r` remains unchanged as it is just used to index `a`.
6. **`a`**: The list `a` remains unchanged.
7. **`n`, `m`, `k`, `old`**: These variables remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`todo` does not include `a[r]`, `done` is the set of all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo`, except `old` if `old` is in `done`, and `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`. `a[r]` is added to `done`. `extra` includes `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`. If `old` is in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`. If `old` is in `done`, `todo` includes `old`. If `old` is in `done` and in `extra`, `old` is removed from both `done` and `extra`; otherwise, if `old` is in `done`, it is removed from `done` and `todo` includes `old`. `n` remains unchanged, `m` is less than `n`, `k` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `old` is `a[2]`. `r` is `m + 2`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 3; otherwise, `ans` is 2.**
