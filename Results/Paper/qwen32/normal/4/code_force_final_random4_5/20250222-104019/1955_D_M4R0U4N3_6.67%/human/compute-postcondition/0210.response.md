The code snippet adds the value of `a[r]` to the set `done`. The value of `a[r]` is removed from `todo` as per the initial state description. No changes are made to `extra`, `old`, or `r`.

Output State: **`r` is `r + 1`; `old` is `a[r - m]`. If `old` was in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`. If `old` was in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added to `todo`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `done` or `todo`. `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and added to `done`.**
