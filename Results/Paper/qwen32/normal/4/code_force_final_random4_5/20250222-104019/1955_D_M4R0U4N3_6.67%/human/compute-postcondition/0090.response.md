The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `m`.

Given that `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust `j` to be the next value it should take in the loop.

State: **`done`, `todo`, `extra`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a` are defined as per the initial conditions, `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` is now the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.**

To be more specific, if `j` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `x + 1`. Since the problem doesn't specify the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, we can just state that `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

State: **`done`, `todo`, `extra`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a` are defined as per the initial conditions, `j` is incremented by 1.**

Since we are only concerned with adjusting the loop head variables and `j` is the only variable in the loop head, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`done`, `todo`, `extra`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a` are defined as per the initial conditions, `j` is incremented by 1.**

To make it clear, if `j` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` would be 3. So generally:

State: **`done`, `todo`, `extra`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a` are defined as per the initial conditions, `j` is `j + 1`.**

Given the format, we can write:

State: **`done`, `todo`, `extra`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a` are defined as per the initial conditions, `j` is incremented by 1.**
