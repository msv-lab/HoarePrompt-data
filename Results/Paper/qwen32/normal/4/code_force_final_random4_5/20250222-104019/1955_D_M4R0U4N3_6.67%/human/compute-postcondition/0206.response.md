The code snippet `todo.add(old)` adds the value of `old` to the set `todo`. This operation does not change the values of `r`, `old`, or `done`; it only modifies the set `todo` by adding `old` to it.

Output State: **`r` is `r + 1`; `old` is `a[r - m]`; `done` has `a[r - m]` removed from it; `todo` includes `old`.**
