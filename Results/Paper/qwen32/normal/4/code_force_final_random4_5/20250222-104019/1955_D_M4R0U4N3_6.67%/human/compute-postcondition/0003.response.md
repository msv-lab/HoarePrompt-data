The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and then creates a set from these integers. This set is assigned to the variable `todo`.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` are not affected by this code snippet. The variable `todo` is newly introduced and will hold the set of integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `todo` is a set of integers read from the input.**
