The code snippet `done.remove(old)` removes the element `old` from the set `done`. Given the initial state, `old` is defined as `a[r - m]`. After the removal, `done` will no longer contain the element `a[r - m]`.

Output State: **`r` is `r + 1`; `old` is `a[r - m]`; `done` has `a[r - m]` removed from it.**
