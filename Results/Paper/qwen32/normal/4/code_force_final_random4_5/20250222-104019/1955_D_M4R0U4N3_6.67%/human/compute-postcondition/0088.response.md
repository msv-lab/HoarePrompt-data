The code snippet `extra.add(a[j])` adds the element at index `j` of list `a` to the set `extra`. This means the set `extra` will now include the element `a[j]` if it was not already present.

Given the initial state, `j` has been incremented by 1 from the previous iteration, so `j` is now `j + 1`. The values of `done`, `todo`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged except for `extra` which will have the new element added to it.

Output State: **`done`, `todo`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a` are defined as per the initial conditions; `j` is `j + 1`; `extra` includes the element `a[j]` from the list `a`.**
