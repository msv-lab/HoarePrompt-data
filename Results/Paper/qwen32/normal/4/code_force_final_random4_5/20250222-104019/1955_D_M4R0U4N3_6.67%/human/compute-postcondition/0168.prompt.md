Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `done` is an empty set; `todo` contains unique integers from the input; `extra` is an empty set; `ans` reflects the number of times `len(done) >= k`; `n` is the first input integer; `m` is the second input integer; `k` is the third input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    if a[j] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[j])
        done.add(a[j])
    else:
        extra.add(a[j])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `done` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` is an empty set. `todo` contains unique integers from the input except `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise `todo` remains unchanged. `extra` contains the element `a[j]` if `a[j]` was not in `todo`, otherwise `extra` remains an empty set. `ans` reflects the number of times `len(done) >= k`. `n` is the first input integer; `m` must be greater than 0; `k` is the third input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `j` is not adjusted before the loop starts.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `done` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` is an empty set. `todo` contains unique integers from the input except `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise `todo` remains unchanged. `extra` contains the element `a[j]` if `a[j]` was not in `todo`, otherwise `extra` remains an empty set. `ans` reflects the number of times `len(done) >= k`. `n` is the first input integer; `m` must be greater than 0; `k` is the third input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `j` is `j + 1`. If `a[j]` was in `todo`, it has been removed from `todo` and added to `done`. If `a[j]` was not in `todo`, it has been added to `extra`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is `j + 1`, `m` must be greater than `j`. If `a[j]` was in `todo`, it has been removed from `todo` and added to `done`. Otherwise, `a[j]` has been added to `extra`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
