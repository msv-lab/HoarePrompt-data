Postcondition: **`done` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` is an empty set. `todo` contains unique integers from the input except `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise `todo` remains unchanged. `extra` contains the element `a[j]` if `a[j]` was not in `todo`, otherwise `extra` remains an empty set. `ans` reflects the number of times `len(done) >= k`. `n` is the first input integer; `m` must be greater than 0; `k` is the third input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `j` is `j + 1`. If `a[j]` was in `todo`, it has been removed from `todo` and added to `done`. If `a[j]` was not in `todo`, it has been added to `extra`.**
