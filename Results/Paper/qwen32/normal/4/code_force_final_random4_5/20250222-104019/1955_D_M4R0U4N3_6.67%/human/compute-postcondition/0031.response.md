The code removes the value of `old` from the set `done`. Since `old` was in `done`, it will no longer be present in `done` after the execution. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`, `old` is not in `extra`, and `old` is not in `done`.**
