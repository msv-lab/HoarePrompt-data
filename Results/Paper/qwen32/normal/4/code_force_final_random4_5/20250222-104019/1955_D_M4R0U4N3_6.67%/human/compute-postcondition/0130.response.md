The only variable in the loop head is `r`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop continues as long as `r` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is `m + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `r` must be incremented by 1.

Given that `r` is currently `m + 1`, the next value of `r` should be `m + 2` to ensure the loop can execute again.

State: **`done` is the set of all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo`, except `old` if `old` is in `done`, and `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`. `a[r]` is added to `done`. `extra` includes `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`. If `old` is in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`. If `old` is in `done`, `todo` includes `old`. `n` remains unchanged, `m` is less than `n`, `k` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `old` is `a[r - m]`. `todo` does not include `a[r]` if `a[r]` was in `todo`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 3; otherwise, `ans` is 2. `r` is `m + 2`**
