The code snippet `todo.remove(a[r])` removes the element `a[r]` from the set `todo`. Given the initial state, `a[r]` was in `todo`, and removing it will update the `todo` set. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]` and is not an element of `extra`. If `old` is in `done`, then `old` is also in `todo`. Additionally, `a[r]` is not in `todo` after the removal. The state remains unchanged with respect to `done` and `todo` except for the exclusion of `a[r]` from `todo`.**
