The code snippet `todo.add(old)` adds the value of `old` to the set `todo`. The values of `r`, `a`, `m`, and `done` are not directly affected by this operation, but the state of `todo` is updated to include the value of `old`.

Output State: **`r` is `r + 1`; `old` is `a[(r + 1) - m]`; `old` has been removed from the list `done`; `todo` includes `old`.**
