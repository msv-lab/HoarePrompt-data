The code removes the element at index `j` of the list `a` from the list `todo`. Therefore, the list `todo` will no longer contain the element `a[j]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`done`, `todo` is missing the element `a[j]`, `extra`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a` are defined as per the initial conditions, `j` is incremented by 1.**
