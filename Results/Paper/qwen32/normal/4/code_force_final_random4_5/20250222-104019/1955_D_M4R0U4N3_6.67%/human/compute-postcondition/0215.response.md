To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the variables `done`, `todo`, `extra`, and `ans` evolve with each iteration.

### Initial State Recap:
- `done`: Elements from `a` that were in `todo` and processed.
- `todo`: Elements from `a` that were in `todo` but not processed.
- `extra`: Elements from `a` that were not in `todo`.
- `ans`: 1 if `len(done) >= k`, otherwise 0.

### Loop Iteration Recap:
For each iteration `r` in the range `[m, n)`:
1. `old` is set to `a[r - m]`.
2. If `old` is in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`.
3. If `old` is in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added to `todo`.
4. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`.
5. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`.
6. If `len(done) >= k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.

### Final State Analysis:
After all iterations, the final state of the variables can be described as follows:
- `done`: Contains elements from `a` that were in `todo` at some point and processed, adjusted according to the removals and additions during the loop.
- `todo`: Contains elements from `a` that were in `todo` but not processed, adjusted according to the removals and additions during the loop.
- `extra`: Contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo` at any point, adjusted according to the removals and additions during the loop.
- `ans`: Incremented by 1 for each iteration where `len(done) >= k`.

### Natural Language Explanation:
- `done` will contain elements that were originally in `todo` and have been processed during the loop. Elements that were in `done` and then moved back to `todo` due to `old` being in `done` will be excluded from `done` unless they are processed again.
- `todo` will contain elements that were in `todo` but not processed, and elements that were moved from `done` to `todo` due to `old` being in `done`.
- `extra` will contain elements that were not in `todo` and remain so unless they are added to `todo` and then processed.
- `ans` will be incremented by 1 for each iteration where the number of processed elements (`done`) is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Final Output State:
Given the above analysis, the final output state after all iterations is:

Output State: **`done` contains elements from `a` that were in `todo` and processed, `todo` contains elements from `a` that were in `todo` but not processed, `extra` contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `len(done) >= k`.**
