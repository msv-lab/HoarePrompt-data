Output State: **`r` is `r + 2`, `old` is `a[r - m]`. If `a[r]` was in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. Otherwise, if `old` was in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`. If `old` was in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added to `todo`. Otherwise, there is no change to `done` or `todo`. Additionally, if `a[r]` was not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`. `ans` is `ans + 1`.**

In simple terms: The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The values of `r` and `old`, and the sets `done`, `todo`, and `extra` are updated according to the conditions specified, but `r` and `old` retain their expressions in terms of other variables.
