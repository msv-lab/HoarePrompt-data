The only variable in the loop head is `r`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `r`. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is `r + 1` and `r` is in the range from `m` to `n`.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `r` should be incremented by 1 from its current value at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, the new value of `r` should be `r + 2` (since `r` was `r + 1` at the end of the last iteration).

State: **`r` is `r + 2`, `old` is `a[(r + 2) - m]`** 

Note: The state of `old` is adjusted based on the new value of `r`, but other variables (`todo`, `done`, `extra`, `ans`) are not in the loop head and thus should not be adjusted here.
