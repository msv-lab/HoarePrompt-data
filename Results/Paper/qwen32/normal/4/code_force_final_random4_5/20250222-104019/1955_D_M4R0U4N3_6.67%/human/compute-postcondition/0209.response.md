Output State: **`r` is `r + 1`; `old` is `a[r - m]`. If `old` was in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`. If `old` was in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added to `todo`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `done` or `todo`. `a[r]` is removed from `todo`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `r` is incremented by 1. The variable `old` retains its value as `a[r - m]`, and any changes to `extra`, `done`, or `todo` related to `old` are preserved according to the initial conditions. The element `a[r]` is removed from the list `todo`.
