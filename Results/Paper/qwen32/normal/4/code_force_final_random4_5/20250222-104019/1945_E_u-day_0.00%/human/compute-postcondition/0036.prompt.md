Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the first value returned by `func_1()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present, otherwise `pos` is -1; `low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, and `st` is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
while low + 1 < high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    st.add(mid)
    if arr[mid] > k:
        high = mid
    else:
        low = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 2, `k` is the second value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present, otherwise `pos` is -1. If `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, `low` is 0 and `high` is `(n - 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `low` is `(n - 1) // 2` and `high` is `n - 1`. In both cases, `st` is a set containing `(n - 1) // 2` and `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is greater than 2, `k` is the second value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present, otherwise `pos` is -1, `mid` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `st` is a set containing `(n - 1) // 2` and `(n + 1) // 2`. If `arr[mid] > k`, then `low` is `(n - 1) // 2` and `high` is `(n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `low` is `(n + 1) // 2` and `high` is `((n - 1) // 2) + 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is greater than 2, `k` is the second value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present, otherwise `pos` is -1, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `st` is a set containing `(n - 1) // 2`, `(n + 1) // 2`, and `mid`, `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`. If `arr[mid] > k`, `low` is updated to `(n - 1) // 2` and `high` is updated to `mid`. Otherwise, `low` and `high` are both updated to `(n + 1) // 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
