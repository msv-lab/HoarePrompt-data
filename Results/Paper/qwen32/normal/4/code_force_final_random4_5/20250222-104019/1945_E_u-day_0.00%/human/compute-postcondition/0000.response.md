The code snippet assigns the values returned by `func_1()` to the variables `n` and `k`. The previous values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` are no longer relevant as they are being overwritten. The new values of `n` and `k` are dependent on the output of `func_1()`. Since the specific output of `func_1()` is not provided, we can only describe the state in terms of the new values assigned to `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is the first value returned by `func_1()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of length `n`.**
