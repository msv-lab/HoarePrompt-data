To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables. The loop iterates `n` times, and during each iteration, it checks if the current element of `arr` is equal to `k`. If it is, it updates the variable `pos` to the current index `i`. If not, `pos` remains unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the first value returned by `func_1()`
- `k` is the second value returned by `func_1()`
- `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`
- `pos` is initialized to -1

The loop will iterate `n` times. After all iterations, `pos` will either be the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or it will remain -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.

Thus, the final output state is:
- `n` remains the first value returned by `func_1()`
- `k` remains the second value returned by `func_1()`
- `arr` remains the list returned by `func_2()`
- `pos` will be the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present, otherwise `pos` will be -1

Output State: **`n` is the first value returned by `func_1()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, and `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present, otherwise `pos` is -1.**
