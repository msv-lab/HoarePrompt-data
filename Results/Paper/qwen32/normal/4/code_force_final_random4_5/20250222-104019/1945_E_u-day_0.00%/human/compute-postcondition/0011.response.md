The variable `pos` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `n` remains greater than `i + 2`. Since `i` was initially `i + 2`, after the assignment, `pos` will have the value `i + 2`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 2`; `i` is `i + 2`; `pos` is `i + 2`**.
