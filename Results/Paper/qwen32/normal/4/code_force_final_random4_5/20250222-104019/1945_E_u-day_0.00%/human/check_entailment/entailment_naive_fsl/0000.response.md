Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution as per the problem description. Specifically, it does not guarantee that after performing at most 2 swaps, the binary search will correctly identify the position of `x` such that `p_l` is equal to `x`.

Here are a few potential issues and counterexamples:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Swaps**: The code attempts to perform at most one swap if the binary search does not find `x` at the correct position. However, it does not consider the possibility of performing a second swap to correct the order.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic is flawed. The code only performs a single swap if the initial binary search does not find `x` at the correct position. It does not ensure that after the swap, the binary search will find `x` at the correct position.

3. **Counterexample**: Consider the following test case:
    ```
    1
    5 3
    5 4 3 2 1
    ```
    - The initial binary search will not find `3` at the correct position because the array is sorted in descending order.
    - The code will perform a single swap, but it may not be sufficient to place `3` in the correct position for the binary search to find it.

Let's consider a specific case:
- For the input `n = 5`, `x = 3` and the permutation `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`, the binary search will start with `l = 0` and `r = 5`.
- The first iteration will set `m = 2` and find `arr[2] = 3`, but the binary search will not terminate correctly because the array is not sorted.
- The code will perform a swap, but it may not place `3` in the correct position for the binary search to find it.

Therefore, the code does not correctly implement the solution as per the problem description, and there are potential cases where the program does not work as expected. Hence, the correctness is **False**.
