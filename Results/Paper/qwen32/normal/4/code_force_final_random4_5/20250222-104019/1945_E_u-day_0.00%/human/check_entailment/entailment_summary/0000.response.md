### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided functions and their behavior to ensure they meet the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and returns them as a map object.
   - It is used to read the values of `n` and `x` for each test case, and also to read the permutation list.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function takes the output from `func_1` and converts it into a list.
   - It is used to convert the permutation list from a map object to a list for easier manipulation.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function is the main logic of the program.
   - It first reads `n` and `x` using `func_1`.
   - It then reads the permutation list `arr` using `func_2`.
   - It finds the position of `x` in the permutation list.
   - It performs a binary search to find a lower bound index `low` where the binary search would stop.
   - If `arr[low]` is equal to `x`, it prints `0` indicating no swaps are needed.
   - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `x`, it prints `1` and the 1-based indices of `low` and the position of `x` in the list, indicating one swap is needed to bring `x` to the correct position.

### Analysis of Correctness:
- The problem requires us to perform up to 2 swaps to ensure that after a binary search, the element at the position `l` is equal to `x`.
- `func_3` correctly identifies the position of `x` and the position where the binary search would stop (`low`).
- If `arr[low]` is not equal to `x`, it suggests a single swap to bring `x` to the correct position, which is within the limit of 2 swaps required by the problem.
- However, `func_3` does not handle the scenario where a second swap might be necessary. For example, if the binary search stops at an element less than `x` and the element at `low` is not `x`, we might need to swap `x` with an element at `high` or another strategic position to ensure the binary search stops at `x`.

### Conclusion:
While `func_3` handles the case where a single swap is sufficient, it does not account for the possibility of needing a second swap. Therefore, the program does not guarantee that it will always find the correct position of `x` after performing at most 2 swaps for all possible permutations.

**Correctness: False**
