To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `low + 1 < high`. The variables `low` and `high` are the only ones that can be adjusted according to the loop head.

Given:
- `low` is initialized to 0.
- `high` is initialized to `n - 1`.

For the loop to execute, the condition `low + 1 < high` must be true. Let's analyze this:

1. **Initial Values**: We have `low = 0` and `high = n - 1`.
2. **Condition**: `low + 1 < high` translates to `0 + 1 < n - 1`, which simplifies to `1 < n - 1` or `2 < n`.

Thus, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 2. If `n` is 2 or less, the condition `low + 1 < high` will not be satisfied, and the loop will not execute.

No other variables in the loop condition need adjustment. The state of `n` is the only thing that needs to be ensured for the loop to run.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `k` is the second value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present, otherwise `pos` is -1; `low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, and `st` is an empty set.**
