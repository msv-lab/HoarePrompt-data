Let's systematically evaluate the provided program and its annotated version to determine if it correctly implements the solution as per the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to rearrange a permutation `p` such that after performing at most 2 swaps, a binary search can find the element `x` at the correct position `p_l`. The binary search is applied to the permutation, and the goal is to ensure that `p_l` equals `x` after the search.

### Program Analysis
The provided program includes three functions:
1. `func_1`: Reads a line of input and returns a map of integers.
2. `func_2`: Converts the map of integers from `func_1` into a list.
3. `func_3`: Contains the main logic for each test case.

#### Function `func_3` Detailed Analysis
1. **Reading Input:**
   - `n, k = func_1()`: Reads the size of the permutation `n` and the target element `k`.
   - `arr = func_2()`: Reads the permutation array `arr`.

2. **Finding the Position of `k`:**
   - `pos = -1`: Initializes the position of `k` to -1.
   - Loops through the array to find the index `i` where `arr[i] == k` and sets `pos = i`.

3. **Binary Search Execution:**
   - Initializes `low = 0` and `high = n - 1`.
   - Uses a set `st` to store midpoints during the binary search.
   - Executes the binary search loop until `low + 1 < high`:
     - Calculates `mid = (low + high) // 2`.
     - Adds `mid` to the set `st`.
     - Adjusts `low` or `high` based on the comparison between `arr[mid]` and `k`.

4. **Output:**
   - If `arr[low] == k`, prints `0` (no swaps needed).
   - Otherwise, prints `1` and the indices to swap (`low + 1` and `pos + 1`).

### Issues with the Program
1. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The binary search logic in the program is flawed because it does not guarantee that after performing a swap, the binary search will correctly identify the position of `x`. The binary search assumes the array is sorted, which it is not.

2. **Handling Swaps:**
   - The program only considers performing a single swap to correct the order, which is insufficient for all cases. The problem states that up to 2 swaps are allowed, but the program does not utilize this flexibility.

3. **Counterexample:**
   - Consider the permutation `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` with `x = 3`.
   - The initial binary search will not find `3` at the correct position because the array is sorted in descending order.
   - The program will perform a single swap, but it may not be sufficient to place `3` in the correct position for the binary search to find it.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution as per the problem description. It does not ensure that after performing at most 2 swaps, the binary search will correctly identify the position of `x` such that `p_l` is equal to `x`. The binary search logic and the handling of swaps are insufficient for all cases.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
