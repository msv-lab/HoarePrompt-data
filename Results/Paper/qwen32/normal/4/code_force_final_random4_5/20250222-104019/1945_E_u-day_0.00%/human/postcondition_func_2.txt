The function determines the position of a specified integer `k` in a permutation list `arr` of length `n`. It prints `0` if `k` is found at the position indicated by a binary search's lower bound index. If `k` is not found at that position, it prints `1` followed by the 1-based indices of the lower bound and the first occurrence of `k` in the list.
