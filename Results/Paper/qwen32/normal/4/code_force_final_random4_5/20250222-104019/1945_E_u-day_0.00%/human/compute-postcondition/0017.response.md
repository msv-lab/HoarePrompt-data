The code calculates the middle index `mid` of the range defined by `low` and `high`. Given that `low` is 0 and `high` is `n - 1`, `mid` will be `(0 + (n - 1)) // 2`, which simplifies to `(n - 1) // 2`.

The values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, and `st` remain unchanged except for the introduction of `mid`. Therefore, the Output State will include the new value of `mid` and retain all other variables as they were initially described.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `k` is the second value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present, otherwise `pos` is -1; `low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, and `st` is an empty set; `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`.**
