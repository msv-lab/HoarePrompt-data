Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `max_item_idx` is the largest index `i` in the range 1 to n-1 for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns '<', or 0 if `func_1` never returns '<'; `pair_idx` is equal to `max_item_idx`.**

In simple terms, the value of `pair_idx` has been set to the value of `max_item_idx`. All other variables and their conditions remain the same.
