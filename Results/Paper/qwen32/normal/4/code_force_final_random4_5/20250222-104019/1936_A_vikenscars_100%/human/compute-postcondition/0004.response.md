Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `max_item_idx` is 1, `i` is 1, `ans` is the return value of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`, and `ans` equals '<'**

Explanation: The only variable that has been changed is `max_item_idx`, which is now set to the value of `i`, which is 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
