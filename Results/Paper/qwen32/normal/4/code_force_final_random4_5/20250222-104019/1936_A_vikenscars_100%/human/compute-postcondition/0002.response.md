To determine the output state, we need to understand how the function `func_1` affects the variables. However, the definition of `func_1` is not provided. Therefore, we can only assume that `func_1` returns some value based on its parameters, and it does not modify the global variables `n`, `max_item_idx`, or `i` directly unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the only variable that is affected is `ans`, which is assigned the return value of `func_1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `max_item_idx` is 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is the return value of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`**.
