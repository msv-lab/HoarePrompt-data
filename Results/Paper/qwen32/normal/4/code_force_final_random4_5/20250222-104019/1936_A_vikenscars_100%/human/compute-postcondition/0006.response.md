The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

From the provided information:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- The loop runs from `i` in the range `[1, n)`, meaning it will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it defines the upper limit of the loop.

The variables `max_item_idx` and `ans` are not part of the loop head and therefore should not be adjusted based on the loop's iteration logic. They are computed based on the function `func_1` and the current values of `max_item_idx` and `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `max_item_idx` is 1 if `ans` equals '<', otherwise `max_item_idx` remains 0, `i` is 2, and `ans` is the return value of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`**
