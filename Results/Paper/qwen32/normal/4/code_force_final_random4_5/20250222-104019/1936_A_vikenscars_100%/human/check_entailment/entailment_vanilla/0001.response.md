Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
The goal is to find a pair of indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that the bitwise XOR of \( p_i \) and \( p_j \) is maximized, using at most \( 3n \) queries. The queries can compare the bitwise OR of two pairs of elements in the permutation.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Finding the Maximum Element in the Permutation:**
   - The first loop in `func_2` (`for i in range(1, n):`) aims to find the maximum element in the permutation. It does this by comparing the bitwise OR of the current maximum element (`max_item_idx`) with each other element in the permutation.
   - The query is of the form `? max_item_idx max_item_idx i i`. This query is intended to compare the bitwise OR of the maximum element with itself (`p_max_item_idx | p_max_item_idx`) against the bitwise OR of the current element with itself (`p_i | p_i`).
   - Since `p_i | p_i` is always equal to `p_i` (bitwise OR of a number with itself is the number itself), this query is actually comparing `p_max_item_idx` with `p_i`. If `p_i` is greater, `max_item_idx` is updated to `i`.
   - This is a correct approach to find the maximum element in the permutation.

2. **Finding the Pair with the Maximum XOR:**
   - After finding the maximum element (`max_item_idx`), the second loop (`for i in range(n):`) aims to find a pair `(max_item_idx, pair_idx)` such that the XOR of the two elements is maximized.
   - The query is of the form `? max_item_idx pair_idx max_item_idx i`. This query compares the bitwise OR of the maximum element with the current `pair_idx` (`p_max_item_idx | p_pair_idx`) against the bitwise OR of the maximum element with the current element (`p_max_item_idx | p_i`).
   - If the result is `<`, it means `p_max_item_idx | p_i` is greater, so `pair_idx` is updated to `i`.
   - If the result is `=`, it means `p_max_item_idx | p_i` is equal to `p_max_item_idx | p_pair_idx`. The program then makes another query `? pair_idx pair_idx i i` to compare `p_pair_idx` with `p_i`.
   - If the result of this second query is `>`, it means `p_pair_idx` is greater than `p_i`, so `pair_idx` is updated to `i`.
   - This approach is intended to find a pair where the XOR is maximized, but it is flawed.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program uses the bitwise OR operation to infer information about the bitwise XOR operation. However, the bitwise OR operation does not directly provide information about the XOR operation in a way that guarantees finding the maximum XOR pair.
- The logic for updating `pair_idx` based on the results of the queries is not sufficient to ensure that the maximum XOR pair is found. It relies on the assumption that the maximum element paired with another large element will yield the maximum XOR, which is not necessarily true.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not guarantee finding the pair of indices with the maximum XOR value using the queries provided. The logic for inferring the maximum XOR pair from the bitwise OR comparisons is flawed.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
