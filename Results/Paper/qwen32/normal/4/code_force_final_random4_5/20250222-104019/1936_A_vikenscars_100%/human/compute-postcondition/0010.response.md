The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is in the range from 1 to `n-1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. The variable `n` does not need to be adjusted because it defines the upper limit of the loop and has already been established as an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4.

The values of `max_item_idx` and `ans` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted based on the loop iteration alone. However, for the sake of completeness in understanding the state, we note that `max_item_idx` remains 2 if `ans` equals '<', otherwise it remains 0, and `ans` is the return value of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `max_item_idx` is 2 if `ans` equals '<', otherwise `max_item_idx` remains 0, `i` is 3, and `ans` is the return value of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`**
