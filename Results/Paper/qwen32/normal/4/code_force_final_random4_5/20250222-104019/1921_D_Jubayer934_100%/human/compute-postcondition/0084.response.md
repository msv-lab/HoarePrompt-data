The code snippet `temp = i` assigns the value of `i` to `temp`. Given that `i` is 2, `temp` will also be 2. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `ans`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` (now includes the new value `abs(a[i] - b[i])`), `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the new input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the new input, sorted in descending order, `i` is 2**
