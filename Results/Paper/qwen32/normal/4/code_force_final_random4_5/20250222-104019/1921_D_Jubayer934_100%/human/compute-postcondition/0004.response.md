The code snippet takes a sorted list of integers from the input, up to the first integer `n`. This means that `a` will be a list of the first `n` integers from the input, sorted in ascending order. The values of `t`, `m`, `temp`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is -1, `ans` is an empty list, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input.**
