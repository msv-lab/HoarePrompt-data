The given code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` to the list `ans`. Here's the output state after the execution of the code:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than `temp`, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is the index `i` where the loop broke and is not -1 and must be less than `n`, `ans` is a list of `min(n, i+2)` absolute differences, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.**

Explanation: The list `ans` now includes one additional element, which is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`. Therefore, the length of `ans` is now `min(n, i+2)` instead of `min(n, i+1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
