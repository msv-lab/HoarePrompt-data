The code snippet appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. This affects the `ans` list by adding a new element to it. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `temp` remain unchanged unless `temp` is set to `i` and the loop is broken in the conditional statement (which is not part of the given code snippet).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `ans` is a list containing the value `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and the newly appended value `abs(a[i] - b[i])`, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the new input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `i + 1`. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `temp` is set to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `temp` remains -1.**
