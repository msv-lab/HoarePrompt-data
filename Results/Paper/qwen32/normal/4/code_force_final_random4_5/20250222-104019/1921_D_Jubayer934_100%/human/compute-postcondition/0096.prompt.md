Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is the index `i` where a certain condition was first met (and is not -1), `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences calculated up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all `n` iterations, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the new input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the new input, sorted in descending order.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(temp, n):
    ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is an integer such that 0 <= temp < n, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences calculated up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all `n` iterations, including the new value `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the new input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the new input, sorted in descending order.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is an integer such that 0 <= temp < n, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences calculated up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all `n` iterations, including the new value `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the new input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the new input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `temp + 1`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is an integer such that 0 <= temp < n and `temp` is now `temp + 1`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences calculated up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all `n` iterations, including the new value `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the new input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the new input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `temp + 2`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
