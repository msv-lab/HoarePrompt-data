To determine what will be printed when the `print(sum(ans))` statement executes, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the conditions given.

### Initial State and Conditions:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
2. `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
3. `temp` remains unchanged.
4. `a` is a sorted list.
5. `b` is a sorted list in descending order.
6. If `temp` is not -1, `ans` will have `n - temp` additional elements, each being `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for `i` ranging from `temp` to `n-1`.
7. If `temp` is -1, `ans` remains unchanged.

### Analysis:
- The list `ans` is derived based on the value of `temp`.
- If `temp` is -1, `ans` remains unchanged, and we do not have additional information about the initial elements of `ans`. Therefore, the sum of `ans` will be the sum of whatever elements were originally in `ans`.
- If `temp` is not -1, `ans` will have additional elements calculated as `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for `i` ranging from `temp` to `n-1`.

### Output Calculation:
- **If `temp` is -1**: The output will be the sum of the elements in the original `ans` list.
- **If `temp` is not -1**: The output will be the sum of the original `ans` list plus the sum of the newly added elements `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for `i` ranging from `temp` to `n-1`.

Given that we don't have the initial values of `ans`, `a`, `b`, `temp`, `n`, and `m`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:
If `temp` is -1, the output is the sum of the original `ans` list.
If `temp` is not -1, the output is the sum of the original `ans` list plus the sum of the newly added elements `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for `i` ranging from `temp` to `n-1`.

Thus, the most precise description possible based on the given information is:
Output: **sum(ans) (where ans is the list of original elements plus additional elements abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) for i ranging from temp to n-1 if temp is not -1, otherwise sum(ans) is the sum of the original elements of ans)**
