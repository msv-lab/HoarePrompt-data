Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5. a_i is a list of n integers where each a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. b_i is a list of m integers where each b_i satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^9. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    temp = -1
    ans = []
    a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))[:n]
    b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]
    for i in range(n):
        if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):
            temp = i
            break
        ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))
    if temp != -1:
        for i in range(temp, n):
            ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))
    print(sum(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is either -1 or the index `i` where the loop broke, `ans` is a list of `min(n, i+1)` absolute differences, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input, and `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order. If `temp` is not -1, then `temp` is the index `i` where the loop broke, `n` is greater than `temp`, and `ans` is a list of `n` absolute differences. If `temp` is -1, then no specific changes are made to `n` or `ans` beyond their initial definitions.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the number of elements in list `a`, `m` is the number of elements in list `b`, `temp` is an index such that 0 <= temp <= n (if a break occurred, `temp` is the index where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` was met, otherwise `temp` is -1), `ans` is a list containing the values `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for `i` from 0 to `temp-1`, and if a break occurred, it also includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for `i` from `temp` to `n-1`, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the new input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `temp` remains unchanged, `a` remains sorted, and `b` remains sorted in descending order. If `temp` is not -1, `ans` will have `n - temp` additional elements, each being `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for `i` ranging from `temp` to `n-1`. If `temp` is -1, `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
