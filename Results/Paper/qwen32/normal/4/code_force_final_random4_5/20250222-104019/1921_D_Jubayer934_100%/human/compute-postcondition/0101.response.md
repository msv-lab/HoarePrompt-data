Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two lists of integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates a series of absolute differences between elements of the two lists and outputs the sum of these differences. The differences are calculated in a specific way: for each element in `a`, it compares the absolute difference with the corresponding element in the front of `b` versus the corresponding element in the back of `b`, and chooses the smaller one until a larger difference is found, after which it switches to choosing from the back of `b`.**
