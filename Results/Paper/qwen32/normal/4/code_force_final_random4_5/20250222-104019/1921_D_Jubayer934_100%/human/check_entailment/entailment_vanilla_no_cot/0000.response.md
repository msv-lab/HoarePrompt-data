Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum total difference \( D \). The logic for selecting elements from array \( b \) to maximize the difference is flawed. 

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. The program sorts array \( a \) in ascending order and array \( b \) in descending order.
2. It then iteratively tries to select elements from the largest and smallest ends of \( b \) to maximize the difference for each element in \( a \).
3. However, the logic for breaking the loop and selecting elements from the opposite ends of \( b \) is incorrect. It only breaks the loop if it finds a single element where the difference is maximized by choosing from the opposite end, but it doesn't guarantee that this strategy will maximize the total difference for all elements.
4. Instead of breaking the loop after finding the first such element, Vasya should always try to maximize the difference for each element in \( a \) by choosing the best element from \( b \).

A correct approach would be to use a two-pointer technique or a greedy approach to always select the best possible element from \( b \) to maximize the difference for each element in \( a \).

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        b = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Use two pointers to maximize the difference
        i, j = 0, m - 1
        ans = 0
        for _ in range(n):
            if i <= j and (j == m - 1 or a[i] - b[i] >= b[j] - a[i]):
                ans += abs(a[i] - b[i])
                i += 1
            else:
                ans += abs(a[i] - b[j])
                j -= 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that for each element in \( a \), the best possible element from \( b \) is chosen to maximize the total difference \( D \).
