The code snippet provided updates the values of `n` and `m` by reading two integers from the input. The initial state of `n` and `m` is that they are the first and second integers from the input, respectively. After the execution of the code, `n` and `m` will be reassigned to the new values obtained from the input, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `temp` is either -1 or the index `i` where the loop broke, `ans` is a list of `min(n, i+1)` absolute differences, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input, and `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.**
