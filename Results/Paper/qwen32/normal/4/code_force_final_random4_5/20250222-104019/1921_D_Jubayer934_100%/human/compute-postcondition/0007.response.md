Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is -1, `ans` is an empty list, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order. The absolute difference between `a[i]` and the element at the position `-(n - i)` in `b` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and the element at the position `i` in `b`.**
