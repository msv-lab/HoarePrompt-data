You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = str(input())
    b = str(input())
    i = 0
    j = 0
    c = 0
    while j < m and i < n:
        new_j = func_1(a, b, i, j)
        if new_j != -1:
            j = new_j + 1
            i += 1
            c += 1
        else:
            break
    print(c)

def func_1(a, b, i, j):
    index = b[j:].find(a[i])
    if index != -1:
        return j + index
    else:
        return -1



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts two binary strings `a` and `b`, and two non-negative integers `i` and `j`. It returns the position of the first occurrence of the character `a[i]` in the string `b`, starting from index `j`. If `a[i]` is not found in `b` starting from index `j`, it returns -1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze the logic step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to find the maximum length of a prefix of string `a` that is a subsequence of string `b`. A subsequence means that the characters of the prefix can appear in `b` in the same order but not necessarily consecutively.

### Program Analysis

The program follows a two-pointer technique to solve the problem efficiently:
1. `i` is the pointer for string `a`.
2. `j` is the pointer for string `b`.
3. `c` is a counter to keep track of the length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

The main loop continues until either `i` reaches the end of `a` or `j` reaches the end of `b`. Inside the loop:
- `func_1` is called to find the next occurrence of `a[i]` in `b` starting from `j`.
- If `func_1` returns a valid index, it means `a[i]` can be matched with a character in `b` starting from `j`. We then move `j` to the position after the matched character, increment `i` to move to the next character in `a`, and increment `c` to count the matched character.
- If `func_1` returns `-1`, it means no more characters of `a` can be matched with `b` starting from `j`, so we break out of the loop.

### Function `func_1`

The function `func_1` uses the `find` method to locate the next occurrence of `a[i]` in the substring of `b` starting from `j`. If found, it returns the index adjusted by `j`; otherwise, it returns `-1`.

### Correctness Check

Let's verify if this approach correctly solves the problem:
- The two-pointer technique ensures that we are efficiently finding the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
- The `find` method correctly identifies the next occurrence of the character, and the adjustments to `i`, `j`, and `c` are correct.
- The loop terminates appropriately when no more characters can be matched.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum length of a prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
