The code snippet `s_a += nums[i]` increments the variable `s_a` by the value of `nums[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged unless directly affected by this operation.

Given that `s_a` is initially `nums[i] + nums[i]` (which simplifies to `2 * nums[i]`), after the operation `s_a` becomes `2 * nums[i] + nums[i]`, which simplifies to `3 * nums[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 1; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `k` is less than the sum of `nums`; `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`; `b` is `k // 2`; `s_a` is `3 * nums[i]`; `s_b` is `s_b + nums[n - i - 1]`; `i` is `i + 1`; If `s_a` is less than or equal to `a`, `ans` is incremented by 1. Additionally, if `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`, `ans` is incremented by 1.**
