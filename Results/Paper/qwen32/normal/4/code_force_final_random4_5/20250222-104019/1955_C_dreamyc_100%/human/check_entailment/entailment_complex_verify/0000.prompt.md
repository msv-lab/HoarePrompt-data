You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. Here, `n` is the number of elements in the list `nums`, `k` is an integer, and `nums` is a list of integers. If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in `nums`, the function returns `n`. Otherwise, it calculates the number of times the cumulative sum of elements from the start and from the end of `nums` are less than or equal to `ceil(k/2)` and `k//2`, respectively, and returns this count.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attack pattern. The code attempts to use a mathematical approach to determine how many ships are sunk, but it does not accurately reflect the alternating attack pattern (first ship, last ship, first ship, etc.).

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Attacks**:
   - The code calculates `a` and `b` as the number of attacks on the first and last ships, respectively. However, it does not correctly account for the alternating pattern and the reduction in the number of ships as they sink.
   - The `s_a` and `s_b` variables are cumulative sums of the ships' durability, but they are not correctly used to determine when a ship sinks.

2. **Inaccurate Sinking Logic**:
   - The code checks if `s_a <= a` and `s_b <= b` to determine if a ship has sunk. This logic does not accurately simulate the Kraken's attack pattern because it does not account for the fact that once a ship sinks, it is no longer part of the list of ships that can be attacked.
   - The code does not update the list of ships or their durability as ships sink, which is crucial for accurately simulating the attack pattern.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The code does not handle cases where `k` is very large compared to the total durability of the ships. While the code correctly returns `n` if `k >= sum(nums)`, it does not handle the more complex scenarios where `k` is less than the total durability but the ships still sink in a specific order.

Here is a test case that demonstrates the issue:
```
Input:
1
4 5
1 2 4 3

Expected Output:
2

Actual Output (from the provided code):
4
```

In this test case, the Kraken attacks the ships in the following order:
1. Attacks the first ship (durability becomes 0, ship sinks), `a = [2, 4, 3]`
2. Attacks the last ship (durability becomes 2), `a = [2, 4, 2]`
3. Attacks the first ship (durability becomes 1), `a = [1, 4, 2]`
4. Attacks the last ship (durability becomes 1), `a = [1, 4, 1]`
5. Attacks the first ship (durability becomes 0, ship sinks), `a = [4, 1]`

The correct output is 2, but the provided code outputs 4, indicating that it incorrectly determines that all ships have sunk.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
