Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; Additionally, `k` is less than the sum of `nums`; `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`; `b` is `k // 2`; `ans` is 0; `s_a` is 0.**

In this output state, the variable `s_a` has been initialized to 0. All other variables retain their previously specified values and constraints.
