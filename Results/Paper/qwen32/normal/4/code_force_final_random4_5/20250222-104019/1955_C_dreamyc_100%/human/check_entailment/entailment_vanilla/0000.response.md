Let's analyze the provided Python program and see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis
The problem states that we need to determine how many ships will sink after the Kraken attacks them `k` times. The Kraken attacks the first ship, then the last ship, and alternates between the first and last until either all ships have sunk or `k` attacks have been made.

### Provided Program Analysis
The provided program uses a function `func_1` to calculate the number of ships that will sink. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic used in the program:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of ships) and `k` (number of attacks).
   - It also reads the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all ship durabilities (`sum(nums)`), it means all ships will sink, so it returns `n`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates `a` as the ceiling of `k/2` and `b` as `k//2`. This is because the Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ship, so approximately half the attacks will be on the first ship and the other half on the last ship.
   - It then iterates through the list of ships, maintaining two cumulative sums: `s_a` for the first `i+1` ships and `s_b` for the last `i+1` ships.
   - If `s_a` (cumulative sum of the first `i+1` ships) is less than or equal to `a`, it increments the count of sunk ships (`ans`).
   - Similarly, if `s_b` (cumulative sum of the last `i+1` ships) is less than or equal to `b`, it increments the count of sunk ships (`ans`).
   - Finally, it returns the count of sunk ships (`ans`).

### Issues with the Provided Program
The logic in the provided program is flawed. Here's why:

- The program incorrectly assumes that the number of attacks `k` can be evenly split between the first and last ships, which is not always the case, especially when `k` is odd.
- The program does not correctly account for the fact that once a ship sinks, it is no longer attacked. The cumulative sums `s_a` and `s_b` do not reflect this correctly.
- The logic for counting sunk ships is incorrect because it does not properly simulate the alternating attack pattern and the sinking of ships.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the attack pattern and keep track of which ships have sunk. Here's a correct approach:

1. Initialize two pointers: one at the start (`left`) and one at the end (`right`) of the list of ship durabilities.
2. Initialize a counter for the number of attacks made.
3. Alternate between attacking the ship at the `left` pointer and the ship at the `right` pointer.
4. Decrease the durability of the attacked ship by 1.
5. If a ship's durability drops to 0, move the pointer to the next ship.
6. Stop when the number of attacks reaches `k` or all ships have sunk.
7. Count and return the number of ships that have sunk.

### Conclusion
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly simulate the attack pattern and the sinking of ships. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
