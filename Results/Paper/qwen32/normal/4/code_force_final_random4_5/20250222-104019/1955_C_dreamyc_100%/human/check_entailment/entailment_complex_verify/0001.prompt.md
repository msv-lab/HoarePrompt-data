You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. Here, `n` is the number of elements in the list `nums`, `k` is an integer, and `nums` is a list of integers. If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in `nums`, the function returns `n`. Otherwise, it calculates the number of times the cumulative sum of elements from the start and from the end of `nums` are less than or equal to `ceil(k/2)` and `k//2`, respectively, and returns this count.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program and see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis
The problem states that we need to determine how many ships will sink after the Kraken attacks them `k` times. The Kraken attacks the first ship, then the last ship, and alternates between the first and last until either all ships have sunk or `k` attacks have been made.

### Provided Program Analysis
The provided program uses a function `func_1` to calculate the number of ships that will sink. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic used in the program:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of ships) and `k` (number of attacks).
   - It also reads the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all ship durabilities (`sum(nums)`), it means all ships will sink, so it returns `n`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates `a` as the ceiling of `k/2` and `b` as `k//2`. This is because the Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ship, so approximately half the attacks will be on the first ship and the other half on the last ship.
   - It then iterates through the list of ships, maintaining two cumulative sums: `s_a` for the first `i+1` ships and `s_b` for the last `i+1` ships.
   - If `s_a` (cumulative sum of the first `i+1` ships) is less than or equal to `a`, it increments the count of sunk ships (`ans`).
   - Similarly, if `s_b` (cumulative sum of the last `i+1` ships) is less than or equal to `b`, it increments the count of sunk ships (`ans`).
   - Finally, it returns the count of sunk ships (`ans`).

### Issues with the Provided Program
The logic in the provided program is flawed. Here's why:

- The program incorrectly assumes that the number of attacks `k` can be evenly split between the first and last ships, which is not always the case, especially when `k` is odd.
- The program does not correctly account for the fact that once a ship sinks, it is no longer attacked. The cumulative sums `s_a` and `s_b` do not reflect this correctly.
- The logic for counting sunk ships is incorrect because it does not properly simulate the alternating attack pattern and the sinking of ships.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the attack pattern and keep track of which ships have sunk. Here's a correct approach:

1. Initialize two pointers: one at the start (`left`) and one at the end (`right`) of the list of ship durabilities.
2. Initialize a counter for the number of attacks made.
3. Alternate between attacking the ship at the `left` pointer and the ship at the `right` pointer.
4. Decrease the durability of the attacked ship by 1.
5. If a ship's durability drops to 0, move the pointer to the next ship.
6. Stop when the number of attacks reaches `k` or all ships have sunk.
7. Count and return the number of ships that have sunk.

### Conclusion
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly simulate the attack pattern and the sinking of ships. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
