### Reasoning:

The original assessment appears to be accurate, and the provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs sequentially according to its periodicity.

Let's break down the code and the logic again to ensure there are no issues:

1. **Initialization**: The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0. This makes sense because we start checking from year 0.

2. **Loop through each sign**: For each sign, the code calculates the next occurrence year:
   ```python
   start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
   ```
   - `(start_year + 1) // nums[x]` calculates the largest integer `k` such that `k * nums[x] <= start_year + 1`.
   - Adding 1 to this result ensures we are looking for the next multiple of `nums[x]`.
   - Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the exact year that is the next multiple of `nums[x]` after `start_year`.

3. **Output**: The final `start_year` after processing all signs is printed, which correctly represents the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's verify the first test case in the example again:
- `n = 6`
- `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
- Iteration 1: `start_year = 0`, next occurrence of 3 is `3`.
- Iteration 2: `start_year = 3`, next occurrence of 2 after 3 is `4`.
- Iteration 3: `start_year = 4`, next occurrence of 4 after 4 is `8`.
- Iteration 4: `start_year = 8`, next occurrence of 5 after 8 is `10`.
- Iteration 5: `start_year = 10`, next occurrence of 9 after 10 is `18`.
- Iteration 6: `start_year = 18`, next occurrence of 18 after 18 is `36`.

The code correctly calculates the year for the n-th sign to occur as `36`.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs sequentially according to its periodicity. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
