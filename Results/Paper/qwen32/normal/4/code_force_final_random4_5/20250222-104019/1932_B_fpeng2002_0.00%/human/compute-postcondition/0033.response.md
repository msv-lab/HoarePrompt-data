To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and how it affects the variables:

Initial State: 
- `start_year` is 0
- `num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`
- `n` is an input integer
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element
- `x` is 0

The code snippet:
```
start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
```

Given that `start_year` is 0 and `x` is 0, we substitute these values into the expression:
- `start_year + 1` becomes `0 + 1` which is `1`
- `nums[x]` is `nums[0]`, which is the first element of the list `nums`
- `(start_year + 1) // nums[x]` becomes `1 // nums[0]`, which is integer division of 1 by the first element of `nums`
- `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1)` becomes `(1 // nums[0] + 1)`
- `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` becomes `(1 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`

Let's denote the first element of `nums` as `nums[0] = first_num`. The expression then simplifies to:
- `start_year = (1 // first_num + 1) * first_num`

If `first_num` is 1, then:
- `1 // 1` is `1`
- `1 + 1` is `2`
- `2 * 1` is `2`

If `first_num` is greater than 1, then:
- `1 // first_num` is `0` (since integer division of 1 by any number greater than 1 is 0)
- `0 + 1` is `1`
- `1 * first_num` is `first_num`

So, `start_year` will be `first_num`.

Output State: **`start_year` is `nums[0]`, `num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `x` is 0**.
