To determine what the `print(start_year)` statement will output, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state:

1. **`start_year`**: This variable is described as the value computed after processing all elements in the `nums` list according to a given formula. However, the specific formula is not provided, so we can only describe `start_year` based on this information.
2. **`num_tests`**: It is mentioned that `num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1. This information does not affect the value of `start_year`.
3. **`n`**: This is an input integer. It is not directly related to the computation of `start_year`.
4. **`nums`**: This is a list of integers. The computation of `start_year` depends on this list.
5. **`x`**: This is the last index of the `nums` list. It is not directly related to the computation of `start_year`.

Given this information, we can only describe `start_year` as the result of some computation involving the `nums` list. Since the specific computation is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `start_year`. However, we can describe it precisely based on the given information.

Output: **start_year (where start_year is the value computed after processing all elements in the `nums` list according to the given formula)**
