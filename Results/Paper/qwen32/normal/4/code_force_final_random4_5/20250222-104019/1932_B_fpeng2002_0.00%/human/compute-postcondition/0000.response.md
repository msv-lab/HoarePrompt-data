Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer representing the number of test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs.**

In simpler terms, `num_tests` has been assigned the value of the first input integer, which indicates how many test cases will follow. The details of each test case (the number of signs and their periodicities) remain as described in the initial state.
