The code snippet sets `start_year` to 0. None of the other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, and `x`) are affected by this assignment. Therefore, their values remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`start_year` is 0, `num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.**
