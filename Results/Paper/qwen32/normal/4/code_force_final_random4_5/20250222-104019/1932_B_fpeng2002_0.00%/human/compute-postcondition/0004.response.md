The code reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `nums`. The values of `num_tests` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
