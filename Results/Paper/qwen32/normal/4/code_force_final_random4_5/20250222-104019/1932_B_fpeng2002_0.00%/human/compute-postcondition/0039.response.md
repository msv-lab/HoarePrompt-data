To determine the output of the `print(start_year)` statement, we need to understand the context and the transformations applied to `start_year` based on the given initial state.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **`start_year`**: This variable is described as the result of the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums) - 1] + 1) * nums[len(nums) - 1]` after all iterations. This formula suggests that `start_year` is being adjusted based on the last element of the `nums` list.
   
2. **`num_tests`**: This variable is `num_tests - 1`, but it is not directly used in the `print(start_year)` statement, so we can ignore it for the purpose of determining the output of `start_year`.

3. **`n`**: This is an input integer, but it is not directly used in the formula for `start_year`, so we can ignore it for the purpose of determining the output of `start_year`.

4. **`nums`**: This is a list of integers obtained from the input. The formula for `start_year` uses `nums[len(nums) - 1]`, which is the last element of the list `nums`.

5. **`x`**: This variable is `len(nums) - 1`, which is the index of the last element of the list `nums`. This is used in the formula for `start_year`.

### Formula Analysis:

The formula for `start_year` is:
\[ \text{start\_year} = \left(\left(\text{start\_year} + 1\right) // \text{nums}[\text{len}(\text{nums}) - 1] + 1\right) * \text{nums}[\text{len}(\text{nums}) - 1] \]

Let's break down what this formula does:
- `nums[len(nums) - 1]` is the last element of the `nums` list.
- `(start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums) - 1]` performs integer division of `start_year + 1` by the last element of `nums`.
- Adding `1` to the result of the integer division shifts the result up by one.
- Multiplying by `nums[len(nums) - 1]` scales the result back to the nearest multiple of the last element of `nums`.

### Interpretation:

This formula essentially rounds `start_year` up to the next multiple of the last element of `nums`. After all iterations, `start_year` will be the smallest multiple of `nums[len(nums) - 1]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year + 1`.

### Output:

Given the initial state and the formula, the output of the `print(start_year)` statement will be the value of `start_year` after it has been adjusted to the nearest multiple of the last element of the `nums` list, as described by the formula.

Output: **start_year (where start_year is the smallest multiple of nums[len(nums) - 1] that is greater than or equal to start_year + 1)**
