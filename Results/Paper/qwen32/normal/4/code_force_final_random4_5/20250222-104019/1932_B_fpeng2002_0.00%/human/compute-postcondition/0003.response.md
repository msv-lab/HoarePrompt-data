The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `num_tests` is initially greater than 0 and is then decreased by 1. Therefore, `num_tests` is now one less than its initial value. The output state reflects these changes.

Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1; `n` is an input integer.**
