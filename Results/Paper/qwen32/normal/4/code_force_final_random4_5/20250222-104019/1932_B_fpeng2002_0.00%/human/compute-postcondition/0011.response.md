The code snippet updates the value of `start_year` by recalculating it with the new formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. Given that `x` is 2, the new `start_year` will be calculated using `nums[2]`.

Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]`, `x` is 2**.
