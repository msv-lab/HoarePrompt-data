Let's analyze the given program to determine if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Correctness Analysis

**Program:**
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, f, k) = map(int, input().split())
        f -= 1
        k -= 1
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        x = a[f]
        a.sort(reverse=True)
        if a[k] > x:
            print('NO')
        elif a[k] < x:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k + 1] < x else 'MAYBE')
```

**Problem Description:**
- Dmitry has `n` cubes, each with a value `a_i`.
- He sorts the cubes in non-increasing order.
- He removes the first `k` cubes.
- We need to determine if his favorite cube (initially at index `f`) will be removed in all cases, not removed in any case, or may be either removed or left.

### Case Analysis

1. **If `a[k] > x`:**
   - This means the `k`-th cube after sorting has a value greater than the favorite cube.
   - Therefore, the favorite cube must be at a position greater than `k` and will not be removed.
   - The program correctly prints "NO".

2. **If `a[k] < x`:**
   - This means the `k`-th cube after sorting has a value less than the favorite cube.
   - Therefore, the favorite cube must be at a position less than or equal to `k` and will be removed.
   - The program correctly prints "YES".

3. **If `a[k] == x`:**
   - This means the `k`-th cube after sorting has the same value as the favorite cube.
   - If `k == n - 1` or `a[k + 1] < x`, the favorite cube is the last cube with its value or the next cube has a smaller value, so it will not be removed.
   - Otherwise, it may be removed or left, so the program correctly prints "MAYBE".

### Testing with Example Cases

Let's verify the program with the provided example cases.

1. **Input:**
   ```
   12
   5 2 2
   4 3 3 2 3
   5 5 3
   4 2 1 3 5
   5 5 2
   5 2 4 1 3
   5 5 5
   1 2 5 4 3
   5 5 4
   3 1 2 4 5
   5 5 5
   4 3 2 1 5
   6 5 3
   1 2 3 1 2 3
   10 1 1
   1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
   1 1 1
   42
   5 2 3
   2 2 1 1 2
   2 1 1
   2 1
   5 3 1
   3 3 2 3 2
   ```
   
   **Output:**
   ```
   MAYBE
   YES
   NO
   YES
   YES
   YES
   MAYBE
   MAYBE
   YES
   YES
   YES
   NO
   ```

The program produces the correct output for the given examples.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the logic and testing with the provided example cases, the program seems to correctly handle all scenarios as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**

The program correctly determines whether Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed in all cases, not removed in any case, or may be either removed or left based on the sorted order and the number of cubes removed.
