Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first input integer, `f` is the second input integer minus 1, `k` is the third input integer minus 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, and `x` is `a[f]`. If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, the condition is true; otherwise, the condition is false. The values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged.**
