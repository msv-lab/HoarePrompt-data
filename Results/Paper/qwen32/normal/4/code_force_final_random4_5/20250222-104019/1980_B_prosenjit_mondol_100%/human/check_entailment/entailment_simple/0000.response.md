### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine if Dmitry's favorite cube, which is initially at position `f` (1-based index), will be removed after sorting the cubes in non-increasing order and removing the first `k` cubes.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, the program reads `n`, `f`, and `k`, and then reads the list `a` of `n` integers.
2. **Adjust Indices**: Since Python uses 0-based indexing, the program adjusts `f` and `k` by subtracting 1.
3. **Store Favorite Cube Value**: The value of the favorite cube `x` is stored.
4. **Sorting**: The list `a` is sorted in descending order.
5. **Comparison**:
   - If the `k`-th element in the sorted list is greater than `x`, the favorite cube is not removed (`NO`).
   - If the `k`-th element in the sorted list is less than `x`, the favorite cube is removed (`YES`).
   - If the `k`-th element in the sorted list is equal to `x`, the program checks if there are any cubes with the same value after the `k`-th position. If there are no such cubes or if the cube at position `k+1` has a smaller value, the favorite cube can be removed (`YES`). Otherwise, it can either be removed or not (`MAYBE`).

The logic correctly handles all possible scenarios and provides the correct output based on the given conditions.
