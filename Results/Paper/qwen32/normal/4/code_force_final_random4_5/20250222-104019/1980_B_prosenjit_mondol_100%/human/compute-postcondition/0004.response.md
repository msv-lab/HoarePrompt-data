The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `f`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer, `f` is `f - 1`, `k` is `k - 1`, `a` is a list of integers read from input.**
