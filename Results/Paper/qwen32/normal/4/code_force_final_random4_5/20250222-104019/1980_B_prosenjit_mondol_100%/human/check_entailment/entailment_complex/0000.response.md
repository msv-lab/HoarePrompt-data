### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem as described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, and `k`, followed by the list of integers `a`.

2. **Adjusting Indices**:
   - The program adjusts the favorite cube index `f` and the removal index `k` by subtracting 1 from each. This is because Python uses 0-based indexing, while the problem description uses 1-based indexing.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The list `a` is sorted in non-increasing order (from largest to smallest).

4. **Comparison**:
   - The value of the favorite cube `x` (which was originally at index `f`) is compared with the value at the `k`-th position in the sorted list `a`.
   - Depending on the comparison:
     - If the `k`-th value in the sorted list is greater than `x`, it means the favorite cube cannot be among the first `k` cubes in the sorted list, so the output is "NO".
     - If the `k`-th value is less than `x`, it means the favorite cube could be among the first `k` cubes in the sorted list, so the output is "YES".
     - If the `k`-th value is equal to `x`, the program checks the next value in the sorted list:
       - If the next value is less than `x`, it means there are multiple cubes with the same value as `x`, and some of them might be among the first `k` cubes, so the output is "MAYBE".
       - If the next value is also `x` and `k` is the last index, it means all remaining cubes have the same value, and the favorite cube might or might not be removed, so the output is "MAYBE".

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints "NO", "YES", or "MAYBE" for each test case based on the comparison results.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine whether the favorite cube can be removed, based on the sorted values and the given conditions.

**Correctness: **True**
