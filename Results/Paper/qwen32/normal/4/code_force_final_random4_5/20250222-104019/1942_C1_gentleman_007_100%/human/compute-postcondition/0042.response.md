The code snippet appends `node` to the list `q`. This means that the list `q` will now contain `node` as its last element. The values of `ver`, `graph[ver]`, and `vis[node]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ver` is a node that has at least one neighbor in the graph, `graph[ver]` is a list containing at least one neighbor, `vis[node]` is `False`, and `q` now contains `node` as its last element.**
