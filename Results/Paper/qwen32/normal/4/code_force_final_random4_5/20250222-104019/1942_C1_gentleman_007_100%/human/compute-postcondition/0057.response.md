Functionality: **The function `func_25` performs a breadth-first traversal (BFS) starting from the given vertex `ver` in the graph represented by `graph`. It prints each vertex in the connected component of `ver` and marks them as visited in the `vis` list or dictionary. The function modifies `vis` in place to reflect which vertices have been visited.**
