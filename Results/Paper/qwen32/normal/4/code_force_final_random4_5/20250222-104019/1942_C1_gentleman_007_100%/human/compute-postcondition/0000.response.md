The code snippet creates a new deque object and assigns it to the variable `q`. This operation does not affect the values of `ver`, `graph`, or `vis`. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state except for the addition of the deque `q`.

Output State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary or adjacency list representing the graph where each key is a vertex and its value is a list of adjacent vertices, `vis` is a list or dictionary used to keep track of visited vertices where `vis[node]` is 1 if the node has been visited and 0 otherwise, `q` is a deque object.**
