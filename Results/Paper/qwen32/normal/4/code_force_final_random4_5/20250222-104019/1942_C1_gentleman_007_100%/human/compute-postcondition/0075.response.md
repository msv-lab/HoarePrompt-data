The value of `i` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`dp`, `j`) remain unchanged. Given that `i` was initially at least 2, after decrementing, `i` is now at least 1.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` contains the length of the LCS of the first `i` elements of `a` and the first `j` elements of `b`. `i` is at least 1, `j` is at least 2**.
