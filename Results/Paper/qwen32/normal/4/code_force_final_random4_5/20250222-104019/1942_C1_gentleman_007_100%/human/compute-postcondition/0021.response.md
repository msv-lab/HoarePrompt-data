The variable `ver` is assigned the value of the leftmost element in the queue `q`, which is then removed from `q`. The precondition that all neighbors of the previous `ver` will have been processed except for at least one unvisited neighbor, which will have been added to `q`, still holds true. The unvisited neighbors of the new `ver` will have been marked as visited in `vis`.

Output State: **`ver` is the leftmost element that was removed from `q`; all neighbors of the previous `ver` will have been processed except for at least one unvisited neighbor, which will have been added to `q`; each unvisited neighbor of the new `ver` will have been marked as visited in `vis`.**
