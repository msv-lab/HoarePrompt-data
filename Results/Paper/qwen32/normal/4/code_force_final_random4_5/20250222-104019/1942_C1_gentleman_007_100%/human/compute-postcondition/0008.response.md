Output State: **`ver` is a vertex that is a key in `graph` and `graph[ver]` is a list or set containing at least one neighbor. `node` is a vertex in `graph` such that `vis[node]` is `False`. `q` has `node` appended to it.**

Explanation: The value of `vis[node]` remains `False`. The list or set `q` now includes `node` as an additional element. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
