Based on the provided initial state, let's break down the output of the `print` statement.

- `ver` holds the value of the leftmost element that was removed from `q`. This means that `ver` is a specific node or value that was recently extracted from the queue `q`.
- `q` must contain at least one unvisited node unless it was initially of size 1 and that node was just removed. This indicates that `q` is a queue that holds nodes, and nodes are being processed one by one.
- `vis` is a list or some kind of data structure that marks nodes as visited by setting their value to `1`. However, the value of `vis` is not directly used in the `print` statement, so it does not affect the output of this particular `print` statement.

Given the `print` statement `print(ver, end=' ')`, the output will be the value of `ver` followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter).

Since we don't have the exact value of `ver`, we can describe the output in terms of `ver`:

Output: **ver (where ver is the value of the leftmost element that was removed from q)**
