To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for node in graph[ver]:`. This means we can only adjust the states of `node`, `graph`, and `ver`.

1. **`ver`**: This variable is already defined as the vertex that was at the front of `q`. Since `ver` is used to index into `graph`, it must be a key in the `graph` dictionary.

2. **`graph`**: This is a dictionary or adjacency list representing the graph. For the loop to execute, `graph[ver]` must be a non-empty iterable (like a list or set) containing the neighbors of `ver`.

3. **`node`**: This variable will take on the values of the elements in `graph[ver]` during each iteration of the loop. Since the loop body is omitted, we don't need to adjust the state of `node` directly, but we need to ensure that `graph[ver]` contains at least one element for `node` to be assigned a value.

Given these considerations, to ensure the loop executes, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one neighbor.

State: **`ver` is a vertex that is a key in `graph` and `graph[ver]` is a list or set containing at least one neighbor**
