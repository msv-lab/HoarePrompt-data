The only variable in the loop head is `node`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates over each neighbor in `graph[ver]`. At the end of the last iteration, `node` was the last unvisited neighbor that was processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `node` must be updated to the next neighbor in `graph[ver]` that has not yet been processed.

Since `graph[ver]` contains at least one unvisited neighbor, and `node` was the last unvisited neighbor processed, we need to ensure that `node` is set to the next unvisited neighbor in `graph[ver]`. However, we do not have specific information about the order or the number of remaining neighbors except that there is at least one.

State: **`ver` is the leftmost element that was removed from `q`, `graph[ver]` contains at least one unvisited neighbor, `node` is the next unvisited neighbor in `graph[ver]`**.

Since the exact next unvisited neighbor is not specified, we can represent the state as having `node` set to the next unvisited neighbor in `graph[ver]` without specifying which one it is, as long as it is guaranteed to be unvisited.

State: **`ver` is the leftmost element that was removed from `q`, `graph[ver]` contains at least one unvisited neighbor, `node` is the next unvisited neighbor in `graph[ver]`**.
