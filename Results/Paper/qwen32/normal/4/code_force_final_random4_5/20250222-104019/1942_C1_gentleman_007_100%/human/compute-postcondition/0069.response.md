The code snippet `l.append(a[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `a` to the list `l`. This operation modifies the list `l` by adding a new element to it. The values of `dp`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` contains the length of the LCS of the first `i` elements of `a` and the first `j` elements of `b`. `dp[len(a)][len(b)]` represents the length of the LCS of `a` and `b`. `i` is decremented by 1 and must be non-zero. `j` is decremented by 1 and must be non-zero. `l` has an additional element `a[i]` appended to it.**
