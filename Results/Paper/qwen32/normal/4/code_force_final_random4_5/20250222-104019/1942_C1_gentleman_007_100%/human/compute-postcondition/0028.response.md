The only object in the loop head is the variable `node`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `graph[ver]`. If `graph[ver]` contains at least one unvisited neighbor, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ver` is the leftmost element that was removed from `q`, and `graph[ver]` must contain at least one unvisited neighbor.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `node` should be set to the next unvisited neighbor in `graph[ver]`.

State: **`ver` is the leftmost element that was removed from `q`, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one unvisited neighbor, `node` is the next unvisited neighbor in `graph[ver]`**
