To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given print statement and the initial state:

The print statement is:
```python
print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

We are given that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 for each test case. However, the variable `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, we need to consider `i` as an unknown value for this explanation.

Let's break down the print statement:

1. `1` - This is a literal integer value, so it will be printed as `1`.
2. `i` - This is an unknown value, so we will represent it as `i`.
3. `*range(n, 0, -1)` - This is a generator expression that creates a sequence of numbers starting from `n` down to `1` (inclusive) in reverse order. For example, if `n` is 5, `range(5, 0, -1)` will generate the sequence `5, 4, 3, 2, 1`.

Putting it all together, the output will be:
- The number `1`
- Followed by the value of `i`
- Followed by the sequence generated by `range(n, 0, -1)`

Since `i` is unknown, we will represent it as `i` in the output. The exact sequence generated by `range(n, 0, -1)` depends on the value of `n`, but we can represent it as `n, n-1, ..., 1`.

Thus, the final output format will be:
Output: **1, i, n, n-1, ..., 1 (where i is an unknown value and n is a given integer greater than or equal to 1)**

So, the final answer is:
Output: **1, i, n, n-1, ..., 1 (where i is an unknown value and n is a given integer greater than or equal to 1)**
