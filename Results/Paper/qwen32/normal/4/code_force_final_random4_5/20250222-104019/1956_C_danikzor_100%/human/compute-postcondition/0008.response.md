The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`. For the loop to continue, `i_prev + 1` must be less than `n + 1`, which simplifies to `i_prev < n`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, the new value of `i` at the start of the next iteration will be `i + 1`.

State: **`n` must be greater than `i`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**
