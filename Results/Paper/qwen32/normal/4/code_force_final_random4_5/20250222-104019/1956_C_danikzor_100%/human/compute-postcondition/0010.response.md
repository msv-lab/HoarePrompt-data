Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than `i`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Value of `2`**: This is a constant integer value. It will be printed as it is.
2. **Value of `i`**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, its exact value is not provided, but we can denote it as `i_new` (where `i_new = i_previous + 1`).
3. **`*range(n, 0, -1)`**: This will unpack the elements of the range from `n` down to 1 (inclusive) in descending order. Given that `n > i`, the range will include all integers from `n` down to 1.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the number `2`, followed by the new value of `i` (denoted as `i_new`), and then all integers from `n` down to 1.

### Final Output Description:
Output: **2, i_new, n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1 (where i_new is the value of i after being incremented by 1)**
