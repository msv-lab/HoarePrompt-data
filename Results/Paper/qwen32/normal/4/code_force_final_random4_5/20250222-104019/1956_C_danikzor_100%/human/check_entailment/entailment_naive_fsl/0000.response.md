Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the numbers in the matrix according to the problem description. Let's analyze the code and see why it is incorrect.

The program outputs the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of operations in the solution. It then describes the operations to achieve this sum. However, the operations described do not maximize the sum as intended.

The program calculates the maximum sum using the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`, which is not the correct formula to maximize the sum of the matrix under the given operations. Instead, the maximum sum should be `n * n * n` because each cell in the `n x n` matrix can be filled with the maximum value `n` using the operations.

Here is a correct approach to solve the problem:
1. For each row `i` (from 1 to n), perform a Type 1 operation where `a_{i, j} := n` for all `j` (from 1 to n). This ensures that each row contains the value `n` in all its cells.
2. For each column `i` (from 1 to n), perform a Type 2 operation where `a_{j, i} := n` for all `j` (from 1 to n). This ensures that each column contains the value `n` in all its cells.

By performing these operations, the matrix will be filled with `n` in all cells, resulting in a maximum sum of `n * n * n`.

Let's consider an example for `n = 2`:
- The maximum sum should be `2 * 2 * 2 = 8`.
- The operations could be:
  - Type 1 operation on row 1 with permutation `[2, 2]`: This sets `a_{1,1} = 2` and `a_{1,2} = 2`.
  - Type 1 operation on row 2 with permutation `[2, 2]`: This sets `a_{2,1} = 2` and `a_{2,2} = 2`.
  - Type 2 operation on column 1 with permutation `[2, 2]`: This sets `a_{1,1} = 2` and `a_{2,1} = 2`.
  - Type 2 operation on column 2 with permutation `[2, 2]`: This sets `a_{1,2} = 2` and `a_{2,2} = 2`.

The provided program does not achieve this and instead uses a different formula and operations, resulting in incorrect output.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
