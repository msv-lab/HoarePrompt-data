### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations. The operations involve permuting the rows and columns of the matrix with permutations of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

#### Key Points:
1. **Type 1 Operation**: Choose a row \( i \) and fill it with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).
2. **Type 2 Operation**: Choose a column \( i \) and fill it with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).
3. **Objective**: Maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.

#### Optimal Strategy:
To maximize the sum, we need to ensure that each element in the matrix is as large as possible. The largest sum we can achieve is when each element in the matrix is \( n \), which gives us the total sum of \( n^3 \). However, since we can only use permutations, the best we can do is to fill each row and column with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to achieve this by performing the following steps for each test case:
1. Read the size of the matrix \( n \).
2. Calculate the maximum possible sum of the matrix, which is given by the formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \). This formula is derived from the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers and their permutations.
3. Perform \( 2n \) operations:
   - For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), perform a Type 1 operation with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
   - For each column \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), perform a Type 2 operation with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

#### Verification:
Let's verify if this strategy works:
- **Sum Calculation**: The formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \) is correct for the maximum possible sum achievable with the given constraints. This formula represents the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers, each appearing \( n \) times in the matrix.
- **Operations**: The program performs exactly \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.
- **Permutations**: The permutations used are optimal for maximizing the sum, as they fill each row and column with the largest possible values.

However, let's check the implementation details:
- The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then iterates from \( t \) down to 1, calling `func_1()` in each iteration. This is incorrect because it should iterate from 1 to \( t \) to process each test case in order.
- The function `func_1()` correctly calculates the maximum sum and prints the operations as described.

#### Corrected Program:
The main issue is in the loop that processes the test cases. It should iterate from 1 to \( t \) instead of from \( t \) down to 1.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was inaccurate due to the incorrect loop iteration order. The corrected program is now correct.

Final: **False** (due to the original program's incorrect loop iteration order)
