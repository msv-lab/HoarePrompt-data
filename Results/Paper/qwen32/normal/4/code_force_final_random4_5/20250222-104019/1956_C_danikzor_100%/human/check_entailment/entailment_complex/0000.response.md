### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using a limited number of operations (no more than \( 2n \)).

#### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

2. **Output Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix elements using the formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \). This formula is derived from the fact that the maximum sum is achieved when each row and each column is filled with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \), and the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \). The formula accounts for the sum of all such permutations.
   - The program then outputs this sum along with the number of operations \( 2n \).

3. **Operations:**
   - For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), the program performs two operations:
     - A Type 1 operation where it assigns the row \( i \) with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
     - A Type 2 operation where it assigns the column \( i \) with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
   - This approach ensures that each row and each column is filled with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \), which maximizes the sum of the matrix.

4. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The approach ensures that each row and each column is filled with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \), which is optimal for maximizing the sum.
   - The number of operations is \( 2n \), which is within the allowed limit.

5. **Comments and Annotations:**
   - The comments in the annotated program are mostly correct, but there is a small mistake in the comment for the output line: it states that the printed value is based on `n` being the number of test cases, but it should be based on the size of the matrix for the specific test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and provides a valid sequence of operations to achieve this sum within the allowed limit of \( 2n \) operations. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
