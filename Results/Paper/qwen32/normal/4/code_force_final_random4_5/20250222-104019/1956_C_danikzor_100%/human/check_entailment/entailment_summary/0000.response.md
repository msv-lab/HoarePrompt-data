### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is supposed to solve the problem by maximizing the sum of all the numbers in an n x n matrix using no more than 2n operations. The operations allowed are:
- Type 1: Assigning a row `i` with a permutation of integers from 1 to n.
- Type 2: Assigning a column `i` with a permutation of integers from 1 to n.

The program calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix and the number of operations needed, which is `2 * n`. The maximum sum for an n x n matrix filled with permutations of integers from 1 to n is the sum of the first n natural numbers, taken n times for each row and each column, which is `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. **Calculation of Maximum Sum**: For each test case, it calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix using the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`.
3. **Output of Maximum Sum and Number of Operations**: It prints the maximum sum and the number of operations (`2 * n`).
4. **Generating Operations**: For each row and column from 1 to n, it prints two lines:
   - The first line is a Type 1 operation, which assigns the row `i` with the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.
   - The second line is a Type 2 operation, which assigns the column `i` with the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.

### Verification of Correctness:

- **Maximum Sum Calculation**: The formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` is correct for calculating the maximum sum of the matrix when filled with permutations of integers from 1 to n. This formula comes from the sum of all elements in an n x n matrix where each row and column contains a permutation of the first n natural numbers.
  
- **Number of Operations**: The program uses exactly `2 * n` operations, which is within the allowed limit.

- **Operation Details**: The operations are correctly specified. For each row and column, the program assigns the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`, which ensures that the maximum possible values are placed in the matrix.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and generates the required operations to achieve this sum within the allowed number of operations. Thus, the program is correct.

### Answer:

Correctness: **True**
