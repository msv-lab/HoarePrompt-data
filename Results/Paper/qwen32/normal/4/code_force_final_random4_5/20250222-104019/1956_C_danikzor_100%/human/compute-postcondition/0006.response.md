Let's break down the given code and initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

### Code to be executed:
```python
print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Value of `1`**: This is a constant integer value `1` that will be printed first.
2. **Value of `i`**: The value of `i` is not explicitly given, but we know that it is incremented by 1 from its previous value. Therefore, if `i` was 5 before the increment, it will be 6 after the increment. However, without knowing the exact previous value of `i`, we can only describe it as `i (incremented by 1 from its previous value)`.
3. **Value of `*range(n, 0, -1)`**: This generates a sequence of numbers starting from `n` down to 1. For example, if `n` is 5, the sequence will be `5, 4, 3, 2, 1`. Since `n` is not explicitly given, we can describe it as a sequence starting from `n` down to 1.

### Combining the Values:
- The first value printed is `1`.
- The second value printed is `i` (incremented by 1 from its previous value).
- The subsequent values are the sequence generated by `range(n, 0, -1)`.

### Final Output:
Based on the given information, the output will be:

Output: **1, i (incremented by 1 from its previous value), n, n-1, ..., 1 (where n is greater than or equal to 1)**
