The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NONE'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `i`, and `mn`) and their constraints or conditions. However, the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables; it simply outputs the string `'NONE'`.

Based on the provided information and the code snippet, here is the explanation:

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('NONE')
```
This statement will output the string `'NONE'` regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `i`, and `mn`.

Output: **NONE**
