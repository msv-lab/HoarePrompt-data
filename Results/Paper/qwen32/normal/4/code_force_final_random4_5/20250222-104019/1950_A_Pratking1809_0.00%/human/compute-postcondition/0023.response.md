The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'PEAK'`. The initial state describes various variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `i`, `mn`) and their relationships or constraints, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the content of the `print` statement itself.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state describes the constraints and values of several variables.
2. The `print` statement is `print('PEAK')`.
3. The content of the `print` statement is a string literal `'PEAK'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state, the output will simply be the string `'PEAK'`.

Output: **PEAK**
