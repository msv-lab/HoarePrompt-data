Reasoning:
The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of three digits (a, b, and c). It correctly identifies whether the digits form a "STAIR" (a < b < c), a "PEAK" (a < b > c), or neither ("NONE"). Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases (t) from the input.
2. It then iterates over each test case.
3. For each test case, it reads three integers (a, b, and c).
4. It checks if a < b < c and prints "STAIR" if true.
5. It checks if a < b > c and prints "PEAK" if true.
6. If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NONE".

The logic correctly covers all possible scenarios for the three digits:
- If a < b < c, it prints "STAIR".
- If a < b > c, it prints "PEAK".
- In all other cases, it prints "NONE".

The program does not contain any errors that would cause incorrect output for valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
