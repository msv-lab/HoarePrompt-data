Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's analyze what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input.
- `q` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `mn` is 100.
- If `a < b < c`, the condition holds as specified in the if part. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NONE')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet contains a single `print` statement that prints the string `'NONE'`. The value to be printed is explicitly given as `'NONE'` and does not depend on any of the variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `i`, `mn`) or any conditions.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'NONE'` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, or any other variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **NONE**
