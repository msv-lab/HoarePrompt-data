The code snippet `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `t`, `q`, `i`, and `mn` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input, `q` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mn` is 100**.
