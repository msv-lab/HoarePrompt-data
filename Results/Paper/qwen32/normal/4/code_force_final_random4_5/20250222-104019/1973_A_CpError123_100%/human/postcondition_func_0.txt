The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. For each test case, it checks if the sum of the scores is even. If the sum is odd, it outputs -1. If the sum is even, it calculates half of the sum and the sum of the first two scores, then outputs the smaller of these two values. The function does not modify the input scores.
