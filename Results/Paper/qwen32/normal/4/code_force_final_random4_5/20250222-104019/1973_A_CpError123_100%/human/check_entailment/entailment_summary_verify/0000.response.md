Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the original assessment. The program aims to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred given the scores of three players, provided the scores are consistent with the rules of the game.

### Analysis

1. **Sum of Scores Check**:
   - The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, the program correctly outputs `-1` because the total points in any set of games must be even (each game contributes 0, 1, or 2 points).

2. **Calculation of `x` and `y`**:
   - If the sum is even, the program calculates `x` as half of the total score `(a + b + c) // 2`. This value represents the total number of games played because each game contributes a total of 2 points (either 2 to the winner, or 1 to each player in case of a draw).
   - The program calculates `y` as the sum of the scores of the two players with the lowest scores `(a + b)`. This represents the maximum number of games that could have involved the two players with the lowest scores without exceeding their combined score.

3. **Output**:
   - The program then outputs the minimum of `x` and `y`. This is because the maximum number of draws that could have occurred is limited by the number of games played (`x`) and the number of games that could have involved the two players with the lowest scores (`y`).

### Verification Using Function Summary

The function summary aligns with the program's logic, stating that it calculates the minimum of half the total score and the sum of the lowest two scores. This logic is intended to find the maximum number of draws.

### Counterexample Analysis

Let's revisit the counterexample provided in the original assessment to verify if the program handles it correctly:

**Counterexample:**
Input:
```
1
0 0 2
```
Expected Output:
```
0
```
Explanation:
- The only way to achieve scores of `0, 0, 2` is if the third player won one game against one of the other players. This means there could be a draw in that game, but since the third player has 2 points, it implies they won the game. Therefore, the maximum number of draws is `0`.

The program's logic for this case:
- `(a + b + c) = 2` which is even.
- `x = (2 // 2) = 1`
- `y = (0 + 0) = 0`
- `min(x, y) = 0`

The program correctly outputs `0`, which is the expected result.

### Conclusion

The original assessment incorrectly identified a counterexample where the program actually produced the correct result. The program's logic is correct for determining the maximum number of draws based on the given constraints and rules.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**
