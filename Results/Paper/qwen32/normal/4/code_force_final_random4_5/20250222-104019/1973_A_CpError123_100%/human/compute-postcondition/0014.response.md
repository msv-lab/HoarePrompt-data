Postcondition: **`p_1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p_2` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p_3` is an integer between 0 and 30, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `a` is the first integer from the new input, `b` is the second integer from the new input, `c` is the third integer from the new input, and the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd; `x` is `(a + b + c) // 2`; `y` is `a + b`.**

Since the condition `(a + b + c) % 2 != 0` is always true given the precondition that the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, the else part is never executed. Therefore, the postcondition is the same as the if part.
