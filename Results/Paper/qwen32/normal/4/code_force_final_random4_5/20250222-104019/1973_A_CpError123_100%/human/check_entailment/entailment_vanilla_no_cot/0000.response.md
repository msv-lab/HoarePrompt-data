Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened. The logic in the program is incomplete and incorrect for the given problem.

Here are the key issues with the program:

1. **Handling Draws**: The program does not correctly account for the possibility of draws, which contribute 1 point to each player involved in the draw. The program's calculation of `x` and `y` does not properly reflect the rules of the game.

2. **Validation of Scores**: The program only checks if the total score `(a + b + c)` is even, which is a necessary condition but not sufficient to ensure the scores are valid. The program should also ensure that the scores can be achieved by valid game outcomes.

3. **Logic for Maximum Draws**: The program incorrectly calculates the maximum number of draws by simply taking the minimum of `(a + b + c) // 2` and `(a + b)`. This does not accurately reflect the rules of the game or the constraints provided.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should implement a more detailed logic to check the validity of the scores and calculate the maximum number of draws based on the rules of the game. This typically involves checking if the scores can be achieved by a combination of wins, losses, and draws that satisfy the given constraints.
