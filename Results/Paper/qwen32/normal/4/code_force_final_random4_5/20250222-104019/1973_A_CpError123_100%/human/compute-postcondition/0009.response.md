Let's break down the problem step by step using the given initial state:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3` are integers between 0 and 30.
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `a`, `b`, `c` are integers derived from the input.
   - The sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd.
   - `x` is calculated as `(a + b + c) // 2`.
   - `y` is calculated as `a + b`.

2. **Understanding `x` and `y`:**
   - Since `a + b + c` is odd, `a + b` must be even (because an odd number minus an even number is odd).
   - `x` is the integer division of the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` by 2. Since `a + b + c` is odd, `x` will be the integer part of the division, effectively rounding down.
   - `y` is simply the sum of `a` and `b`.

3. **Comparing `x` and `y`:**
   - `x = (a + b + c) // 2`.
   - `y = a + b`.
   - Since `a + b` is even, `x` will be less than or equal to `y` because we are taking the integer division of an odd number, which is rounded down.

4. **Determining the output:**
   - The `min(x, y)` function will always return `x` because `x` is derived from the integer division of an odd number and will thus be less than or equal to `y`.

Given the above analysis, we can conclude that the output of the `print(min(x, y))` statement will be `x`.

Output: **x (where x is (a + b + c) // 2 and a + b + c is the sum of the three input integers which is odd)**
