### Reasoning:

The original assessment carefully analyzed the problem and the provided program, and it seems to have correctly identified the key points and constraints:

1. **Total Points Calculation**: The assessment correctly noted that the total points awarded in all games must be even, because each game awards a total of 2 points (either 2 to the winner or 1 to each player in case of a draw).

2. **Maximum Draws**: The maximum number of draws is correctly calculated as `(a + b + c) // 2` because each draw awards 2 points. The program also correctly considers that the maximum number of draws cannot exceed the sum of the two lower scores (`a + b`), as the highest score `c` cannot be solely achieved through draws.

3. **Constraints on Player Scores**: The assessment correctly noted that the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` must fit into a scenario where the total points are even and the scores can be achieved through valid game results.

4. **Program Analysis**: The assessment correctly analyzed the program's logic:
   - **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads multiple test cases and the scores for each test case.
   - **Total Points Check**: The program correctly checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is even. If not, it outputs `-1` because it's impossible to have an odd total number of points from games.
   - **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the maximum possible number of draws as `(a + b + c) // 2` and compares it with `a + b` (the sum of the two lower scores).
   - **Output**: The program correctly outputs the minimum of `(a + b + c) // 2` and `a + b`, which represents the maximum number of draws possible under the given constraints.

5. **Verification**: The assessment verified the program with the provided example inputs and confirmed that the program produces the correct output for each case.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was accurate and the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. The program handles all the given constraints and test cases appropriately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
