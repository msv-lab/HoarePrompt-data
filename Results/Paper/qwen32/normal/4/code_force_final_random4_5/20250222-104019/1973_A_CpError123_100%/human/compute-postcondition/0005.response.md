Output State: **`p_1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p_2` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p_3` is an integer between 0 and 30, `t` is greater than 0, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `c` is the third integer from the input, and the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, the state of all variables remains the same as the initial state.
