The code snippet provided only reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer `t` represents the number of test cases, but no further operations are performed on it or any other variables in the given snippet. Therefore, the values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged as they were part of the initial state and not modified by the code.

Output State: **Each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order. The number of test cases t is an input integer.**
