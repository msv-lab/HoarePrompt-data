The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state of `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, and `t` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the new values for `a`, `b`, and `c`, and the unchanged values for `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, and `t`.

Output State: **`p_1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p_2` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p_3` is an integer between 0 and 30, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `c` is the third integer from the input.**
