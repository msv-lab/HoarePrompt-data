The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used for iteration and does not affect the loop's continuation, the only variable we need to adjust is `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was decremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Therefore, `t` should be incremented by 1 to reflect the state at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`p_1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p_2` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p_3` is an integer between 0 and 30, `t` is greater than 0, `a` is the first integer from the new input, `b` is the second integer from the new input, `c` is the third integer from the new input, and the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd; `x` is `(a + b + c) // 2`; `y` is `a + b`**
