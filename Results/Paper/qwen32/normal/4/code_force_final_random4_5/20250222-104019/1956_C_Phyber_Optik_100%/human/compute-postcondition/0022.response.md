To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand the range of the loop and how the variable `j` changes with each iteration.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
    print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```
Given that `n = 5`, the loop will iterate from `j = 1` to `j = 5`.

From the given output states:
- After 1 iteration (`j = 1`), `n` remains 5.
- After 2 iterations (`j = 4`), `n` remains 5.
- After 3 iterations (`j = 5`), `n` remains 5.

After all the iterations, `j` will have taken on all values from 1 to 5. Therefore, the final value of `j` after the loop completes will be 6 because the loop increments `j` and exits when `j` reaches `n + 1`.

The variable `sum` is not modified within the loop, so it remains as the result of the series computation for the given `n`, which is 102.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **`sum` is 102, `n` is 5, `j` is 6**

In natural language, after the loop has completed all its iterations, the final state is that the `sum` remains 102, `n` remains 5, and the loop variable `j` has reached 6, which is the value that causes the loop to terminate.
