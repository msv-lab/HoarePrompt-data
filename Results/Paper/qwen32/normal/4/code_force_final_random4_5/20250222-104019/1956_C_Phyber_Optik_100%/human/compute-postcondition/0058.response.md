The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`sum` is \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `t` is 2**
