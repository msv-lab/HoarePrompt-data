Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to determine if it's correct.

### Problem Breakdown:
- We have an `n x n` matrix filled with zeroes.
- We can perform two types of operations:
  - **Type 1**: Choose a row `i` and a permutation `p` of integers from 1 to `n`. Set `a_{i, j} := p_j` for all `j`.
  - **Type 2**: Choose a column `i` and a permutation `p` of integers from 1 to `n`. Set `a_{j, i} := p_j` for all `j`.
- The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix with no more than `2n` operations.

### Key Observations:
- The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling the matrix with the numbers 1 to `n` in a way that each number appears as many times as possible.
- The optimal strategy involves filling the matrix in a way that maximizes the sum of the largest numbers in each row and column.

### Solution Analysis:
- The provided solution calculates the sum of the matrix as follows:
  - It starts with a sum of 1.
  - For each `i` from 2 to `n`, it adds `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to the sum. This formula calculates the contribution of the number `i` to the sum.
- The number of operations is set to `2n`.
- The operations involve filling the matrix with the numbers 1 to `n` in a specific order, alternating between rows and columns.

### Verification:
- Let's verify the sum calculation:
  - For `n = 1`, the sum is 1.
  - For `n = 2`, the sum is `1 + (4 - 1) * 2 = 7`.
  - For `n = 3`, the sum is `1 + (4 - 1) * 2 + (9 - 4) * 3 = 1 + 6 + 15 = 22`.
- The operations are designed to fill the matrix with the numbers 1 to `n` in a way that maximizes the sum. The alternating pattern between rows and columns ensures that each number is placed optimally.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly calculates the maximum sum and provides a valid sequence of operations to achieve that sum within the allowed number of operations.

Correctness: **True**
