### Reasoning:

The goal is to maximize the sum of all the numbers in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations. The operations allowed are:

1. Type 1: Assign a permutation \( p \) to a row \( i \) such that \( a_{i, j} = p_j \) for all \( j \).
2. Type 2: Assign a permutation \( p \) to a column \( i \) such that \( a_{j, i} = p_j \) for all \( j \).

The key observation here is that each element in the matrix can be set to a value between 1 and \( n \). The optimal strategy is to fill the matrix with the largest possible values such that each row and each column contains a permutation of \( \{1, 2, \ldots, n\} \).

The sum of the maximum possible values in the matrix can be calculated as follows:
- The first row can be filled with values \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \).
- The second row can be filled with values \( 2, 3, \ldots, n, 1 \).
- The third row can be filled with values \( 3, 4, \ldots, n, 1, 2 \).
- And so on...

This pattern ensures that each row and each column is a permutation of \( \{1, 2, \ldots, n\} \), and the sum of all elements in the matrix is maximized. The sum can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers and the structure of the matrix.

The provided program calculates the maximum sum correctly using the formula:
\[ \text{sum} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} i \cdot (i \cdot n - \frac{(i-1) \cdot i}{2}) \]
which simplifies to:
\[ \text{sum} = \frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6} \]

The program also outputs the sequence of operations needed to achieve this maximum sum. It performs \( n \) operations of type 1 and \( n \) operations of type 2, which is within the limit of \( 2n \) operations.

### Correctness:

The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and provides a valid sequence of operations to achieve this sum. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
