Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `sum` is 95.
- `n` is an input integer (its exact value is not specified, but it is an integer).
- `j` is 6.
- `t` is 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(sum, n + n)
```

### Explanation:
- The first part of the `print` statement is `sum`, which is explicitly given as 95.
- The second part of the `print` statement is `n + n`, which simplifies to `2 * n`. Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can only express the output in terms of `n`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the value of `sum` (which is 95) followed by the value of `2 * n`.

Output: **95, 2 * n (where n is the input integer)**
