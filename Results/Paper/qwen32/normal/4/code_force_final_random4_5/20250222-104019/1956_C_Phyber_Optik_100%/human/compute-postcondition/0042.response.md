Let's break down the given print statement and determine what will be printed based on the initial state provided:

1. `print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))`

From the initial state, we know:
- `sum` is 95 (though it is not used in the print statement).
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 8.
- `j` is 8.
- `t` is 1.

First, let's evaluate `n - j + 1`:
- Given `n` must be greater than or equal to 8 and `j` is 8, the minimum value for `n` is 8.
- Therefore, `n - j + 1` evaluates to `8 - 8 + 1 = 1`.

Next, let's evaluate `*range(1, n + 1)`:
- The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates numbers starting from 1 up to `n` inclusive.
- Since the minimum value for `n` is 8, `range(1, n + 1)` will generate numbers from 1 to 8 inclusive.
- Therefore, `*range(1, n + 1)` will expand to `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8`.

Now, let's combine all the parts:
- The `print` statement will first print the number `2`.
- Then it will print the result of `n - j + 1`, which is `1`.
- Finally, it will print the expanded range `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8`.

Thus, the complete output will be:
Output: **2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8**
