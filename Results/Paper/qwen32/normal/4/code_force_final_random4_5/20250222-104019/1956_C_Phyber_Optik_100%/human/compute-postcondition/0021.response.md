To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's break down the code and the initial state provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is 5.
   - `j` is 5.
   - `sum` is the result of the series computation for the given `n`, but it is not used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for this specific task.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is: `print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))`
   - We need to evaluate each part of the print statement:
     - `2`: This is a constant integer value.
     - `n - j + 1`: Given that `n` is 5 and `j` is 5, this evaluates to `5 - 5 + 1`, which is `1`.
     - `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). Since `n` is 5, this will unpack to the sequence `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

3. **Combining the Results:**
   - The `print` statement will output the values `2`, `1`, followed by the unpacked range `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

Putting it all together, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **2 1 1 2 3 4 5**
