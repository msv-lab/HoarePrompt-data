To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` with the given initial state where `i` is 4. Let's calculate this step by step.

1. Calculate `i * i`:
   \[
   4 * 4 = 16
   \]

2. Calculate `(i - 1) * (i - 1)`:
   \[
   (4 - 1) * (4 - 1) = 3 * 3 = 9
   \]

3. Calculate `i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)`:
   \[
   16 - 9 = 7
   \]

4. Calculate `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`:
   \[
   7 * 4 = 28
   \]

5. Add this result to the current value of `sum`:
   \[
   \text{new sum} = \text{current sum} + 28
   \]
   Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `sum`, we will denote the new value of `sum` as `current sum + 28`.

The values of `n`, `j`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`sum` is updated by adding 28 to it, `n` must be at least 4, `j` is 6, `t` is 1, `i` is 4**.
