To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. The loop head is defined by the `for` statement: `for i in range(2, n + 1):`.

This means we need to ensure that the `range(2, n + 1)` can produce at least one value for `i` to iterate over. This will depend on the value of `n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Range Condition**: The `range(2, n + 1)` will generate values starting from 2 up to `n` (inclusive). For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 2.
2. **Variable `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 2`, we don't need to initialize `i` before the loop. The loop will automatically set `i` to 2 in the first iteration.
3. **Variable `n`**: As mentioned, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.
4. **Other Variables (`sum`, `j`, `t`)**: These variables are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, we should mention their initial states as they are part of the given state.

### Conclusion:
- The only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment is `n`. It must be at least 2.
- The other variables (`sum`, `j`, `t`) do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, but their initial states should be included in the final state.

### Final State:
State: **`sum` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `j` is `n + 1`, `t` is 2**
