You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        sum = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
        print(sum, n + n)
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
            print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n`. For each test case, it calculates a specific sum based on the formula \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\) and prints this sum along with `2n`. It then prints a series of `n` lines, each containing a sequence of numbers describing positions in an `n×n` matrix.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not produce the correct output for the given problem description. Let's analyze the code and the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Objective**: Maximize the sum of all the numbers in an \( n \times n \) matrix.
2. **Operations**:
   - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p \). Set \( a_{i,j} = p_j \) for all \( j \).
   - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p \). Set \( a_{j,i} = p_j \) for all \( j \).
3. **Constraints**:
   - Use no more than \( 2n \) operations.
   - The maximum sum can always be obtained in no more than \( 2n \) operations.
4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output the maximum sum and the number of operations.
   - For each operation, specify the type, the row/column index, and the permutation.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code calculates the sum as follows:
```python
sum = 1
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
```
This formula calculates the sum of the first \( n \) squares multiplied by their respective indices. However, the code does not actually perform the operations on the matrix to achieve this sum.

The code then prints the calculated sum and \( 2n \) operations, but it does not correctly implement the operations to achieve the maximum sum. The operations printed are:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
    print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```
These operations do not guarantee that the matrix will be filled in a way that maximizes the sum.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the case when \( n = 2 \):
- The maximum sum should be \( 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 8 \).
- The operations should be:
  - Set the first row to [1, 2].
  - Set the second row to [2, 3].

However, the code will print:
```
7 4
1 2 1 2
2 2 1 2
1 1 1 2
2 1 1 2
```
This does not achieve the maximum sum of 8.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the operations to achieve the maximum sum for the matrix. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
