The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 7, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 7. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to the new value of `j`.

State: **`sum` is 95, `n` must be greater than or equal to 8, `j` is 8, `t` is 1**
