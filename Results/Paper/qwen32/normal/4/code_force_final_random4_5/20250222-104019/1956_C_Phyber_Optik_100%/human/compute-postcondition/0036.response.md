Let's break down the given Python code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `sum` is 95
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `j` is 6
- `t` is 1

### Code to Execute:
```python
print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **First Argument (`2`)**:
   - The first argument in the `print` function is the integer `2`. This value is explicitly provided.

2. **Second Argument (`n - j + 1`)**:
   - `n` is a variable that must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `j` is 6.
   - The expression `n - j + 1` simplifies to `n - 6 + 1` or `n - 5`.
   - Since `n` is not explicitly given a value in the initial state, we can't determine a specific numerical value for `n - 5`. However, we can describe it as `n - 5`.

3. **Third Argument (`*range(1, n + 1)`)**:
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
   - Since `n` is not explicitly given a value, we can't determine the exact sequence. However, we can describe it as the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Output Description:
The `print` statement will output:
- The integer `2`.
- The result of the expression `n - 5`.
- The sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.

Since `n` is not explicitly provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values for the second and third parts of the output. However, we can provide a precise description based on the given information.

Output: **2, n - 5, 1, 2, ..., n (where n is a variable greater than or equal to 1)**
