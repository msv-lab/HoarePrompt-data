Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` != `i`; `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `i + 1`, `flag` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged and no further action is taken. `i` is 4.**
