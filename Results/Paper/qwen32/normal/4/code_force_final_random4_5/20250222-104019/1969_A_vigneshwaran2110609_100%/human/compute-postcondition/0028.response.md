The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables; it only exits the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `i`, `x`, `l`, and `flag` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `x` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers derived from the input string, and the element at index `l[i] - 1` in `l` is equal to `i + 1` (which is 5); `flag` is True.**
