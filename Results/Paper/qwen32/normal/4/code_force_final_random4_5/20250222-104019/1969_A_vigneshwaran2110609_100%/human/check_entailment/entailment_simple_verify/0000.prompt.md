You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of n distinct integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())

        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)
        
    #State: 3 is printed n times.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party. The logic in the code is flawed and does not handle all possible cases as described in the problem statement.

Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Invitation Logic:**
   - The code checks if `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` to determine if a pair of friends can attend the party with just 2 invitations. However, this condition only checks for mutual best friendships (i.e., if `i` is the best friend of `l[i]` and vice versa). It does not handle cases where more than one pair of friends can be invited with 2 invitations or where 3 invitations are necessary.

2. **Handling of Non-Mutual Best Friendships:**
   - The code does not handle cases where best friendships are not mutual. For example, if `p = [2, 3, 1, 5, 4]`, the code would incorrectly assume that 3 invitations are needed because no mutual best friendship exists. However, Monocarp can still invite friends 1 and 2, and friends 3 and 4, to ensure at least 2 friends attend.

3. **Edge Cases Not Considered:**
   - The code does not consider scenarios where multiple pairs of friends can be invited with 2 invitations. It only breaks the loop and prints 2 if it finds a single mutual best friendship. If no mutual best friendship is found, it defaults to printing 3 without checking other possible pairs.

To correctly solve the problem, Monocarp should invite friends in pairs where both friends in the pair are best friends of each other or can be brought to the party with minimal invitations. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        index += 1
        p = list(map(int, input[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        visited = [False] * n
        count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if not visited[i]:
                cycle_length = 0
                x = i
                while not visited[x]:
                    visited[x] = True
                    x = p[x] - 1
                    cycle_length += 1
                if cycle_length == 1:
                    count += 1
                elif cycle_length == 2:
                    count += 1
                else:
                    count += (cycle_length + 1) // 2
        results.append(count)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected version properly handles all cases by identifying cycles in the best friendship graph and calculating the minimum number of invitations needed for each cycle.
