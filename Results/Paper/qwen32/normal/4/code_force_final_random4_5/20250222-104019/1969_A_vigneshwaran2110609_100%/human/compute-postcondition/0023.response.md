The code snippet reads an input string, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `l`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `x` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers derived from the input string**.
