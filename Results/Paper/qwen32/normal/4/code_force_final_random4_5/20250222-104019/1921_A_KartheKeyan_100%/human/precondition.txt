test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000). The number of test cases t satisfies 1 <= t <= 100. Each test case guarantees that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0) area, with corners in the given points.
