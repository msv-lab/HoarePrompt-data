The code snippet sets the value of `res` to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`x` is the fourth integer from the input, `y` is the fourth integer from the input, `n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is [], `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**

In natural language, this means that `res` has been set to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values.
