The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `range(4)`. Therefore, we can only adjust the variable `i` for the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. Since the loop iterates over the range from 0 to 3, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Let's adjust `i` to 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`x` is the first integer from the new input, `y` is the second integer from the new input, `n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is `[(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (x, y), (x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 2, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**
