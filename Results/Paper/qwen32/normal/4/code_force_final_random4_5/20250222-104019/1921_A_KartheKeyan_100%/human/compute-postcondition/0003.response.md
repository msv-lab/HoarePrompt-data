The provided Python code snippet initializes an empty list named `coord`. No other operations are performed that would affect the initial state of the other variables or the list `coord`. Since the list `coord` is newly created and no values are added to it, it remains an empty list.

Output State: **Each test case consists of four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) where -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area; `n` must be a non-zero integer; `coord` is an empty list.**
