Output State: **`x` is the first integer from the last input, `y` is the second integer from the last input, `n` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `coord` is the sorted list of `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]`, `res` is `math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)`, `i` is 3, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**

Natural Language: The value of `n` has been decreased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
