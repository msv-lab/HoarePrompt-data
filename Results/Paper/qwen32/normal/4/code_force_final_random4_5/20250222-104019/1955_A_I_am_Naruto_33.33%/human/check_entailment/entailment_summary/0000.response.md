Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts based on the given prices `a` and `b`. Here's the detailed breakdown:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. If `n` is greater than 1, it calculates two possible costs:
   - `ans1`: The cost if all yogurts are bought individually, which is `a * n`.
   - `ans2`: The cost if yogurts are bought in pairs as much as possible, which is `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`. This accounts for buying `n // 2` pairs at the promotion price `b` and any remaining yogurt at the individual price `a`.
4. It then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
5. If `n` is 1, it simply prints `a` because there's no option to buy a pair.

The logic correctly handles the scenario where buying in pairs is more cost-effective than buying individually, and it also correctly handles the edge case when `n` is 1.

Correctness: **True**
