To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the calculations step by step.

### Initial State and Variables:
1. **`t`**: It is defined as `t - 2`, but the value of `t` itself is not provided, and it is not used in the `print` statement. So, we can ignore `t` for this calculation.
2. **`n`**: This is an integer provided by the input.
3. **`a`**: This is an integer provided by the input.
4. **`b`**: This is an integer provided by the input.
5. **`ans1`**: This is calculated as `a * n`.
6. **`ans2`**: This is calculated as `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.

### Calculations:
- **`ans1`**: This is straightforward. It is the product of `a` and `n`.
- **`ans2`**: This involves two parts:
  - `b * n // 2`: This is the integer division of the product of `b` and `n` by 2.
  - `a * n % 2`: This is the remainder when the product of `a` and `n` is divided by 2. This will be either 0 (if `a * n` is even) or 1 (if `a * n` is odd).

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the minimum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.

### Detailed Explanation:
- **`ans1`**: `a * n` is simply the product of `a` and `n`.
- **`ans2`**: This value is determined by the formula `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. The term `b * n // 2` contributes half of the product of `b` and `n` (integer division), and `a * n % 2` adjusts this value by adding 1 if `a * n` is odd.

### Final Output:
The output will be the minimum of `a * n` and `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.

Output: **min(a * n, b * n // 2 + a * n % 2)**
