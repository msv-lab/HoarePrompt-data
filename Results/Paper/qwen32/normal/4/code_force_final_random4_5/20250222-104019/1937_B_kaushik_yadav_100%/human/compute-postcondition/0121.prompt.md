Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is the input integer; `a` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `b` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `ans` is an empty string; `i` is 0; `work` is True; `j` is the last index for which the loop condition was satisfied; `counter` reflects the number of consecutive matching characters from `a` and `b` starting from `a[1]` and `b[0]`, with the special case of resetting when `a[j + 1] == '0'` and `b[j] == '1'`.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is the input integer; `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `b` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` is set to False. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with `b[0]`, and the loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `ans` remains the first character of `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`. If `work` is False, `ans` is the first character of `b` and `i` is set to 1. The variables `j` and `counter` maintain their respective states as described in the precondition.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is the input integer; `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `b` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `i` is less than the length of `a`. If `work` is True and `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` is set to False. If `work` is True and `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `ans` includes the characters `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `work` is True and `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `ans` includes the character `a[i]`. If `work` is False, `i` is incremented by 1, and `ans` includes the character `b[i]`. `j` and `counter` maintain their respective states as described in the precondition.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is the input integer; `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `b` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `work` is set to False. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, `ans` is updated to include both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] >= a[i + 1]`, `i` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is its previous value concatenated with `b[i-1]`. In all cases, `ans` is updated to include `a[i]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
