Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string; `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `ans` is the first character of `a`; `i` is 0; `work` is True; `i + 1` equals the length of `a`; `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]` (though `a[i + 1]` does not exist since `i + 1` equals the length of `a`).**
