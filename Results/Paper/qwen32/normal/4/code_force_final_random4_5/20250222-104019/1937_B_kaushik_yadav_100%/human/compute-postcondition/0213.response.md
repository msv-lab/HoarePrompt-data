The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `len(a) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `len(a) - 1` must be greater than 3, meaning `a` must have at least 5 characters.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string with at least 5 characters, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is the constructed string based on the loop logic, `i` is at least 2, `work` is either True or False, `j` is 3**
