The code `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `b` to the string `ans`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `ans`, we assume it is an empty string or has some initial value. After executing the code, the value of `ans` will be its previous value concatenated with `b[i]`. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is the input integer; `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `b` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `i` is less than the length of `a`; `ans` is its previous value concatenated with `b[i]`.**
