The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5) representing the length of the grid. This is followed by two binary strings of length n, representing the top row (a_{11} a_{12} \ldots a_{1n}) and the bottom row (a_{21} a_{22} \ldots a_{2n}) of the grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
