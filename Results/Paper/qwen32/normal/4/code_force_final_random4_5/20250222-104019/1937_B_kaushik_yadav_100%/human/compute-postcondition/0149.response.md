The code snippet assigns an integer value to `n` based on the input provided. The variable `t` was initially defined as `t - 1`, which implies that `t` has already been decremented by 1 at some point before the code snippet is executed. This operation on `t` does not affect the value of `n` or any other variable in the snippet provided. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `n` has been assigned the value of the integer input, and `t` remains as `t - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer**.
