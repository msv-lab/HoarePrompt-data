The value of `i` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is the input integer; `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `b` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `ans` is the first character of `b`; `i` is 1; `work` is False; `j` is the last index for which the loop condition was satisfied; `counter` reflects the number of consecutive matching characters from `a` and `b` starting from `a[1]` and `b[0]`, with the special case of resetting when `a[j + 1] == '0'` and `b[j] == '1'`.**
