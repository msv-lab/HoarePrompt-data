The code snippet `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of the string `b` to the string `ans`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `work`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is less than the length of `a`, `work` is a boolean value, `ans` is the original `ans` string concatenated with `b[i]`.**
