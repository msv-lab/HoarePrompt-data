The code snippet `ans += a[i]` appends the character at index `i` of the string `a` to the variable `ans`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a non-empty string
- `b` is the stripped input string
- `i` must be less than `len(a)`

The variable `ans` will be updated to include the character at position `i` of `a`. 

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the stripped input string, `i` must be less than `len(a)`, `ans` is updated to include `a[i]`**.

In natural language: The value of `t` remains `t - 1`, `n` remains an input integer, `a` remains a non-empty string, `b` remains the stripped input string, and `i` still must be less than the length of `a`. The variable `ans` now includes the character at index `i` of `a`.
