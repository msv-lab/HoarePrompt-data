Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string with at least 5 characters, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is the constructed string based on the loop logic, `i` is at least 2, `work` is either True or False, `j` is 3. If `a[j + 1] == b[j]`, then `counter` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'`, then `counter` is set to 1. In all other cases, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
