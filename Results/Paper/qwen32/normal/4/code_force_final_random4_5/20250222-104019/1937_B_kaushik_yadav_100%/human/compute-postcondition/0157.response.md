The code `ans += a[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to the string `ans`. Given that `i` is 0, `ans` will be updated to include the first character of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` must be a non-empty string, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is the first character of `a`, `i` is 0, `work` is True, and the current value of `work` is True.**
