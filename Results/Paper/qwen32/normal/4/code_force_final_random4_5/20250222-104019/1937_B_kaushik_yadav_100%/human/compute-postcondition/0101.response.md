Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is the input integer; `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `b` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `i` is less than the length of `a`; `work` is False; `ans` is a string that is being constructed and now includes the character `a[i]`; `j` and `counter` maintain their respective states as described in the precondition.**

Natural language description: The variable `work` has been set to `False`. All other variables maintain their initial values as described in the precondition.
