Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is an input integer; `a` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `ans` is an empty string; `i` is 0; `work` is True.**

Explanation: The variable `work` is assigned the value `True`. All other variables retain their initial values as no other operations affect them.
