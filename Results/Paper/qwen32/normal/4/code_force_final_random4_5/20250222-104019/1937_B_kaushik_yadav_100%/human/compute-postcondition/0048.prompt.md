Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is an input integer; `a` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `ans` is an empty string; `i` is 0; `work` is True.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string; `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` is set to False. Otherwise, `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with `b[0]` if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, otherwise `ans` remains the first character of `a`. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `i` is set to 0, otherwise `i` is set to 1, and `work` is True. If `work` is False, `ans` is the first character of `b`, `i` is 1, and `work` is False.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is less than the length of `a`. If `work` is set to `False`, it means `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `ans` includes the character `a[i]` and `b[i]` appended to it, and the loop breaks. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, `work` is set to `False`. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1, and `ans` includes the character `a[i-1]` appended to it. If `work` is still `True` after the if condition, `i` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is the original `ans` string concatenated with `b[i-1]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is less than the length of `a`. If `work` is `True`, `ans` includes the character `a[i]` appended to it. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, `work` is set to `False`. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `b[i]` is appended to `ans` and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 and `work` is set to `False` if `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`. If `work` is `False`, `i` is incremented by 1 and `ans` includes the character `b[i]` appended to it.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
