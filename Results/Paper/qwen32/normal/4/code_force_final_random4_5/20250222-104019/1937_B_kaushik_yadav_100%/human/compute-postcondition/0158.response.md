Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is the first character of `a`, `i` is 0, `work` is True, and the current value of `work` is True. Additionally, `i + 1` is less than the length of `a`, and the character at position `i` in `b` is less than the character at position `i + 1` in `a`.**
