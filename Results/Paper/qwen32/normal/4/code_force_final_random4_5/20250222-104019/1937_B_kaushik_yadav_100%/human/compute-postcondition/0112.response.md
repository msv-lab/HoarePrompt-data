Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is the input integer; `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `b` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `i` is less than the length of `a`; `ans` is updated to include `a[i]`; `work` is False.**

Natural language: The variable `work` has been set to `False`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
