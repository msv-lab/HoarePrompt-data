The code snippet `a = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace from it, and assigns the result to the variable `a`. The initial state of `t` and `n` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string**.
