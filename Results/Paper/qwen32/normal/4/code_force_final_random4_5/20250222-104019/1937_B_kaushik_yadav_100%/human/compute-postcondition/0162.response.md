The code snippet `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of the string `b` to the string `ans`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so `b[i]` is the first character of `b`. Since `b` is the stripped input string and `ans` is already the first character of `a`, the new value of `ans` will be the concatenation of the first character of `a` and the first character of `b`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the first character of `b`, `i` is 0, `work` is True, and `i + 1` equals the length of `a`**.
