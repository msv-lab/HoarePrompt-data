The code snippet appends the value of `n` to the list `path_ba`. Given the initial state, `n` is the value of `previous[b]`. Therefore, `path_ba` will now contain two elements: the original single element `b` and the new element `n`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `a` to each vertex in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that tracks the path taken to reach each vertex from vertex `a`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `[b, previous[b]]`; `n` is `previous[b]`. If `n` is equal to -1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
