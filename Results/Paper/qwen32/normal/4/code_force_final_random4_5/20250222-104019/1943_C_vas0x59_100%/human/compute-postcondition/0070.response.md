Postcondition: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `a` to each vertex in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that tracks the path taken to reach each vertex from vertex `a`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` inclusive, where the last vertex in the list is `a` and `previous[a]` is `-1`. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, the state of `ops` remains unchanged (empty). If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list containing `len(path_ba) // 2` elements, each being a tuple `(c1, i)` or `(c2, i)` where `i` increments by 2 each time; `ci2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`; `ci1` is the integer value of `(len(path_ba) // 2) - 1`; `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`; `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`.**
