The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use. The loop will execute based on the range provided, which is `n - 1`. Therefore, the state of `n` is the only thing that can ensure the loop executes.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least 2 because `n - 1` needs to be at least 1 for the loop to run at least once.

State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, representing the number of vertices in the tree, and `u` and `v` are integers representing the vertices connected by an edge such that 0 <= u, v < n.**
