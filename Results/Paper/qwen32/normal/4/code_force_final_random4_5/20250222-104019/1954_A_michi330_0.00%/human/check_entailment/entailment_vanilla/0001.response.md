To determine the correctness of the program, let's analyze the logic step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice paints a ribbon of `n` parts using `m` colors.
   - Bob can repaint up to `k` parts to any color.
   - Alice wants to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color after his repainting.

2. **Conditions for Alice's Victory:**
   - If Alice can paint the ribbon such that no single color can dominate all parts even after Bob repaints `k` parts, she wins.
   - This means that the largest group of parts of any single color should be less than `n - k` after Alice's initial painting.

3. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - If Alice uses all `m` colors, the most evenly distributed coloring would have about `n/m` parts of each color.
   - The maximum number of parts of any single color after Alice paints would be `math.ceil(n / m)`.
   - If `math.ceil(n / m) < n - k`, then even after Bob repaints `k` parts, it's impossible for all parts to be the same color (since the largest group of any color would still be less than `n - k`).

4. **Program Logic:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It checks if `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`.
     - If either condition is true, it prints 'NO', meaning Bob can make all parts the same color.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'YES', meaning Alice can prevent Bob from making all parts the same color.

5. **Analysis of Conditions:**
   - `n <= k`: If `n` is less than or equal to `k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color, so the answer is 'NO'.
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`: If the largest group of any single color after Alice's painting is less than `n - k`, Bob cannot make all parts the same color, so the answer is 'YES'.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic based on the above conditions.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
