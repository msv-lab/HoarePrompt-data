The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `itest`, `n`, `m`, `k`) and conditions that must be true. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of these variables or any computation based on them. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Given this, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **NO**
