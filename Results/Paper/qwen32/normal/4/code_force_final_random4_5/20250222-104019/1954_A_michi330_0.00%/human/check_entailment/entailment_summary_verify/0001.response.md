Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to verify the correctness of the program.

### Problem Analysis
We need to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color after repainting at most `k` parts. The key insight here is:

- If Alice can distribute the colors such that no single color appears more than `n - k` times, then Bob cannot repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.

### Key Conditions
1. If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color, so the answer is 'NO'.
2. If the most frequent color appears more than `n - k` times, then Bob can repaint the remaining parts to make all parts the same color, so the answer is 'NO'.
3. Otherwise, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that no single color appears more than `n - k` times, making it impossible for Bob to make all parts the same color, so the answer is 'YES'.

### Mathematical Insight
- The maximum number of parts of any single color after Alice's painting is `math.ceil(n / m)`.
- If `math.ceil(n / m) < n - k`, then Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

### Program Evaluation
The program logic is as follows:
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
- It checks if `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`.
  - If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'.
  - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

### Function Summary
The function summary correctly describes the logic used by the program:
- It processes `t` test cases.
- For each test case, it prints 'NO' if `n <= k` or if the difference between `n` and the ceiling of `n / m` is less than `k`.
- Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

### Verification of Original Assessment
The original assessment correctly identifies the conditions under which Alice can prevent Bob from making all parts the same color:
- `n <= k` means Bob can repaint all parts to the same color.
- `math.ceil(n / m) < n - k` ensures that no single color dominates after Bob's repainting.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic based on the above conditions. The original assessment accurately evaluates the program's correctness.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
