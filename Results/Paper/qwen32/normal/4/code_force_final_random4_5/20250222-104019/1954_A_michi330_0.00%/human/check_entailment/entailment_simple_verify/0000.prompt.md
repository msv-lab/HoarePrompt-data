You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob have bought a ribbon consisting of n parts. Now they want to
paint it.

First, Alice will paint every part of the ribbon into one of m colors. For
each part, she can choose its color arbitrarily.

Then, Bob will choose at most k  parts of the ribbon and repaint them into the
same color (he chooses the affected parts and the color arbitrarily).

Bob would like all parts to have the same color. However, Alice thinks that
this is too dull, so she wants to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob
cannot make all parts have the same color.

Is it possible to paint the ribbon in such a way?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing three integers n , m and k (1
\le m, k \le n \le 50 ) — the number of parts, the number of colors and the
number of parts Bob can repaint, respectively.

Output

For each test case, print YES if Alice can paint the ribbon so that Bob cannot
make all parts have the same color. Otherwise, print NO.

You can print every letter in any register. For example, Yes, yes, yEs will
all be recognized as positive answer.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1
    
    5 1 1
    
    5 2 1
    
    5 2 2
    
    5 5 3

Output

    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first test case, a ribbon consists of 1 part. So all its parts will
always have the same color.

In the second test case, there is only 1 color.

In the third test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]
. It's impossible to change the color of at most 1 part so that all parts have
the same color.

In the fourth test case, no matter how Alice paints the ribbon, Bob will
always be able to repaint 2 parts so that all parts have the same color.

In the fifth test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
. It's impossible to change the color of at most 3 parts so that all parts
have the same color.

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('Yes')



- Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50), where n is the number of parts of the ribbon, m is the number of colors available, and k is the maximum number of parts Bob can repaint.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('Yes')
        
    #State: `t` remains the same, `itest` equals `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` hold the values from the last test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
- **Objective**: Determine if Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.
- **Constraints**:
  - Alice can use `m` colors.
  - Bob can repaint at most `k` parts.
  - The ribbon has `n` parts.
- **Logic**:
  - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts to make them the same color, so the answer is `NO`.
  - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, Bob can repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color, so the answer is `NO`.
  - Otherwise, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color, so the answer is `YES`.

### Program Analysis
The provided program implements the above logic. Let's check if it handles all edge cases correctly.

### Edge Cases to Consider
1. **Single Part (`n = 1`)**:
   - If `n = 1`, Bob can always repaint it, so the answer should be `NO`.
   - The program correctly returns `NO` if `n <= k`.

2. **Single Color (`m = 1`)**:
   - If `m = 1`, Alice can only use one color, so Bob can always repaint to make all parts the same color, so the answer should be `NO`.
   - The program correctly returns `NO` if `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` which simplifies to `n - n < k` or `-n < k`, which is always true for positive `n` and `k`.

3. **Multiple Parts and Colors (`n > 1`, `m > 1`)**:
   - If `n > k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k`, Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color, so the answer should be `YES`.
   - The program correctly returns `YES` for these cases.

4. **Maximum Values (`n = 50`, `m = 50`, `k = 50`)**:
   - If `n = 50`, `m = 50`, and `k = 50`, Alice can paint each part a different color, and Bob cannot make all parts the same color, so the answer should be `YES`.
   - The program correctly returns `YES` for these cases.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the program and considering various edge cases, it appears that the program correctly handles all scenarios described in the problem statement. There are no apparent edge cases that the program does not handle correctly.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. It handles all edge cases, including when `n <= k` and when `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`. For all other cases, it correctly returns `YES`.
