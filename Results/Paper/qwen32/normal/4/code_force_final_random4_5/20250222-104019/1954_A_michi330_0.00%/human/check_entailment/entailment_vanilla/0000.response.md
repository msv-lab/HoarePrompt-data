To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic used to decide whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

### Analysis

**Problem Understanding:**
- Alice paints the ribbon with `n` parts using `m` colors.
- Bob can repaint up to `k` parts to the same color.
- Alice wants to ensure that Bob cannot make all `n` parts the same color.

**Key Insight:**
- If Alice can paint the ribbon such that there are at least `m` different colors used and the most common color has fewer than `n - k` parts, then Bob cannot repaint all parts to the same color.
- Conversely, if the most common color can be increased to cover all `n` parts by repainting at most `k` parts, then Alice cannot achieve her goal.

**Logic in the Program:**
- The condition `n <= k` implies that if the number of parts `n` is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint `k`, then Bob can always make all parts the same color by repainting all parts. Hence, the answer is 'NO'.
- The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` implies that if the number of parts that need to be repainted to make all parts the same color (if initially, the parts are distributed as evenly as possible among the `m` colors) is less than `k`, then Bob can make all parts the same color. Hence, the answer is 'NO'.
- If neither condition is met, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color, so the answer is 'YES'.

### Verification with Test Cases

Let's verify the logic with the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1: `n=1, m=1, k=1`**
   - `n <= k` is true, so the answer is 'NO'. This is correct because Bob can repaint the single part.
   
2. **Test Case 2: `n=5, m=1, k=1`**
   - `n <= k` is false, but `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 5 = 0 < k` is true, so the answer is 'NO'. This is correct because Bob can repaint one part to make all parts the same color.
   
3. **Test Case 3: `n=5, m=2, k=1`**
   - `n <= k` is false, and `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2 >= k` is true, so the answer is 'YES'. This is correct because Alice can paint the ribbon as [1, 2, 1, 2, 1], and Bob cannot make all parts the same color by repainting one part.
   
4. **Test Case 4: `n=5, m=2, k=2`**
   - `n <= k` is false, but `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2 <= k` is true, so the answer is 'NO'. This is correct because Bob can repaint two parts to make all parts the same color.
   
5. **Test Case 5: `n=5, m=5, k=3`**
   - `n <= k` is false, and `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 1 = 4 > k` is true, so the answer is 'YES'. This is correct because Alice can paint the ribbon with all different colors, and Bob cannot make all parts the same color by repainting three parts.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. The logic checks the conditions as described and provides the correct output for the given test cases.

**Correctness: True**
