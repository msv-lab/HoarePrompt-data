Reasoning:
The problem requires us to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot repaint at most `k` parts to make all parts the same color. Let's break down the logic in the provided code:

1. **Condition `n <= k`**: If the number of parts `n` is less than or equal to `k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color regardless of how Alice paints them initially. Therefore, in this case, the answer should be "NO".

2. **Condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`**: This condition is more complex. `n / m` represents the average number of parts per color if the parts were evenly distributed among the `m` colors. `math.ceil(n / m)` gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to this average, which means the maximum number of parts that can be painted with the most frequent color if the parts are distributed as evenly as possible. If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it means that Bob can repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color, even if Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible. Thus, the answer should be "NO" in this case.

3. **Otherwise**: If neither of the above conditions is true, it means Alice can distribute the colors in such a way that Bob cannot repaint at most `k` parts to make all parts the same color. Therefore, the answer should be "YES".

The code correctly implements this logic, so it should work as intended based on the problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
