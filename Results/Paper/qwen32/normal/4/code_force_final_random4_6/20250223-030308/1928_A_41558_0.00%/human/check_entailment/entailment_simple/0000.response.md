### Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the logic of the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements.

The problem states that Bob can form a new rectangle if he can cut the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange these two smaller rectangles to form a new one that differs from the original rectangle (considering rotations).

The provided program has the following logic:
1. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints "NO". This is correct because if both dimensions are odd, cutting the rectangle will always result in two rectangles with one odd and one even dimension, which cannot be rearranged to form a rectangle with both dimensions odd.
2. If `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`, it prints "NO". This condition is incorrect. If `a / 2 == b` (or vice versa), it means one dimension is exactly twice the other. In this case, it is still possible to cut and rearrange to form a new rectangle (e.g., a 4x2 rectangle can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles, which can be rearranged into a 2x4 rectangle). So, this condition should not lead to a "NO" answer.
3. Otherwise, it prints "YES". This is generally correct because if the above conditions are not met, it should be possible to cut and rearrange the rectangles to form a new one.

Given the above analysis, the problem with the program is the incorrect handling of the condition `a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a`. This condition should not result in a "NO" answer, as it is possible to form a new rectangle in such cases.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program incorrectly handles the condition where one dimension is exactly twice the other, leading to incorrect results for some test cases.
