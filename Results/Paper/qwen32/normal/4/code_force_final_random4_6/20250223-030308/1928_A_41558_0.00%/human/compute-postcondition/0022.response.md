The given `print` statement is `print('NO')`. This statement directly prints the string `'NO'` to the output. The variables and objects mentioned in the initial state (`t`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`) do not affect the output of this specific print statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement contains a literal string `'NO'`.
2. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`), but they are not used in the `print` statement.
3. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string provided in the `print` statement.

Output: **NO**
