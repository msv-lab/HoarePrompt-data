The code snippet assigns an integer value from the input to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the `t` test cases, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. The variable `n` is introduced and assigned the value of an integer input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, and for each of the `t` test cases, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.**
