The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement will print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` as described in the initial state. The initial state provides conditions and constraints on these variables but does not affect the output of the `print` statement, which is a static string.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **NO**
