The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides descriptions of several variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will be exactly the string `'YES'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
2. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided in the print statement.
3. None of the variables `t`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b` are referenced in the print statement, so their values do not affect the output.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **YES**
