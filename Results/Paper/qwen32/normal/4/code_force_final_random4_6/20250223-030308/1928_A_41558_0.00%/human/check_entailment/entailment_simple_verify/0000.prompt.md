You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: The loop has executed `n` times, where `n` is the number of iterations specified. For each of the `n` iterations, integers `a` and `b` were read from the input, and based on the conditions provided, 'YES' or 'NO' was printed. The value of `i` in the loop ranges from 0 to `n-1`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged throughout the execution.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether Bob can form another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two and rearranging the pieces. Let's analyze the logic in the program and find a counterexample.

The program's logic is:
1. If both dimensions `a` and `b` are odd, print "NO".
2. If one dimension is exactly half of the other, print "NO".
3. Otherwise, print "YES".

However, this logic is flawed. Here are some counterexamples:

1. **Counterexample 1**: Rectangle with dimensions 3x4
   - The program will print "YES" because neither dimension is odd and one is not exactly half of the other.
   - However, cutting a 3x4 rectangle into two 3x2 rectangles can form a 2x6 rectangle, which is different from 3x4.

2. **Counterexample 2**: Rectangle with dimensions 5x4
   - The program will print "YES" because neither dimension is odd and one is not exactly half of the other.
   - However, cutting a 5x4 rectangle into two 5x2 rectangles can form a 2x10 rectangle, which is different from 5x4.

3. **Counterexample 3**: Rectangle with dimensions 6x3
   - The program will print "NO" because one dimension is exactly half of the other.
   - However, cutting a 6x3 rectangle into two 3x3 rectangles can form a 3x6 rectangle, which is different from 6x3.

The correct approach should be to check if the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then rearranged to form a different rectangle. This can be achieved if at least one of the dimensions is even, as an even dimension can be split into two equal parts, and these parts can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage
# func()
```
In this corrected version, the program checks if at least one of the dimensions is even. If so, it prints "YES", indicating that Bob can form another rectangle. Otherwise, it prints "NO". This logic correctly handles all cases as described in the problem statement.
