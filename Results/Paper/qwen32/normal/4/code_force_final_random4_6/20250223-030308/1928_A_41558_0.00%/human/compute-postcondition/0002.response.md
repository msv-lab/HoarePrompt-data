The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range, and for each of the `t` test cases, `a` and `b` are integers within a certain range. However, the code snippet only deals with a single test case at a time.

Given the input, `a` and `b` will take on specific integer values. The values of `t` and the constraints on `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, and for each of the `t` test cases, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input.**
