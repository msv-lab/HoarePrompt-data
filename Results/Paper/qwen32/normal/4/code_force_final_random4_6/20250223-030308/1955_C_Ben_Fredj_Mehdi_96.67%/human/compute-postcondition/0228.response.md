The code snippet assigns the variable `d` the value of `len(a) - 1`. This means `d` will hold the index of the last element in the list `a`.

Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `a`, `z`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The variable `d` is newly introduced and holds the value of `len(a) - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input line split by spaces; `z` is incremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space; `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting just after the first space to the end of the string; `d` is `len(a) - 1`.**
