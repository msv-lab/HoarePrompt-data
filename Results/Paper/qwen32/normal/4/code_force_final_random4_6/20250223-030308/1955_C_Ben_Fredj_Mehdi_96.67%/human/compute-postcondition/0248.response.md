Output State: **the state is unknown and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement will terminate the most internal loop or if statement, but since the initial state is unknown and there are no variables being modified, the state remains unknown except for the fact that the execution will exit the current loop or if block.
