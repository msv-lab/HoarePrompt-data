The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'199999'`. This string is hardcoded in the `print` statement and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state.

Let's break down the initial state to ensure there's no confusion:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input line split by spaces.
- `z` is incremented by 1.
- `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space.
- `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting just after the first space to the end of the string.

However, none of these variables (`t`, `a`, `z`, `n`, `k`) are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'199999'`.

Given this information, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not change based on the values of the variables.

Output: **199999**
