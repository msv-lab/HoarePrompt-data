The code snippet extracts the substring of `a` up to the first space, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, and `a` is an input string. After the code execution, `n` will hold the integer value of the substring of `a` up to the first space. The values of `t` and the remainder of `a` (after the first space) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is an input string; `n` is the integer value of the substring of `a` up to the first space.**
