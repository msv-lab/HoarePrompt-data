Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers where the first element has been decreased by 1. If `a[d]` is 0, then the last element of `a` is 0 and `d` is the length of `a` minus 2, otherwise, the last element of `a` remains unchanged and `d` is the length of `a` minus 1; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space minus 1; `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space; `k` is at least 2 and not equal to any of the specified forbidden values; `g` is 1 if `a[0]` was 0, otherwise `g` remains 0. If `a[0]` was 0, then `a[1]` is the second element of `a`.**
