Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
2. `a` is a list of integers.
3. `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space.
4. `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space.
5. `z` is incremented by 1.

### Key Points:
- The value of `t` is not used in the print statement.
- The list `a` and its substrings `n` and `k` are not used in the print statement.
- The variable `z` is incremented but not used in the print statement.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement given is:
```python
print('1')
```

### Explanation:
The print statement directly prints the string `'1'`. None of the variables `t`, `a`, `n`, `k`, or `z` are used in this print statement, so their values do not affect the output.

### Final Output:
The output of the print statement is simply the string `'1'`.

Output: **1**
