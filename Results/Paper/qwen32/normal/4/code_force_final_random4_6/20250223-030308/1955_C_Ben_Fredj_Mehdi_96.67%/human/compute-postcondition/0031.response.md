Let's analyze the given code and initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string.
- `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space.
- `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space.
- `k` is explicitly set to 199999999999999.
- Several conditions are provided about `n` and `k`:
  - It is not the case that (n == 1 and k == 10000000000000 and a[0] == 1).
  - `k` is not equal to 1999999998.
  - `k` is not equal to 1999999999.
  - `k` is not equal to 9999999999.
  - It is not the case that (n == 101 and k == 100000000000).
  - `k` is not equal to 10000000000000.
  - `k` is not equal to 99999999999999.
- The current value of `k` is explicitly stated to be 199999999999999.

### Code to Execute:
```python
print('199999')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code explicitly prints the string `'199999'`. The value of `k` (which is 199999999999999) is not used in the `print` statement. The string `'199999'` is a constant string and will be printed as is.

### Output:
Output: **199999**
