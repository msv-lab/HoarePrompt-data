Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space; `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space; `z` is incremented by 1; `d` is `len(a) - 1`; `g` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k // 2):
    try:
        a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
        if a[g] == 0:
            g += 1
        if a[d] == 0:
            d -= 1
    except:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers where the first element `a[0]` is decremented by 1. If `a[0]` was 0, then `g` is 1; otherwise, `g` remains 0. The last element `a[d]` is decremented by 1, and if it was 0, `d` is `len(a) - 2`; otherwise, `d` remains `len(a) - 1`. `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space; `k` is an integer value of at least 2; `z` is incremented by 1; `i` is 0. If an exception occurs, the state is unknown and the loop or if statement is broken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: If no exception occurs, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers with `a[g]` decremented by 1 and `g` incremented by 1 if `a[g]` was 0, `a[d]` decremented by 1 and `d` decremented by 1 if `a[d]` was 0, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space, `k` is an integer value of at least 2, `z` is incremented by 1, and `i` is 1. If an exception occurs, the state is unknown and the loop or if statement is broken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: If no exception occurs, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers with `a[g]` decremented by 1, and `a[d]` decremented by 1. If `a[g]` is 0, `g` is incremented by 1. If `a[d]` is 0, `d` is decremented by 1. `n`, `k`, `z`, and `i` remain unchanged. If an exception occurs, the state is unknown and the loop or if statement is broken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
