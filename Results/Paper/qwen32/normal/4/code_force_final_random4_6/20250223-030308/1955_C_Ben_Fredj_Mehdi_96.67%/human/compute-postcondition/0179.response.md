Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers where the first `k // 2` elements and last `k // 2` elements have been decremented by 1; `g` points right after the last non-zero element from the start and `d` points right after the last non-zero element from the end; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space; `k` is the integer value starting right after the first space and `k` is odd; `z` is incremented by 1 for each outer code iteration (not the loop itself); `i` is `k // 2`.**
