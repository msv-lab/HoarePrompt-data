The code assigns the value of `len(a) - 1` to the variable `d`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `n`, `k`, and `z`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space; `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space; `z` is incremented by 1; `d` is `len(a) - 1`.**
