Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space; `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space. If `k` is equal to 99999999999999, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `k` is not equal to 1999999998, 1999999999, 9999999999, 99999999999, 99999999999999, 10000000000000, 199999999999999, 1000000000000, 200000000000, 2147483648, 5999999999, 4294967295, 3000000000, and `k` is not greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in the list `a`, unless `n` equals 2 and `k` equals `a[0] - 1` and `k` equals `a[1] - 2`, or `n` equals 2 and `k` equals 1000000000 and `a` is [1000000000, 1000000000], or `n` equals 5 and `k` equals 2147483648, or `n` equals 20 and `k` equals 10000000000. If `k` equals any of the specified values or conditions, the state remains unchanged. If none of these conditions are met, the first `k // 2` non-zero elements and last `k // 2` non-zero elements of `a` are decremented by 1, and if `k` is odd, `a[g]` is also decremented by 1. `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and `g` and `d` remain unchanged.**
