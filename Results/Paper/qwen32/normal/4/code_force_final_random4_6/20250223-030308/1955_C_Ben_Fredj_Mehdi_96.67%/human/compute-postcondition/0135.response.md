Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
2. `a` is a list of integers.
3. `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space.
4. `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space.
5. `z` is incremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('199999')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `a`, `n`, `k`, or `z`. The statement directly prints the string `'199999'`.

### Output:
Since the `print` statement is printing a hardcoded string, the output will be exactly that string.

Output: **199999**
