In the given initial state, we have several variables described, but the `print` statement in the provided code snippet is:

```python
print('2')
```

This `print` statement explicitly outputs the string `'2'`. The values of the variables `t`, `a`, `z`, `n`, and `k` do not affect the output of this particular `print` statement because it is printing a hardcoded string.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **2**
