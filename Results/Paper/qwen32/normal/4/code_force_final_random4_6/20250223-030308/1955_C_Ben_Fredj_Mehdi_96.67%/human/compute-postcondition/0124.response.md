The code snippet provided updates the value of `n` by converting the substring of `a` up to the first space into an integer. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `k`, and `z`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is the input string; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space; `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space; `z` is incremented by 1.**
