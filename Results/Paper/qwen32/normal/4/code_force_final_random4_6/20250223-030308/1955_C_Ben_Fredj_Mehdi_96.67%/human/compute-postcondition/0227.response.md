Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step-by-step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
2. **`a`**: A list of integers. This list is obtained from an input line that is split by spaces.
3. **`z`**: Incremented by 1 (though `z` is not used in the `print` statement, so its value does not affect the output).
4. **`n`**: The integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space. In other words, `n` is the first element of the list `a`.
5. **`k`**: The integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting just after the first space to the end of the string. In other words, `k` is the second element of the list `a`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(len(a))
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(len(a))` statement will print the length of the list `a`.
- According to the initial state, `a` is a list of integers that is obtained from an input line split by spaces. Therefore, the length of `a` will be the number of integers in the input line.

### Output:
The output will be the number of integers in the list `a`, which is the number of space-separated integers in the input line.

### Final Answer:
Output: **the number of integers in the list `a` (which is the number of space-separated integers in the input line)**
