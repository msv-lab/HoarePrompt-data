The code snippet provided only affects the variable `d` by decrementing it by 1. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `g`) remain unchanged unless their values are directly dependent on `d` in a way that is not specified in the given code snippet.

Given the initial state, `d` is decremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `d` will be its previous value minus 1.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers where the first element, the element at index `g`, and the element at index `d` have been decreased by 3, `d` is decremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space minus 1, `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space and remains unchanged, `k` is at least 2 and not equal to any of the specified forbidden values, `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[g]` was 0 after the first decrement, `g` is incremented by 2; otherwise, `g` remains unchanged.**

In natural language: The value of `d` is now one less than its previous value. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
