The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print('10000')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'10000'`. The initial state and the conditions provided in the precondition do not affect the value being printed because the `print` statement is explicitly printing the string `'10000'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **10000**
