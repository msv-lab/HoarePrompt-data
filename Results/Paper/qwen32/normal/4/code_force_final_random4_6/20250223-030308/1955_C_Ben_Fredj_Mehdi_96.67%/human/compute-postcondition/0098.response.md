Postcondition: **`t` remains the same, `a` has its first `k // 2` non-zero elements and last `k // 2` non-zero elements decremented by 1, `n` remains the same, `k` remains the same and `k` is odd, `g` is incremented each time an element at the start of `a` becomes 0, and `d` is decremented each time an element at the end of `a` becomes 0.**
