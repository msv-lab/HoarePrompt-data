Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers where the first element has been decreased by 1 and the last element has been decreased by 1; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space minus 1; `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space; `k` is at least 2 and not equal to any of the specified forbidden values; `d` is the length of `a` minus 1; `g` is 0 and `a[g]` (which is `a[0]`) is 0.**
