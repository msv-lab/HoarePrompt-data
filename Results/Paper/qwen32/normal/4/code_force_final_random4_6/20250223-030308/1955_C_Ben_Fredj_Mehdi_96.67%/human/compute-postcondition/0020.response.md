Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space; `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space; `k` is not equal to 1999999998, `k` is not equal to 1999999999, and `k` is not equal to 99999999999; it is not the case that (n == 1 and k == 10000000000000 and a[0] == 1); `k` is not equal to 9999999999**
