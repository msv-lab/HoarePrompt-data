Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string with no leading or trailing whitespace, `b` is the input string with no leading or trailing whitespace, `ans` includes the second-to-last character of `a` and the character at index `i` of `b`, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `work` is False, `j` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is the final count based on the conditions in the loop and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
