Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; the first binary string `a_11 a_12 ... a_1n` consists of `n` characters, each of which is either '0' or '1'; the second binary string `a_21 a_22 ... a_2n` consists of `n` characters, each of which is either '0' or '1'; `input` is `sys.stdin.readline`.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is now assigned the integer value read from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The other variables and their preconditions remain unchanged.
