Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string with no leading or trailing whitespace and length at least 2; `b` is the input string with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is a string constructed by alternating between characters from `a` and `b` based on the loop conditions; `i` is equal to `len(a)`; `work` is False; `j` is `len(a) - 1`. If `a[j + 1] == b[j]`, then `counter` is incremented by 1. If `a[j + 1] == '0'` and `b[j] == '1'`, then `counter` is set to 1. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
