Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; the first binary string `a_11 a_12 ... a_1n` consists of `n` characters, each of which is either '0' or '1'; the second binary string `a_21 a_22 ... a_2n` consists of `n` characters, each of which is either '0' or '1'; `input` is `sys.stdin.readline`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    ans = ''
    i = 0
    work = True
    while i < len(a):
        if work:
            ans += a[i]
            if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
                work = False
            elif i + 1 == len(a):
                ans += b[i]
                break
            else:
                i += 1
        else:
            ans += b[i]
            i += 1
    print(ans)
    counter = 1
    for j in range(len(a) - 1):
        if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
            counter += 1
        elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
            counter = 1
        else:
            break
    print(counter)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `a` is a non-empty string with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is a string with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is a string constructed based on the conditions described; `i` is equal to `len(a)`; `work` is a boolean flag that can be either True or False; `j` is `len(a) - 1`; `counter` is the final count based on the conditions in the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; n is an input integer; a is a non-empty string with no leading or trailing whitespace; b is the input string with no leading or trailing whitespace; ans is a string constructed by alternating between characters from a and b based on the loop conditions; i is equal to len(a); work is False; j is len(a) - 1; counter reflects the number of consecutive matches of a[j + 1] and b[j] until the loop breaks or completes.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4, n is an input integer, a is the new input string with no leading or trailing whitespace, b is the updated input string with no leading or trailing whitespace, ans is a string starting with the first character of a followed by characters from b starting from the index where work was set to False or the end of a, i is len(a), work is False, j is len(a) - 2 if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, and counter is incremented by 1 for each iteration where a[j + 1] == b[j]. If the loop breaks, counter reflects the number of successful matches before the break.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
