The code snippet provided initializes a variable `ans` to an empty string. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`. The values of these variables remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is a string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is an empty string.**
