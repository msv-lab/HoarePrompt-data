Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is a string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace. If `work` is True, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` concatenated with `a[i]`. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `work` is set to False. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i] >= a[i + 1]`, then `i` is incremented by 1 and `work` is set to True. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, then `ans` is further concatenated with `b[i]` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `work` is False, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` concatenated with `b[i]` and `i` is incremented by 1. `work` is then determined based on the new value of `i`.**
