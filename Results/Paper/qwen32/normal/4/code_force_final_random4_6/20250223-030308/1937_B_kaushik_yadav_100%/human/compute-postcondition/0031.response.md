Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is a string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is the previous value of `ans` concatenated with `a[i]`; `i` is incremented by 1; `work` is False if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, otherwise `work` is True.**

In simple terms, the value of `i` has been increased by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
