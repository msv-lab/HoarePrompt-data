Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the new input string with no leading or trailing whitespace and `a` is not an empty string; `b` is the updated input string with no leading or trailing whitespace; if `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `work` is False, otherwise `work` is True; if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, then `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a` followed by the first character of `b`, otherwise `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a`; `i` is 0 if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, otherwise `i` is 1; `j` is len(a) - 1; `counter` reflects the number of consecutive matches of `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]` until the loop breaks or completes.**
