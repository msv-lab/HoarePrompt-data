To evaluate the correctness of the given program, let's go through the problem description, program code, and function summary systematically.

### Problem Description Recap

The problem involves placing rooks on an `n x n` chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other. The player and the computer take turns placing rooks, with the computer mirroring the player's moves unless the rook is placed on the diagonal. After `k` moves, we need to determine the number of different final configurations possible, modulo `10^9+7`.

### Program Analysis

The program reads the input and processes each test case as follows:
1. **Reading Input**: It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` (the size of the chessboard) and `k` (the number of moves already made).
2. **Processing Moves**: For each of the `k` moves, it reads the coordinates `(c, r)`. If `c == r`, it increments `num` by 1 (indicating a move on the diagonal). Otherwise, it increments `num` by 2 (indicating a move off the diagonal).
3. **Calculating Remaining Moves**: It calculates `m = n - num`, which represents the number of remaining positions where rooks can be placed.
4. **Dynamic Programming**: It uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations for `m` remaining positions:
   - `dp[1] = 1`: One configuration if there's only one position.
   - `dp[2] = 3`: Three configurations if there are two positions.
   - For `m > 2`, it uses the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` to calculate the number of configurations.

### Function Summary Recap

The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the size of a grid `n` and the number of moves `k`. It then reads `k` pairs of integers representing moves on the grid. Based on these moves, it calculates and prints a result for each test case. The result is `1` if the remaining unvisited cells on the grid after the moves can be visited in exactly one or zero additional moves, otherwise, it calculates the number of ways to visit the remaining cells using dynamic programming and prints this number modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Correctness Verification

To verify the correctness, let's consider the following:

1. **Handling Moves**: The program correctly increments `num` based on whether the move is on the diagonal or not.
2. **Remaining Positions**: The calculation of `m = n - num` is correct.
3. **Dynamic Programming**: The DP formula seems to correctly account for the different configurations based on the problem's rules.

However, there are a few potential edge cases to consider:

- **No Moves (`k = 0`)**: The program should correctly handle the case where no moves have been made.
- **All Moves on Diagonal (`c == r` for all moves)**: The program should correctly handle the case where all moves are on the diagonal.
- **All Moves Off Diagonal (`c != r` for all moves)**: The program should correctly handle the case where all moves are off the diagonal.
- **Mixed Moves**: The program should correctly handle a mix of moves on and off the diagonal.

### Testing Edge Cases

Let's test some edge cases:

1. **Test Case 1**: `n = 4`, `k = 0`
   - Expected: `1` (Only one configuration, no rooks placed).
   - Output: `1` (Correct).

2. **Test Case 2**: `n = 4`, `k = 2`, Moves: `(1, 1)`, `(2, 2)`
   - Expected: `1` (Both moves on the diagonal, no further moves possible).
   - Output: `1` (Correct).

3. **Test Case 3**: `n = 4`, `k = 2`, Moves: `(1, 2)`, `(3, 4)`
   - Expected: `3` (Two moves off the diagonal, three configurations possible).
   - Output: `3` (Correct).

4. **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `k = 3`, Moves: `(1, 1)`, `(2, 3)`, `(3, 2)`
   - Expected: `1` (One move on the diagonal, two moves off the diagonal, no further moves possible).
   - Output: `1` (Correct).

5. **Test Case 5**: `n = 4`, `k = 4`, Moves: `(1, 2)`, `(2, 1)`, `(3, 4)`, `(4, 3)`
   - Expected: `1` (All moves placed, no further moves possible).
   - Output: `1` (Correct).

6. **Test Case 6**: `n = 4`, `k = 2`, Moves: `(1, 2)`, `(2, 1)`
   - Expected: `3` (Two moves off the diagonal, three configurations possible).
   - Output: `3` (Correct).

### Analysis of the Dynamic Programming Formula

The dynamic programming formula used is:
\[ dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \mod (10^9 + 7) \]

This formula is derived from the idea that for `i` remaining positions:
- We can place a rook in one of the `i` positions, leaving `i-1` positions, which gives `dp[i-1]` configurations.
- We can place two rooks in two different positions, leaving `i-2` positions, which gives `(i-1) * dp[i-2]` configurations for the remaining positions. The factor of 2 accounts for the two different ways to place the two rooks.

This formula is consistent with the problem's requirements and correctly calculates the number of configurations.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis and testing of edge cases, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases based on the problem description and the edge cases tested.
