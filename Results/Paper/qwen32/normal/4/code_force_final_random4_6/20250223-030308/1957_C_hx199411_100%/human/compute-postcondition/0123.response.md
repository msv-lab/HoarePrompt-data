To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop progresses and what the final values of the `dp` list will be.

Given:
- `t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input.
- `num` is the total increment based on the `c` and `r` values.
- `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 3.
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3.

The loop iterates from `i = 3` to `i = m` and updates the `dp` list using the formula:
\[ dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \cdot dp[i - 2] \cdot 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]

From the provided output states after the first 3 iterations:
- After 1 iteration (`i = 3`), `dp[3] = 7`.
- After 2 iterations (`i = 4`), `dp[4] = 25`.
- After 3 iterations (`i = 5`), `dp[5] = (dp[4] + 4 * dp[3] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) = (25 + 4 * 7 * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) = (25 + 56) \% (10^9 + 7) = 81`.

Continuing this process until `i = m`:

- For `i = 6`, `dp[6] = (dp[5] + 5 * dp[4] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) = (81 + 5 * 25 * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) = (81 + 250) \% (10^9 + 7) = 331`.
- For `i = 7`, `dp[7] = (dp[6] + 6 * dp[5] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) = (331 + 6 * 81 * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) = (331 + 972) \% (10^9 + 7) = 1303`.

We continue this process until `i = m`. However, since `m` is not explicitly given, we will assume the loop runs until `m` based on the provided pattern.

After all iterations, the `dp` list will be fully populated up to `dp[m]`.

The final output state, thus, will be:
- `t` remains 0.
- `n` and `k` remain the integers obtained from the input.
- `num` remains the total increment based on the `c` and `r` values.
- `m` remains `n - num` and must be at least 3.
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and the rest are calculated based on the loop formula up to `dp[m]`.

Since the exact value of `m` is not provided, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for `dp[m]`. However, the state of the `dp` list will be fully computed up to `dp[m]`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `num` is the total increment based on the `c` and `r` values, `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with `dp[1]` as 1, `dp[2]` as 3, and the rest of the elements calculated up to `dp[m]` using the loop formula.**
