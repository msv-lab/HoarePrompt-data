The code provided initializes a variable `num` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `k` in any way. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 0 to 9,999; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer separated by a space; `num` is 0.**
