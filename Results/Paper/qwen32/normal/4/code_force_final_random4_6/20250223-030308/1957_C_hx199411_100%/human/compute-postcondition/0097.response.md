The code snippet `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads two integers from the input, splits them by space, and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. This means the values of `c` and `r` will be updated based on the input provided.

The initial state mentions that `c` and `r` are integers obtained from the input, but their specific values are not given. After executing the code, `c` and `r` will be updated to the new values provided by the input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`, and `i`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `c` and `r` are new integers obtained from the input, If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 1 and `m` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `num` is 2 and `m` is `n - 2`, `i` is 3.**
