### Reasoning:

The given problem is about determining the number of distinct final configurations of a chessboard after a series of moves, where the computer mirrors your moves unless they are on the diagonal. The program calculates the number of valid configurations based on the number of moves already played and the size of the board.

#### Steps of the Program:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the board `n` and the number of moves `k` already played.
   - It then reads the `k` moves, each represented by a pair of integers `(r_i, c_i)`.

2. **Counting Moves:**
   - It initializes a counter `num` to zero.
   - For each move `(c, r)`, if `c == r`, it increments `num` by 1 (indicating a move on the diagonal, which the computer skips).
   - If `c != r`, it increments `num` by 2 (indicating a move off the diagonal, where the computer mirrors the move).

3. **Calculating Remaining Positions:**
   - It calculates `m` as the remaining number of positions on the board that can still be used, which is `n - num`.

4. **Dynamic Programming Calculation:**
   - If `m` is 0 or 1, it prints 1, as there's only one possible configuration.
   - If `m` is greater than 1, it uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of configurations:
     - It initializes a list `dp` of size `m + 1` with zeros.
     - It sets `dp[1]` to 1 and `dp[2]` to 3.
     - It iterates from 3 to `m`, updating `dp[i]` based on the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
   - Finally, it prints `dp[m]`.

#### Verification:

- **Base Cases:**
  - When `m` is 0 or 1, the number of configurations is indeed 1, as there are no more moves to be made.

- **Dynamic Programming Formula:**
  - The formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is derived from considering the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions. The term `(i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2` accounts for the fact that each new rook can be placed in `i - 1` positions, and for each of these positions, the computer can mirror the move, leading to `2` configurations for each choice.

- **Modulo Operation:**
  - The results are taken modulo `10^9 + 7` to handle large numbers, as required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of distinct final configurations of the chessboard after the initial moves, taking into account the constraints and requirements of the problem.

**Correctness: True**
