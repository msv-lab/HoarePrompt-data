The code snippet `dp[2] = 3` updates the element at index 2 of the `dp` list to the value 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `num` is the sum of increments from all iterations (either 1 or 2 per iteration), `m` is `n - num`, `m` is not equal to 0, and `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3.**
