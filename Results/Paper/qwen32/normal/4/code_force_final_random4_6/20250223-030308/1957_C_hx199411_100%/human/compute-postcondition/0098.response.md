The code `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. Given the initial conditions, if `c` equals `r`, `num` was initially 1 and is now 2. If `c` does not equal `r`, `num` was initially 2 and is now 3. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, `r`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `c` and `r` are new integers obtained from the input, If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 2 and `m` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `num` is 3 and `m` is `n - 2`, `i` is 3.**
