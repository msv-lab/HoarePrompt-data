The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input where `k` must be greater than 0, `num` is 0, `m` is equal to `n - num`, `c` and `r` are integers obtained from the input.**
