Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `num` is the sum of increments from all iterations (either 1 or 2 per iteration), `m` is `n - num`, `m` is not equal to 0, and `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `dp[1]` has been changed to 1, while all other variables retain their initial values or conditions as described.
