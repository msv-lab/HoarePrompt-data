Postcondition: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `num` is the total increment based on the `c` and `r` values, `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is equal to 0, no changes are made to `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, or `m`. If `m` is 1, no changes are made to `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, or `m`. If `m` is greater than 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with `dp[1]` as 1, `dp[2]` as 3, and the rest of the elements calculated up to `dp[m]` using the loop formula.**

This postcondition summarizes the behavior of the if-else block by detailing the state of the variables after the execution of the block, considering all possible cases for the value of `m`.
