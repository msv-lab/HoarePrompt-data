The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the range is defined by `k`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `k` must be greater than 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `num`, `m`, `dp`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

For the loop to execute, `k` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input where `k` must be greater than 0, `num` is 0, `m` is equal to `n - num`**
