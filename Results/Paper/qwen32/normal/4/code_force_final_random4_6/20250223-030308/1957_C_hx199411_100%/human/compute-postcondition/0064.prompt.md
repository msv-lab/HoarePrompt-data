Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer separated by a space; `num` is 0; `m` is equal to `n - num`. If `m` is 0, the program does not change `i` and `m`. If `m` is not 0, `i` is set to `k` unless `m` is 1, in which case `i` is set to 10. If `m` is at least 10, `dp` is a list with `m + 1` elements, all initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, `dp[5]` which is 81, `dp[6]` which is 331, `dp[7]` which is 1303, `dp[8]` which is 5937, `dp[9]` which is 26785, and `dp[10]` which is 133651.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    if c == r:
        num += 1
    else:
        num += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input where `k` is greater than 0, `num` is either 1 or 2, `m` is equal to `n - num`, `c` and `r` are integers obtained from the input, and `c` is equal to `r` if `num` is 1, otherwise `c` is not equal to `r`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input where `k` is greater than 0, `num` is either 2 or 3 or 4, `m` is equal to `n - num`, `c` and `r` are integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 2 or 3. Otherwise, `num` is 3 or 4.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input where `k` is greater than 0, `num` is either 3, 4, 5, or 6, `m` is equal to `n - num`, `c` and `r` are new integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is either 3, 4, or 5. Otherwise, `num` is either 4, 5, or 6.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
