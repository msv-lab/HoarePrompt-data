The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `k`. Since the loop is defined as `for i in range(k):`, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and should still be less than `k`.

State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `c` and `r` are new integers obtained from the input. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 2 and `m` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `num` is 4 and `m` is `n - 2`. `i` is 4**
