To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the initial state and how the loop modifies the variables `num` and `m` based on the values of `c` and `r` obtained from the input.

### Summary of the Loop's Effect:
- The loop runs `k` times.
- For each iteration, it reads a pair of integers `c` and `r`.
- If `c` equals `r`, `num` is incremented by 1.
- If `c` does not equal `r`, `num` is incremented by 2.
- `m` is calculated as `n - num`.

### Output State after All Iterations:
- The loop runs `k` times, so `i` will be `k` after the loop finishes.
- `num` will be the sum of `1` for each iteration where `c == r` and `2` for each iteration where `c != r`.
- `m` will be `n - num`.

### Final Output State:
- `t` remains 0.
- `n` and `k` remain as integers obtained from the input.
- `num` is the total increment based on the `c` and `r` values.
- `m` is `n - num`.

### Natural Language Description:
After all iterations of the loop, the state is as follows:
- `t` is still 0.
- `n` and `k` remain unchanged from the input.
- `num` is the total count where each match (`c == r`) adds 1 to `num` and each mismatch (`c != r`) adds 2 to `num`.
- `m` is recalculated as `n - num`.

### Final Output State in Required Format:
Output State: **t is 0, n and k are integers obtained from the input, num is the total increment based on the c and r values, m is n - num.**
