Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The function `func_15` is intended to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case, but the logic inside this function is incorrect for the problem at hand.

The condition given in the problem is that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This is not what `func_15` is implementing. Instead, `func_15` seems to be implementing a different logic related to divisors and sums, which does not match the problem's requirement.

To solve the problem correctly, one would need to iterate over possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\). This can be optimized using properties of divisors and the greatest common divisor, but the current implementation does not do this.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem.
