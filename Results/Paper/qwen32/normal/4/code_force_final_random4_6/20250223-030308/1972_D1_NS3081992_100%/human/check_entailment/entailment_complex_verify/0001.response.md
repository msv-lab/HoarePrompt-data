### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

From the condition \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), we can derive that \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b\). Let \(a = kb\), then:
\[ kb + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(kb, b) \]
\[ (k + 1)b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(k, 1) \]
\[ k + 1 = k \]
This simplifies to \(a = kb\) where \(k\) is an integer such that \(kb \leq n\).

Thus, for each \(b\), the number of valid \(a\) values is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{b} \right\rfloor\).

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program contains several utility functions, but the relevant function for solving the problem is `func_15`:

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

This function does not correctly implement the solution. Here's why:

1. The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` is not directly related to counting valid pairs \((a, b)\).
2. The expression `(n + i) // (i * i)` does not directly count the number of multiples of \(b\) up to \(n\).

The correct approach would be to iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\) and for each \(b\), count the multiples of \(b\) up to \(n\):

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    ans = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        ans += n // b
    return ans
```

This correctly counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct in stating that the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_15` is flawed, and the program does not iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) to check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Final:
Final: **False**
