### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not solve the problem as described. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The problem requires counting ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for some integer \(k\).
   - This implies \(a = (k - 1) \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), meaning \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program consists of multiple functions, but only `func_16` and `func_15` are relevant for solving the problem.
   - `func_16` reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it calls `func_15` and prints the result.
   - `func_15` reads \(n\) and \(m\), initializes `ans` to 0, and iterates over possible values of \(i\) from 1 to \(\min(m, \sqrt{n + i})\). For each \(i\), it adds \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to `ans`, and finally returns `ans - 1`.

3. **Correctness**:
   - The logic in `func_15` does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It does not iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Instead, it seems to be trying to count divisors in a different context, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.
   - The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\) and for each \(b\), counting the multiples of \(b\) up to \(n\). This can be done efficiently by iterating over the divisors of numbers up to \(n\) and counting valid pairs.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness is:

**Final: False**
