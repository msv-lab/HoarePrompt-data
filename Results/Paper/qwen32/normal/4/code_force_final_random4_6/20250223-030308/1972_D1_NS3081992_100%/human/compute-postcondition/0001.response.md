The provided code snippet writes the string representation of the return value of `func_15()` to the standard output, followed by a newline character.

Since the code does not modify the variables `n` and `m`, their values remain unchanged. The function `func_15()` is called, and its return value is printed. However, the details of `func_15()` are not provided, so we cannot determine the specific value it returns. We only know that it must return a positive integer based on the precondition.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, and a positive integer value from `func_15()` has been returned and printed.**
