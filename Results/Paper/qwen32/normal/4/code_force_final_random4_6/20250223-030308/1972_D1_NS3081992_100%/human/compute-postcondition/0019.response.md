Postcondition: **`d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `d[da]` has at least 3 elements, `processing` is a list of integers, `da` is an integer, `rank` is a list of integers, and `tmp` is the minimum of its previous value and `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` if `processing[di - 1]` is 0. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 1000000000. If `processing[di - 1]` is 0, then `processing[di - 1]` is now 0. `di` is the next element in `d[da]`.**
