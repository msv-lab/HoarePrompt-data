### Reasoning:
The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's analyze the provided functions to see if they collectively meet the problem requirements:

1. **Input Reading Functions**: 
   - `func_1` reads a single integer.
   - `func_2` reads a line of integers and returns them as a map object.
   - `func_3` reads a line of integers and returns them as a list.
   - `func_4` reads multiple lines of integers and returns them as a list of lists.
   - `func_5` reads a line and removes trailing whitespace.
   - `func_6` reads a line, removes trailing whitespace, and decodes it.
   - `func_7` reads a line, splits it by spaces, and converts each to an integer.
   - `func_8` reads multiple lines, each split into integers, and returns them as a list of lists.
   - `func_9` reads a line of input.
   - `func_10` reads a single integer input.
   - `func_11` reads a line and splits it by whitespace into a list of strings.

2. **Helper Functions**:
   - `func_12` is related to some graph processing, not relevant to the problem.
   - `func_13` calculates the GCD of two numbers and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity. This is relevant for the problem.
   - `func_14` is not related to the problem.
   - `func_15` calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).
   - `func_16` orchestrates reading the number of test cases and applying `func_15` to each pair of \(n\) and \(m\).

The core of the solution is in `func_15`, which uses the mathematical property that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This function iterates through possible values of \(j\) and accumulates the count of valid pairs.

`func_16` correctly orchestrates the reading of test cases and applies `func_15` to each pair of \(n\) and \(m\).

### Verification:
- The provided `func_15` correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).
- `func_16` correctly handles multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.
- The other functions are either input handling functions or unrelated to the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as all functions together meet the problem description and correctly solve the problem as per the provided execution summaries.

**Correctness: True**
