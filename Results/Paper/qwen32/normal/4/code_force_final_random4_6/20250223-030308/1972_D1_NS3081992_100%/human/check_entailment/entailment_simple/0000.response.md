### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's analyze the key parts of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases.
   - `func_7()` reads the values of \(n\) and \(m\) for each test case.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The main function `func_16()` iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_15()` which contains the core logic to compute the number of valid pairs.

3. **Core Logic in `func_15()`:**
   - It initializes `ans` to 0.
   - It iterates over `i` starting from 1 up to the smallest integer such that \(i \cdot i > n + i\) or \(i > m\).
   - For each `i`, it increments `ans` by \((n + i) // (i \cdot i)\).
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

The logic in `func_15()` appears to be based on the observation that for a given `i`, the number of valid pairs \((a, i)\) can be counted by checking the condition \(a + i = k \cdot (i \cdot \gcd(a, i))\), which simplifies to \((n + i) // (i \cdot i)\) for the range of `a`.

4. **Output:**
   - The result of `func_15()` for each test case is written to the standard output.

### Analysis of the Provided Code:

- The code correctly reads the input and iterates over each test case.
- The logic in `func_15()` seems to be an optimized way to count the pairs based on the mathematical properties of the problem.
- The function `func_15()` is called for each test case, and the results are printed correctly.

### Conclusion:

The provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the logic implemented. The core logic in `func_15()` seems to be mathematically sound and optimized for the given constraints.

### Correctness:

**Correctness: True**
