In the given loop, the loop variable is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not intend to use within the loop body. The loop will execute `func_10()` times. Since the loop variable `_` is not used, we only need to consider the state of `func_10()` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given that `func_10()` must return a value of at least 1, and considering that at the end of the previous iteration, `func_15()` has been called and its value returned and printed, we need to adjust the state such that `func_10()` will return a value that allows the loop to execute one more iteration.

Since `func_10()` dictates the number of iterations, and we are at the start of the next iteration, `func_10()` should return a value that is one less than it did in the previous iteration for the loop to continue executing.

However, since we do not have the exact value that `func_10()` returned in the previous iteration, we can only infer that for the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must return a positive integer. Given that `func_10()` must return a value of at least 1, and we are now at the start of the next iteration, we can assume that `func_10()` will return a value that is decremented by 1 from the previous iteration.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, and a positive integer value from `func_15()` has been returned and printed, and `func_10()` must return a value of at least 1**.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, we adjust the state of `func_10()` to reflect that it will return a value that allows for one more iteration:
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, and a positive integer value from `func_15()` has been returned and printed, and `func_10()` must return a value of at least 2**.
