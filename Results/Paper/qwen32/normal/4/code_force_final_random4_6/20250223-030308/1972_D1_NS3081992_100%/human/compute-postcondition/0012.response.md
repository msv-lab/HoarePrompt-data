To determine the final output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables `i` and `ans` evolve.

The loop continues to execute while the following conditions are met:
1. `i <= m`
2. `i * i <= n + i`

In each iteration, the value of `ans` is updated by adding `(n + i) // (i * i)` to it, and `i` is incremented by 1.

Given the output states after the first three iterations, we can observe the pattern:
- After the 1st iteration, `i` is 2, and `ans` is `n + 1`.
- After the 2nd iteration, `i` is 3, and `ans` is `n + 2`.
- After the 3rd iteration, `i` is 4, and `ans` is `(n + 2) + ((n + 3) // 9)`.

This pattern suggests that the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `m` and `i * i` is less than or equal to `n + i`. The value of `ans` accumulates the integer division of `(n + i)` by `(i * i)` for each valid iteration.

To find the final output state, we need to iterate through the loop until the conditions are no longer satisfied. However, without specific values for `n` and `m`, we can describe the final state in terms of `n` and `m`.

The loop will terminate when either `i > m` or `i * i > n + i`. The final value of `ans` will be the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all valid iterations.

Given the initial state and the loop behavior, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **`i` is the smallest integer greater than `m` or the smallest integer such that `i * i > n + i`, and `ans` is the sum of `(n + j) // (j * j)` for all integers `j` from 1 to `i-1`.**

In simpler terms, the loop runs as long as `i` is within the bounds defined by `m` and the condition `i * i <= n + i`. The final value of `ans` is the accumulated sum of the integer divisions calculated in each iteration.
