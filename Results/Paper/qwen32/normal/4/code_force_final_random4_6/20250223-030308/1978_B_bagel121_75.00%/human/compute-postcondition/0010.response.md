Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the program does not modify `a` or `b`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `b`, `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`, and `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.**
