### Reasoning:
The problem requires us to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns. The profit calculation depends on whether Bob sells some of the buns at a modified price or all at the usual price.

Here's the breakdown of the logic in the provided program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads `t`, the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of buns), `a` (usual price of a bun), and `b` (price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price).

2. **Decision Making:**
   - If `a >= b`, it means that the usual price is greater than or equal to the modified price for the first bun. In this case, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a` to maximize profit. The profit is simply `n * a`.
   - If `a < b`, Bob should consider selling some of the buns at the modified price to maximize profit:
     - The maximum number of buns he can sell at the modified price is `min(b - a + 1, n)`. This is because the price of the `i`-th bun in the promotion is `(b - i + 1)`, and it will be less than or equal to `a` when `i > b - a + 1`.
     - The profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
     - The profit from selling the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a` is `(n - k) * a`.
     - The total profit is the sum of the two profits calculated above.

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the maximum profit.

### Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided example test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `n = 4, a = 4, b = 5`
   - Since `a < b`, calculate `k = min(5 - 4 + 1, 4) = 2`.
   - Profit from first 2 buns: `int((5 + (5 - 2 + 1)) / 2 * 2) = int((5 + 4) / 2 * 2) = int(9 / 2 * 2) = int(4.5 * 2) = 9`.
   - Profit from remaining 2 buns: `(4 - 2) * 4 = 2 * 4 = 8`.
   - Total profit: `9 + 8 = 17`.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `n = 5, a = 5, b = 9`
   - Since `a < b`, calculate `k = min(9 - 5 + 1, 5) = 5`.
   - Profit from first 5 buns: `int((9 + (9 - 5 + 1)) / 2 * 5) = int((9 + 5) / 2 * 5) = int(7 * 5) = 35`.
   - Profit from remaining 0 buns: `(5 - 5) * 5 = 0 * 5 = 0`.
   - Total profit: `35 + 0 = 35`.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `n = 10, a = 10, b = 5`
   - Since `a >= b`, profit is `10 * 10 = 100`.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `n = 5, a = 5, b = 11`
   - Since `a < b`, calculate `k = min(11 - 5 + 1, 5) = 5`.
   - Profit from first 5 buns: `int((11 + (11 - 5 + 1)) / 2 * 5) = int((11 + 7) / 2 * 5) = int(9 * 5) = 45`.
   - Profit from remaining 0 buns: `(5 - 5) * 5 = 0 * 5 = 0`.
   - Total profit: `45 + 0 = 45`.

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `n = 1000000000, a = 1000000000, b = 1000000000`
   - Since `a >= b`, profit is `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`.

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input: `n = 1000000000, a = 1000000000, b = 1`
   - Since `a >= b`, profit is `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`.

7. **Test Case 7:**
   - Input: `n = 1000, a = 1, b = 1000`
   - Since `a < b`, calculate `k = min(1000 - 1 + 1, 1000) = 1000`.
   - Profit from first 1000 buns: `int((1000 + (1000 - 1000 + 1)) / 2 * 1000) = int((1000 + 1) / 2 * 1000) = int(500.5 * 1000) = 500500`.
   - Profit from remaining 0 buns: `(1000 - 1000) * 1 = 0 * 1 = 0`.
   - Total profit: `500500 + 0 = 500500`.

The program correctly computes the maximum profit for all the provided test cases.
