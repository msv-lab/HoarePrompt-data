### Reasoning:

The provided Python function aims to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain from selling his buns based on the given conditions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of buns), `a` (usual price of a bun), and `b` (price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price).

2. **Decision Making:**
   - If `a` (usual price) is greater than or equal to `b` (modified price for the first bun), the best strategy for Bob is to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. This is because the modified price is not beneficial.
   - If `a` is less than `b`, Bob should consider selling some buns at the modified price to maximize profit. The number of buns sold at the modified price, `k`, is determined as the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`. This is because the modified price decreases by 1 for each subsequent bun sold under this promotion, so the benefit of the promotion reduces after `b - a + 1` buns.

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - If `a >= b`, the profit is simply `n * a`.
   - If `a < b`, the profit is calculated in two parts:
     - The profit from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price: This is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
     - The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price `a`: This is `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the calculated profit for each test case.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1:** `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
  - Since `a < b`, the optimal `k` is `min(5 - 4 + 1, 4) = 2`.
  - Profit from first `k` buns: `int((5 + (5 - 2 + 1)) / 2 * 2) = int((5 + 4) / 2 * 2) = 9`.
  - Profit from remaining `n - k` buns: `(4 - 2) * 4 = 8`.
  - Total profit: `9 + 8 = 17`.

- **Test Case 2:** `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `a < b`, the optimal `k` is `min(9 - 5 + 1, 5) = 5`.
  - Profit from first `k` buns: `int((9 + (9 - 5 + 1)) / 2 * 5) = int((9 + 5) / 2 * 5) = 35`.
  - Profit from remaining `n - k` buns: `(5 - 5) * 5 = 0`.
  - Total profit: `35 + 0 = 35`.

- **Test Case 3:** `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
  - Since `a >= b`, the optimal strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price.
  - Profit: `10 * 10 = 100`.

- **Test Case 4:** `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Since `a < b`, the optimal `k` is `min(11 - 5 + 1, 5) = 5`.
  - Profit from first `k` buns: `int((11 + (11 - 5 + 1)) / 2 * 5) = int((11 + 7) / 2 * 5) = 45`.
  - Profit from remaining `n - k` buns: `(5 - 5) * 5 = 0`.
  - Total profit: `45 + 0 = 45`.

- **Test Case 5:** `n = 1000000000`, `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1000000000`
  - Since `a >= b`, the optimal strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price.
  - Profit: `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`.

- **Test Case 6:** `n = 1000000000`, `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1`
  - Since `a >= b`, the optimal strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price.
  - Profit: `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`.

- **Test Case 7:** `n = 1000`, `a = 1`, `b = 1000`
  - Since `a < b`, the optimal `k` is `min(1000 - 1 + 1, 1000) = 1000`.
  - Profit from first `k` buns: `int((1000 + (1000 - 1000 + 1)) / 2 * 1000) = int((1000 + 1) / 2 * 1000) = 500500`.
  - Profit from remaining `n - k` buns: `(1000 - 1000) * 1 = 0`.
  - Total profit: `500500 + 0 = 500500`.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit for each test case. It handles all the given example test cases accurately.

**Correctness:** **True**
