Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n`, `a`, and `b` are each integers between 1 and 10^9, and there are `t` test cases, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the integer input, which represents the number of test cases. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain as specified in the initial state, as they have not been modified by the code snippet provided.
