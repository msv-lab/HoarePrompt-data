To determine the output of the print statement `print(ans + p2)`, we need to break down the calculations and understand the values of `ans` and `p2` based on the given initial state.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `t` is an integer greater than 1 (though `t` is not used in the given code snippet, it is part of the initial state).
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
   - `k` is calculated as the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
   - `ans` is calculated using the formula: `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
   - `p2` is calculated as: `(n - k) * a`.

2. **Calculation of `k`:**
   - `k = min(b - a + 1, n)`.
   - This means `k` is the smaller value between the number of integers from `a` to `b` (inclusive) and `n`.

3. **Calculation of `ans`:**
   - `ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
   - This formula calculates the sum of the `k` largest integers in the range from `a` to `b` (inclusive).

4. **Calculation of `p2`:**
   - `p2 = (n - k) * a`.
   - This formula calculates the sum of the smallest `n - k` integers in the range, each being `a`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the sum of `ans` and `p2`.

### Putting It All Together:

- **`k`**: The smaller value between the number of integers from `a` to `b` (inclusive) and `n`.
- **`ans`**: The sum of the `k` largest integers from `a` to `b`.
- **`p2`**: The sum of the smallest `n - k` integers, each being `a`.

### Example Calculation:

Let's assume `n = 5`, `a = 2`, and `b = 6` for a concrete example:
- `k = min(6 - 2 + 1, 5) = min(5, 5) = 5`.
- `ans = int((6 + (6 - 5 + 1)) / 2 * 5) = int((6 + 2) / 2 * 5) = int(8 / 2 * 5) = int(4 * 5) = 20`.
- `p2 = (5 - 5) * 2 = 0`.
- `ans + p2 = 20 + 0 = 20`.

### General Case:

The final output of `print(ans + p2)` will be the sum of the `k` largest integers from `a` to `b` and the sum of the smallest `n - k` integers, each being `a`.

### Final Answer:

Output: **ans + p2 (where ans is the sum of the k largest integers from a to b, and p2 is (n - k) * a)**
