To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the given information and the code:

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is an integer greater than 0.
  - `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.

- **Code Snippet:**
  ```python
  print(n * a)
  ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `t` is not used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
- `n` and `a` are integers that have been read from the input, and their exact values are not provided. However, we know they are integers.

The `print` statement calculates the product of `n` and `a` and prints the result.

Given that we do not have the specific values of `n` and `a`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **n * a (where n and a are integers read from the input)**
