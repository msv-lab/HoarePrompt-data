To ensure the for loop executes, we need to focus on the variable `t`, which determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Given the loop statement:
```
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The underscore `_` is a conventional way to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body, so we don't need to specify its initial value.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are each integers between 1 and 10^9, and there are `t` test cases, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4**
