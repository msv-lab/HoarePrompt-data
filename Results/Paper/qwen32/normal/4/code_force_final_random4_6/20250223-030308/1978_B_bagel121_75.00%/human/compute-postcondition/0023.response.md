The code calculates the value of `ans` based on the provided formula. Let's break down the calculation step by step.

The formula given is:
```
ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
```

Let's simplify the expression inside the `int` function:
1. `(b - k + 1)` is the starting point of the sequence.
2. `(b + (b - k + 1))` is the sum of the first and last term of the sequence.
3. `((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2)` is the average of the first and last term.
4. Multiplying the average by `k` gives the sum of the sequence from `b` to `b - k + 1`.

Since `k` is defined as the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, the value of `k` remains unchanged by this calculation. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` also remain unchanged.

The only variable that changes is `ans`, which is assigned the result of the above calculation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input; `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`; `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`**.
