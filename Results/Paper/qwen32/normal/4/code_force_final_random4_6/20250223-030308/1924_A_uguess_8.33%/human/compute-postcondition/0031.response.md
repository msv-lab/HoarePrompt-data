The given initial state describes several variables and their relationships, but the specific values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, and `cur` are not explicitly provided. However, the print statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of these variables.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This print statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, and `cur`.

Thus, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **YES**
