The provided code snippet modifies the value of the variable `cur` by adding `1 << cur_ss` to it. Here, `cur_ss` is the integer value representing the 0-based index of the character `ss` in the alphabet.

Given the initial state, `cur` can either be `(1 << k) - 1` or `0`. The operation `cur += 1 << cur_ss` will change the value of `cur` based on the value of `cur_ss`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are the input integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is `i + 1`, `ss` is the next character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the integer value representing the 0-based index of `ss` in the alphabet, `cur` is `(1 << k) - 1 + (1 << cur_ss)` if `cur` was previously `(1 << k) - 1`, or `0 + (1 << cur_ss)` if `cur` was previously `0`, `cnt` is 1, `tmp` is the `k`-th letter in the alphabet, `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times concatenated with `tmp` and then 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.**
