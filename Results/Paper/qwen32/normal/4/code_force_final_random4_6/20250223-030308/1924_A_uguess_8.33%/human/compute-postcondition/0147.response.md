The code snippet `ans += tmp` appends the value of `tmp` to the string `ans`. Given that `tmp` is the character `chr(ord('a') + (k-1))`, and `ans` is initially a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times, after the operation, `ans` will include the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt + 1` times. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` are the input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered consecutively, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is the character `chr(ord('a') + (k-1))`, and `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt + 1` times.**
