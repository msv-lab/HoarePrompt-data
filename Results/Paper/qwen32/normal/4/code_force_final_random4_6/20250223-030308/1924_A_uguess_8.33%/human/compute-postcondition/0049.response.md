To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the description of the variables involved.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\).
- `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers.
- `s` is the input string.
- `cnt` is the number of times a sequence of `k` distinct characters was encountered in `s` and `cnt` is less than `n`.
- `cur` is the bitmask of characters encountered in the final segment of `s` that did not complete a sequence of `k` distinct characters.
- `i` is `k-1`.
- `tmp` is determined based on the `i`-th bit of `cur`. If the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0, `tmp` is the `k`-th letter in the alphabet. Otherwise, `tmp` remains the last valid character assigned.
- `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times concatenated with `tmp` and then 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `cnt`:** This is the number of times a sequence of `k` distinct characters was encountered in `s` and it is less than `n`. The exact value of `cnt` is not specified but it is known to be less than `n`.
2. **Determine `cur`:** This is a bitmask representing characters encountered in the final segment of `s` that did not complete a sequence of `k` distinct characters. The exact value of `cur` is not provided.
3. **Determine `tmp`:** This depends on the `i`-th bit of `cur`. If the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0, `tmp` is the `k`-th letter in the alphabet. Otherwise, `tmp` remains the last valid character assigned. Without the exact value of `cur`, we can't determine `tmp` precisely, but we can describe it based on the condition.
4. **Determine `ans`:** The string `ans` is constructed as:
   - The `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times.
   - Concatenated with `tmp`.
   - Followed by 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.

### Final Output Description:
Given the conditions and the structure of `ans`, the output can be described as:
- The `k`-th letter in the alphabet is `chr(96 + k)` (since 'a' is 97 in ASCII).
- This letter is repeated `cnt` times.
- Followed by `tmp` (which is either the `k`-th letter in the alphabet or the last valid character assigned based on the `i`-th bit of `cur`).
- Followed by 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.

Thus, the output will be a string that starts with the `k`-th letter repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp`, and then 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.

### Final Output:
Output: **the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp`, and then 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times (where the `k`-th letter is `chr(96 + k)`, `tmp` is the `k`-th letter if the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise it is the last valid character assigned, and `cnt` is the number of sequences of `k` distinct characters encountered in `s` that is less than `n`)**
