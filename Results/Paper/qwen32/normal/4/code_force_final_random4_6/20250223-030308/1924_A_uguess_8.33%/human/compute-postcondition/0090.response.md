The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and since the loop is iterating from `0` to `k-1`, `i` must have been incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that `i` ranges from `0` to `k-1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` are input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` and `cnt` is less than `n`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.** 

Since we are only adjusting `i`:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` are input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` and `cnt` is less than `n`, `i` is 4 (assuming `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, as an example)**

To generalize:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` are input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` and `cnt` is less than `n`, `i` is `i + 1`**
