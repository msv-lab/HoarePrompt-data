The given code snippet only modifies the variable `cnt` by incrementing it by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 1, `i` is 0, `cur_ss` is the zero-based index of `s[next_index]` in the alphabet, `ss` is `s[next_index]`. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is its previous value plus `2^cur_ss`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.**
