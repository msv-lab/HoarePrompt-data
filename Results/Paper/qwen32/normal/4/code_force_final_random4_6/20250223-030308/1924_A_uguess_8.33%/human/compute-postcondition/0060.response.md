Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 0, `cur_ss` is the zero-based index of the character `ss` in the alphabet. If the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0, then `cur` is updated to `1 << cur_ss` and `tmp` is set to the `k`-th letter in the alphabet. `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times concatenated with `tmp` and then 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times. Otherwise, the values of `cur` and `tmp` remain unchanged.**
