The code snippet provided initializes the variable `cur` to 0. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `ss`, `cur_ss`, or `cnt`. Therefore, the only change is the value of `cur`, which is now 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.), `cur` is 0, `cnt` is incremented by 1.**
