To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop processes each character in the string `s`.

The loop iterates over each character `ss` in the string `s`. For each character, it calculates `cur_ss` as `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, which represents the position of the character in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.). 

The variable `cur` is a bitmask where each bit represents whether a particular character from 'a' to 'z' has been encountered. If the `cur_ss`-th bit in `cur` is not set (`cur & (1 << cur_ss) == 0`), it sets the `cur_ss`-th bit (`cur += 1 << cur_ss`).

The variable `cnt` counts how many times all `k` distinct characters (from 'a' to 'z' based on the value of `k`) have been encountered in sequence. When `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, it means that all `k` distinct characters have been encountered, so `cnt` is incremented by 1 and `cur` is reset to 0.

After processing all characters in the string `s`, the final values of `cnt` and `cur` will reflect how many times the sequence of `k` distinct characters was encountered and the state of the bitmask at the end of the string.

Given the initial state and the loop logic, the final output state can be described as follows:

- `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `n`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are input values and not modified within the loop.
- `s` remains unchanged as it is the input string being iterated over.
- `cnt` will be the number of times a sequence of `k` distinct characters was encountered in the string `s`.
- `cur` will be the bitmask representing the characters encountered in the final segment of the string that did not complete a sequence of `k` distinct characters.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the number of times a sequence of `k` distinct characters was encountered in `s`, `cur` is the bitmask of characters encountered in the final segment of `s` that did not complete a sequence of `k` distinct characters.**
