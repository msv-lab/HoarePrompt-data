The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` modifies the value of `cur` by adding to it the result of `1` left-shifted by `cur_ss` bits. This operation effectively sets the bit at position `cur_ss` in the binary representation of `cur` to 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 0 or 1, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet, `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`**.
