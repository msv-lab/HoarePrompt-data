Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` are the input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered consecutively, `cur` is 0, `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. If `cur & 1 << i == 0`, `tmp` is set to the character corresponding to `chr(ord('a') + i)`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains as defined. `ans` remains as defined.**
