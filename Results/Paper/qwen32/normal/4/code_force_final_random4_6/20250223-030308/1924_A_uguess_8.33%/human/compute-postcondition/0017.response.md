The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments the value of `cur` by `1 << cur_ss`. Given that `cur_ss` is calculated as `ord(s[1]) - ord('a')`, the value of `1 << cur_ss` is a bit shift operation which sets the bit at position `cur_ss` to 1 and all other bits to 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty input string, `cur_ss` is `ord(s[1]) - ord('a')`. If `cur` was originally equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is set to 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0. `cur` is now `cur` plus `1 << cur_ss`. `ss` is the second character of `s`.**

In simpler terms, `cur` has been updated by adding `1 << cur_ss` to its original value. All other variables retain their original values.
