The code snippet calculates the zero-based index of the character `ss` in the alphabet by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the ASCII value of `ss`. This will update the value of `cur_ss`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 0 or 1, `i` is 0, `cur_ss` is the zero-based index of `s[next_index]` in the alphabet, `ss` is `s[next_index]`**.

In simpler terms, the value of `cur_ss` is now the zero-based index of the character `ss` in the alphabet, while all other variables remain unchanged.
