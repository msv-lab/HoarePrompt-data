Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `m` are input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the number of times a sequence of `k` distinct characters was encountered in `s` and `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` is the bitmask of characters encountered in the final segment of `s` that did not complete a sequence of `k` distinct characters, and the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0, `tmp` is the string 'a', `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times, `i` is 0**.

In natural language: The value of `tmp` has been updated to 'a' because `chr(ord('a') + i)` evaluates to 'a' when `i` is 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
