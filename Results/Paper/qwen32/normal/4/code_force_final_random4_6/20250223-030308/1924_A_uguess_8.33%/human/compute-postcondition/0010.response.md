Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty input string, `cnt` is 0. If the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` was originally zero, then `cur` is updated to `1 << cur_ss`, and the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is now set. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged and the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is already non-zero. `cur_ss` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`.**
