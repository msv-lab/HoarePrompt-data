The given code snippet updates the value of `ans` by comparing its current value with the sum of `a[i]` and `suff[i + 1]`. Given the initial state where `i` is -1, we can calculate the new value of `ans`.

Here's the calculation:
- `i` is -1.
- `a[i]` will be `a[-1]`, which is the last element of list `a`.
- `suff[i + 1]` will be `suff[0]`, which is the sum of all elements in list `c` (from `c[0]` to `c[n-1]`).

So, `ans` will be updated to the minimum of its current value (`float('inf')`) and the value of `a[-1] + suff[0]`.

Since `ans` was initially `float('inf')`, it will be updated to `a[-1] + suff[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 200,000`, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1` where `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[i]` to `c[n-1]` for `0 <= i < n` and `suff[n]` remains 0, `i` is -1, `ans` is `a[-1] + suff[0]`**.
