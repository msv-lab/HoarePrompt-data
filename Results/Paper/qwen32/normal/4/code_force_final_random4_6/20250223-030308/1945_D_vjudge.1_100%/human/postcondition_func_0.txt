The function `func_1` takes four parameters: two integers `n` and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b` of length `n`. It computes and prints the minimum value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` from `0` to `k-1`, where `suff[i]` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` from index `i` to `n-1`.
