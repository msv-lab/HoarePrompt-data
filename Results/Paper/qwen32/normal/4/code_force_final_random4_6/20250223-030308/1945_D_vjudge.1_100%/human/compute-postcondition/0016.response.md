Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 200,000`; `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`; `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`; `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1` where `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[i]` to `c[n-1]` for `0 <= i < n` and `suff[n]` remains 0; `i` is `k-1`; `ans` is the minimum value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` from `0` to `k-1`.**

In simple terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations up to `k` times, the variable `i` will be `k-1`, and `ans` will hold the smallest value found by adding each element `a[i]` to the corresponding suffix sum `suff[i + 1]` for all indices `i` from `0` to `k-1`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `suff`) remain unchanged as per their initial states.
