Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 200,000`, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1` where `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[i]` to `c[n-1]` for `0 <= i < n` and `suff[n]` remains 0, `i` is -1.**

In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the `suff` list will contain the cumulative sums of the `c` list in reverse order, starting from the end of the `c` list. Specifically, `suff[i]` will be the sum of the elements from `c[i]` to `c[n-1]` for each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, and `suff[n]` will remain `0`. The loop variable `i` will have decremented to `-1`, indicating that the loop has finished executing. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `c`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
