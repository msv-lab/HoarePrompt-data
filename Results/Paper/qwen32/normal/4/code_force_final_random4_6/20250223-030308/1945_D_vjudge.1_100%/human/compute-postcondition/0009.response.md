The code snippet assigns the value `float('inf')` to the variable `ans`. This means `ans` is now set to positive infinity. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 200,000`, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1` where `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[i]` to `c[n-1]` for `0 <= i < n` and `suff[n]` remains 0, `i` is -1, `ans` is `float('inf')`.**
