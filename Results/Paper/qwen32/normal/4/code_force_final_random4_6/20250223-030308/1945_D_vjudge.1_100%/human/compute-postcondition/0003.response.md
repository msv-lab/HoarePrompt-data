The given code snippet modifies the `suff` list based on the values of the `c` list. Specifically, it updates `suff[i]` to be the sum of `suff[i + 1]` and `c[i]`. This means that each element of `suff` from index `i` to `n-1` will be updated to reflect the cumulative sum from `c[i]` to `c[n-1]` in reverse order.

Given the initial state where `suff` is initialized to all zeros, after executing the code snippet, `suff[i]` will hold the sum of `c[i]` to `c[n-1]`. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 200,000`, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1` where `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[i]` to `c[n-1]` for `0 <= i < n` and `suff[n]` remains 0.**
