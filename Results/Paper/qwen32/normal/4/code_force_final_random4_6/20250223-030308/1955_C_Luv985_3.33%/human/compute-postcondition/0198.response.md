Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `T` is non-zero and has been decreased by 1, `a` is the list of integers from the input, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `t` is `k % 2`. If `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0, `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
