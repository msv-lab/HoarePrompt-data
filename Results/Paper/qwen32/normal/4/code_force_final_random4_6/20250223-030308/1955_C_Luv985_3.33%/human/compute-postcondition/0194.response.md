Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0 minus `2 * mi`, `T` is non-zero and `T` is decreased by 1, `a` is the list of integers from the input with `a[0]` decremented by `mi` and `a[n-1]` decremented by `mi`, `mi` is the minimum of the original `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `ans` is incremented by 1, `l` is 1 if `a[l] == 0` otherwise `l` remains 0, `r` is `n - 2`.**

In natural language, the value of `r` has been decremented by 1, making it `n - 2`. All other variables retain their previously described states.
