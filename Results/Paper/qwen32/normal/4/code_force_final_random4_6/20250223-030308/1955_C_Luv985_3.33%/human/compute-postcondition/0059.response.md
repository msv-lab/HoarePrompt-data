Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `T` is 0; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is at least 1 - `mi * 2`; `a` is a list of integers where `a[l]` has been decreased by `mi` and `a[r]` has been decreased by `mi`; `l` is adjusted to be less than `r` + 1; `r` is adjusted to be greater than `l` + 1; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` before any potential decrease; If `a[l]` is 0, `ans` is increased by 1. If `a[r]` is 0, `ans` is increased by 1 and `r` is decreased by 1.**
