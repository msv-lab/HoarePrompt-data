The code snippet `ans = 0` changes the value of `ans` from 1 to 0. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is 5; `T` is non-zero and decreased by 1; `n` is the first part of the input as an integer; `k` is the second part of the input as an integer; `a` is the list of integers from the input; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `ans` is 0.**
