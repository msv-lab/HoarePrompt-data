The variable `k` is converted from a string to an integer. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `T` is 0; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer.
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `T` is 0; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer.**
