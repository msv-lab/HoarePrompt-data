Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0 (and is now decreased by `mi * 2`), `T` is non-zero and `T` is decreased by 1, `a` is the list of integers from the input with the first element decreased by `mi` and the last element decreased by `mi`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` (original) and `a[n-1]`, `ans` is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, all the initial conditions are maintained except for `l`, which has been incremented by 1.
