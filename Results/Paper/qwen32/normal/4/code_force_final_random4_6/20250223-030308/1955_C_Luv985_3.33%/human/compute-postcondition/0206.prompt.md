Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `T` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
while T:
    T -= 1
    n, k = input().split()
    n = int(n)
    k = int(k)
    a = input().split()
    a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    ans = 0
    while l < r and k > 0:
        mi = min(a[l], a[r])
        if mi * 2 <= k:
            a[l] -= mi
            a[r] -= mi
            k -= mi * 2
            if a[l] == 0:
                ans += 1
                l += 1
            if a[r] == 0:
                ans += 1
                r -= 1
        else:
            t = k % 2
            if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
                ans += 1
            break
    if l == r:
        ans += k >= a[l]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 5; `T` is 0; `n` is 5; `k` is 4; `a` is [0, 4, 5, 6, 4]; `l` is 1; `r` is 4; `ans` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `l` equals `r`. If `l` equals `r`, `ans` is updated to 2.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is 5 if the loop breaks due to `mi * 2 > k`, otherwise `t` is `k % 2` from the last iteration; `T` is non-zero and has been decreased by the number of iterations; `k` is the remaining value after all possible reductions; `a` is the list of integers with elements reduced as described; `l` is equal to `r`; `ans` is the count of elements that have been fully reduced to 0, incremented by 1 if `k >= a[l]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` remains the same, `k` is reduced to the remaining value, `T` is decreased by the number of iterations, `a` has elements reduced to 0 as much as possible, `l` and `r` are updated based on zeros in `a`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `k >= a[l]` and `l` equals `r`, `t` is `k % 2` if the loop breaks due to `mi * 2 > k`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
