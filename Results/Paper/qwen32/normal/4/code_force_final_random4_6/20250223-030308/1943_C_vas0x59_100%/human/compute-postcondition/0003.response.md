The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, converts them to integers, and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. The initial state of `u2vs` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists where `n` is at least 2; `u` is the first integer from the input; `v` is the second integer from the input.**
