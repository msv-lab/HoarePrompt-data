Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices that are directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree, and all vertices are indexed from 0 to `n-1`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `u2vs` will be an adjacency list representation of the tree. Each index `i` in `u2vs` will contain a list of all the vertices that are directly connected to vertex `i`. This means that if there is an edge between vertices `u` and `v`, both `u2vs[u]` and `u2vs[v]` will include each other in their respective lists. All vertices are 0-indexed.
