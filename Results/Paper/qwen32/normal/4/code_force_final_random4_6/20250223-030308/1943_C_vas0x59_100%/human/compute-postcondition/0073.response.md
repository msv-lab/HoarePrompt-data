Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `u2vs`, which is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers representing the neighbors of a vertex in a tree, and a parameter `n`, which is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^3. The function returns `None`.**
