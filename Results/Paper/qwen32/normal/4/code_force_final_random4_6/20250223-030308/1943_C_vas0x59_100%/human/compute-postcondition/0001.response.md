The code snippet `u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]` initializes `u2vs` as a list of `n` empty lists. This means that `u2vs` will have `n` sublists, each of which is initially empty.

Given the initial state that `u2vs` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers representing the neighbors of a vertex in a tree, and `n` is an input integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, the code changes `u2vs` to be a list of `n` empty sublists.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists; `n` is an input integer representing the number of vertices in the tree.**
