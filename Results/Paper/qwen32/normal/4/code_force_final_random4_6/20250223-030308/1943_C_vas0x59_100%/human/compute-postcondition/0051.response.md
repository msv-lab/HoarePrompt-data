The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `ci + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`u2vs` remains unchanged as it is a list of adjacency lists representing the tree; `d` remains unchanged as it is the list of distances from vertex `a` to all other vertices; `a` remains unchanged as it is the return value of `func_1(d)`; `previous` remains unchanged as it is the list of previous vertices for the shortest path tree; `b` remains unchanged as it is also the return value of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` remains unchanged as a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in reverse order with an odd length; `ops` is now `[(c, 0), (c, 1)]`; `ci` remains unchanged as the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2; `c` remains unchanged as the middle element of `path_ba`; `i` is 2**
