The code snippet assigns the value of `path_ba[ci1]` to the variable `c1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `ci1` is `ci2 - 1` and `ci2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`, `c1` will be the element at the index `ci1` in the list `path_ba`.

Output State: **`u2vs` remains unchanged as it is a list of adjacency lists representing the tree; `d` remains unchanged as it is the list of distances from vertex `a` to all other vertices; `a` remains unchanged as it is the return value of `func_1(d)`; `previous` remains unchanged as it is the list of previous vertices for the shortest path tree; `b` remains unchanged as it is also the return value of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` will be a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in reverse order; `ops` is an empty list; the length of `path_ba` is even; `ci2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`; `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`; `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`.**
