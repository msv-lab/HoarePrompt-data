The code snippet `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` modifies the value of `ans1` by subtracting twice the value of `a[i]` from it. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is not modified by this code snippet, but it is mentioned that `i` is `i + 1` in the initial state, which is an external condition and not affected by the current line of code.

Given the initial state, `ans1` is initially the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus `4 * a[i]`. After executing the code snippet, `ans1` is further reduced by `2 * a[i]`.

Therefore, the new value of `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus `4 * a[i]` minus `2 * a[i]`, which simplifies to the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus `6 * a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k` are integers obtained from the input, `x` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order obtained from the input, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus 6 * a[i], `i` is `i + 1`**.
