Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n`, `k` are integers where `k` is greater than 0 and `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is updated to `ans1 + a[i]`, `ans2` retains its initial value, `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simple terms, `ans1` has been increased by the value of `a[i]`, and `i` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
