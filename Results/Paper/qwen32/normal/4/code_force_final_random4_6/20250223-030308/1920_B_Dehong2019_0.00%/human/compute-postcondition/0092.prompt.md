Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; For each test case, n, k, and x are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n. The array a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
    a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())), reverse=True)
    ans1 = sum(a)
    for i in range(x):
        ans1 -= a[i] * 2
    ans2 = ans1
    for i in range(k):
        ans1 += a[i]
        if i + x < n:
            ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
        ans = max(ans1, ans2)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` minus twice the sum of the elements from position `x` to `k+x-1` (if within bounds); `ans2` retains its initial value; `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: ans1 is the sum of all elements in a minus twice the sum of the first x elements of a plus the sum of the first k elements of a minus twice the sum of elements from index x to x + k - 1 if they exist; ans2 is the sum of all elements in a minus twice the sum of the first x elements of a; ans is the maximum value between the updated ans1 and ans2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus the sum of the first `k` elements of `a`, minus `2 * a[i + x]` for each `i` where `i + x < n`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1`, `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2` (which is `ans1` itself), `t` is `t - 1`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
