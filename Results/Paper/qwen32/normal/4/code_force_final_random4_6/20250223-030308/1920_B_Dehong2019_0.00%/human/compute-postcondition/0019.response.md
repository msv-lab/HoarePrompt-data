Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k` are integers where `k` is greater than 0 and `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order. If `i + x` is less than `n`, then `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[i]` minus `a[i + x] * 2`. Otherwise, `ans1` remains unchanged. `ans2` retains its initial value throughout. `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans` is now the greater of `ans1` and `ans2`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `ans1`, and `ans2`) retain their initial values or states as described.
