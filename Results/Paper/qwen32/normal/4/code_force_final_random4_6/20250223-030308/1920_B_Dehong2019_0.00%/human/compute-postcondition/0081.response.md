The code snippet `ans1 += a[i]` increments `ans1` by the value of `a[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `ans1` will be updated by adding `a[1]` to its current value.

Let's break down the changes:
- `ans1` will be updated to its previous value plus `a[1]`.
- `ans2` and `ans` will remain unchanged until further operations are performed on them.
- `t` will remain `t - 1` as it was not affected by this code snippet.
- `n`, `k`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged in value as they are not modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`a` is sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0]` if `i + x < n`, otherwise it remains unchanged, plus `a[1]`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1` minus `a[0]` if `i + x < n`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `ans` is the maximum value between the updated `ans1` and `ans2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` must be greater than 0, and `i` is 1.**
