To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the expression for `ans1` and understand the relationship between `ans1` and `ans2` to find the maximum value that `ans` will hold.

### Analysis of `ans1`:
The expression for `ans1` is given as:
\[ \text{ans1} = \left( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a[i] \right) - 2 \times \left( \sum_{i=0}^{x-1} a[i] \right) + \left( \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} a[i] \right) - 2 \times \left( \sum_{i=x}^{k+x-1} a[i] \right) \]

Where:
- \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a[i]\) is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
- \(\sum_{i=0}^{x-1} a[i]\) is the sum of the first `x` elements of the list `a`.
- \(\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} a[i]\) is the sum of the first `k` elements of the list `a`.
- \(\sum_{i=x}^{k+x-1} a[i]\) is the sum of the elements from position `x` to `k+x-1` (if within bounds).

### Analysis of `ans2`:
The problem states that `ans2` retains its initial value. Since no initial value is specified for `ans2`, we will assume it is some constant value, say `C`.

### Calculation of `ans`:
The variable `ans` is defined as the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`:
\[ \text{ans} = \max(\text{ans1}, \text{ans2}) \]

### Output:
Since we do not have the specific values of the list `a`, `x`, and `k`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans1`. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum value between ans1 and ans2, and ans1 is calculated based on the sums of elements in the list a as described)**
