Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`; `ans2` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`; `ans` is the maximum value between the updated `ans1` and `ans2`; `n`, `k`, and `a` are the integers read from the input with `a` sorted in descending order.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    ans1 += a[i]
    if i + x < n:
        ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
    ans = max(ans1, ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[i]` minus twice `a[i + x]` if `i + x < n`. Otherwise, `ans1` remains as the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[i]`. `ans2` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`. `ans` is the maximum value between the updated `ans1` and `ans2`. `n` and `a` are integers read from the input with `a` sorted in descending order; `k` must be greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus the sum of `a[i]` and `a[i + x]` if `i + x < n` minus `2 * a[i + x]`. Otherwise, `ans1` remains as the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `2 * a[i]` minus `2 * a[i + x]`. `ans2` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`. `ans` is the maximum value between the updated `ans1` and `ans2`. `n` and `a` are integers read from the input with `a` sorted in descending order; `k` must be greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`. If `i + x < n`, `ans1` is further adjusted by adding `a[i]` and `a[i + x]` and subtracting `4 * a[i + x]`. Otherwise, `ans1` is adjusted by adding `2 * a[i]` and subtracting `4 * a[i + x]`. `ans2` remains as the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`. `ans` is the maximum value between the updated `ans1` and `ans2`. `n` and `a` are integers read from the input with `a` sorted in descending order; `k` must be greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
