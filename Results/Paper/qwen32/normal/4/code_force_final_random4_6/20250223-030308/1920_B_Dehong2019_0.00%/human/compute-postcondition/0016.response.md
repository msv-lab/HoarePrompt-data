Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k` are integers where `k` is greater than 0 and `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[i]`, `ans2` is equal to the initial value of `ans1`, and `i + x` is less than `n`.**
