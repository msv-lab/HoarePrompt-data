Postcondition: **`a` is sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0]`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1` minus `a[0]`, `ans` is the maximum value between the updated `ans1` and `ans2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n`, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `i + x` is less than `n`**
