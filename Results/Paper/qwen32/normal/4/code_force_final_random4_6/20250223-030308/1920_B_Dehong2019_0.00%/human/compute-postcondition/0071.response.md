The code snippet `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` modifies the value of `ans1` by subtracting twice the value of `a[i]` from it. Given that `i` is 1, this means `a[i]` refers to the second element of the sorted list `a` (since list indices start at 0).

The output state will be:
- `a` remains sorted in descending order.
- `ans1` is updated to its previous value minus twice the value of `a[1]`.
- `ans2` remains unchanged.
- `ans` remains the maximum value between the updated `ans1` and `ans2`.
- `t` remains `t - 1`.
- `n`, `k`, and `x` remain the integers read from the input.
- `x` must still be greater than 0.
- `i` remains 1.

Output State: **`a` is sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `a[i] * 4` minus `a[1] * 2`, `ans2` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`, `ans` is the maximum value between the updated `ans1` and `ans2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n`, `k`, and `x` are the integers read from the input, `x` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1.**
