Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `numbers` is a list containing one element `[num1, num2]`; `nums` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `num1` is the integer value of `nums[0]`; `num2` is the integer value of `nums[1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `n`, `t`, the edges of the tree, `u_1`, `numbers`, `nums`, `num1`, and `num2` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
