The code snippet provided is `num2 = int(nums[1])`. This line of code converts the second element of the list `nums` to an integer and assigns it to the variable `num2`. 

Given the initial state, `nums` is a list of strings, and `num2` is the integer value of `nums[1]`. After executing the code, `num2` will hold the integer value of the second element of `nums`.

The other variables (`n`, `t`, the tree edges, `u_1`, `numbers`, `num1`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `numbers` is a list containing one element `[num1, num2]`; `nums` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `num1` is the integer value of `nums[0]`; `num2` is the integer value of `nums[1]`.**
