The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `s1`, `s2`, `counter`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, `i` is either 2 or 3 with specific conditions on the characters around `i` if `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`. Otherwise, `i` is 2 with `s1[i]` equal to `s2[i]`, `counter` is either 1 or 2 based on the conditions mentioned.
