To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop condition: `i` and `n`.

The `while` loop condition is `i < n`. Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5.
- `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's.
- `counter` is 0.
- `i` is 0.

Since `i` is initialized to 0 and `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), the condition `i < n` will always be true for the first iteration because 0 is less than any positive integer `n`.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute the first time. The initial state already satisfies the condition for the loop to run.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, `counter` is 0, `i` is 0**
