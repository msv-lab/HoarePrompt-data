Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s1` into the desired state `s2`. Let's analyze the logic of the function `func_1` and find a counterexample where it fails.

The function `func_1` attempts to count the number of moves by comparing each pair of corresponding characters in `s1` and `s2`. If the characters differ, it increments the counter and moves to the next pair or skips an additional pair if consecutive characters also differ. However, this approach does not accurately account for the minimum number of operations needed, especially in cases where swapping or moving cats can be optimized.

Consider the following test case:
```
3
010
101
```
The initial state is `010` and the desired state is `101`. The function `func_1` would count the number of differences and attempt to resolve them, but it does not correctly handle the optimal way to move the cats.

Let's break down the correct operations:
1. Move the cat from box 2 to box 1 (state becomes `110`).
2. Move the cat from box 2 to box 3 (state becomes `101`).

This requires 2 operations. However, the function `func_1` would likely count more operations because it does not consider the optimal sequence of moves.

Another example:
```
4
0101
1010
```
The function `func_1` might incorrectly count the operations as 4, but the correct minimal operations are:
1. Swap cats in boxes 2 and 3 (state becomes `0110`).
2. Swap cats in boxes 1 and 2 (state becomes `1010`).

This requires only 2 operations.

Thus, the function `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations for all possible cases, and therefore, the program is incorrect.
