Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `i` is less than `n`, and `i` has been incremented by 1. If `s1[i]` was not equal to `s2[i]`, `counter` is increased by 1. If `i` was less than `n - 1` and `s1[i + 1]` is not equal to `s2[i + 1]` and `s1[i]` is not equal to `s1[i + 1]`, then `i` is increased by an additional 1.**
