Output State: **`ver` is the vertex that was at the front of the deque `q`, `q` has had its first element removed, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, and `vis[node]` is 1 for each `node` in `q`.**

Natural language explanation: The variable `ver` now holds the value of the vertex that was at the front of the deque `q`. The deque `q` has been modified to remove this front element. The list `vis` remains unchanged, indicating which vertices have been visited.
