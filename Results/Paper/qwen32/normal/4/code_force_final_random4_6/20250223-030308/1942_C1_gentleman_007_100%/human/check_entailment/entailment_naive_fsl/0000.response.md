Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not contain any function or logic that solves the problem described. The code consists of a series of unrelated utility functions, none of which address the task of finding the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed from a regular polygon with given vertices.

To solve the problem, we need an algorithm that takes the number of sides of the polygon, the number of vertices already chosen, and the vertices themselves, and then calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed. The provided code does not implement any such algorithm, so it cannot be considered correct for the given problem description.

Here is an outline of what a correct solution might look like:

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases, and for each test case, read the number of sides of the polygon, the number of vertices already chosen, and the list of chosen vertices.

2. **Sorting**: Sort the list of chosen vertices to facilitate the counting of triangles.

3. **Counting Triangles**: Use a greedy approach or dynamic programming to count the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed from the chosen vertices. This involves ensuring that the vertices form valid triangles and that no diagonals intersect.

4. **Output**: For each test case, output the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles.

Since the provided code does not implement any of these steps, it is incorrect for the problem at hand.
