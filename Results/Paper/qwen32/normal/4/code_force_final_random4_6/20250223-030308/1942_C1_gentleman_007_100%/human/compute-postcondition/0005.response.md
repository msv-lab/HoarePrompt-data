Given the initial state, we know the following:
- `ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph.
- `graph` is a dictionary (or list of lists) where each key (or index) is a vertex and its value is a list of adjacent vertices.
- `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise.
- `q` is an empty deque.
- `vis[ver]` is 1, indicating that the vertex `ver` has been visited.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(ver, end=' ')
```

This statement will print the value of `ver` followed by a space, without a newline at the end.

Since the exact value of `ver` is not provided in the initial state, we can only describe it as an integer representing a vertex in the graph.

Output: **ver (where ver is an integer representing a vertex in the graph)**
