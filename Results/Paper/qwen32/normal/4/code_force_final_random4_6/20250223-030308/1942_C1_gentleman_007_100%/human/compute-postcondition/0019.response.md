Output State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary (or list of lists) where each key (or index) is a vertex and its value is a list of adjacent vertices, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, `q` is a deque containing all unvisited adjacent vertices of `ver` that have been visited during the loop, and `vis[node]` is 1 for each `node` in `q`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing, all the adjacent vertices of `ver` that were not previously visited are now marked as visited (`vis[node]` is 1 for each of these nodes), and these nodes have been added to the deque `q`. The state of `ver`, `graph`, and any other vertices not adjacent to `ver` remains unchanged.
