Based on the provided initial state, we can break down the components involved in the `print` statement:

1. **`ver`**: This variable represents the vertex that was at the front of the queue `q`. Since the queue `q` has one less element after this operation, it implies that `ver` was the first element in `q` before it was removed.

2. **`end=' '`**: This argument in the `print` function specifies that a space should be used as the separator (and end character) instead of the default newline character. This means that whatever is printed will be followed by a space, and the next print statement (if any) will continue on the same line.

Given this information, the `print` statement will output the value of `ver` followed by a space. Since the exact value of `ver` is not specified in the initial state, we can only describe it as the vertex that was at the front of the queue `q`.

Output: **ver (where ver is the vertex that was at the front of the queue `q`) **
