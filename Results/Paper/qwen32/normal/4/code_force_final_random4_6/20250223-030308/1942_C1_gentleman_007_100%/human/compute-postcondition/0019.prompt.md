Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary (or list of lists) where each key (or index) is a vertex and its value is a list of adjacent vertices, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, `q` is an empty deque, `vis[ver]` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for node in graph[ver]:
    if not vis[node]:
        q.append(node)
        vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary (or list of lists) where `graph[ver]` must contain at least one adjacent vertex, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, `q` is a deque, and `vis[ver]` is 1. If `vis[node]` was originally 0, then `q` contains `node` and `vis[node]` is updated to 1. Otherwise, `q` remains empty and `vis[node]` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary (or list of lists) where `graph[ver]` must contain at least one more adjacent vertex, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, `q` is a deque. If `vis[node]` was 0, then `node` is appended to `q` and `vis[node]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `q` remains unchanged and `vis[node]` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary (or list of lists) where `graph[ver]` must contain at least one more adjacent vertex, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, `node` is the next adjacent vertex in `graph[ver]` that has not yet been processed. If `vis[node]` was originally 0, then `vis[node]` is now 1 and `node` is appended to the deque `q`. Otherwise, `vis[node]` remains unchanged and `q` is not modified.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
