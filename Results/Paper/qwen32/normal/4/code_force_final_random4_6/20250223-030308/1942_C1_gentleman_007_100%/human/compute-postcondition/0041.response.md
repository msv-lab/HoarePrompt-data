The only object in the loop head is the variable `node`, and it is being iterated over `graph[ver]`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one element. The states of `ver`, `q`, and `vis` do not directly affect whether the loop can execute, so we only need to adjust `graph[ver]`.

State: **`ver` is the vertex that was at the front of `q`, `q` has one less element, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 for all vertices that are reachable from the initial `ver` and 0 for all other vertices, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one element**
