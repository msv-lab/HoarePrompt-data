Postcondition: **The `dp` matrix is fully populated with the lengths of the longest common subsequence (LCS) between all prefixes of `a` and `b`. The value at `dp[len(a)][len(b)]` contains the length of the LCS between the entire lists `a` and `b`. `i` is 0. `j` is 1 if `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`, otherwise `j` is 0. The list `l` contains the element `a[0]` if `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i - 1][j]` and not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block, considering both possible outcomes of the condition.
