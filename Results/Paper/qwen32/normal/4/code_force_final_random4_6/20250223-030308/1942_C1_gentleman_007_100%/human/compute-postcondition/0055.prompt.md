Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary (or list of lists) where each key (or index) is a vertex and its value is a list of adjacent vertices, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, `q` is a deque containing the single element `ver`, `vis[ver]` is 1.
Code of the loop:
while len(q):
    ver = q.popleft()
    print(ver, end=' ')
    for node in graph[ver]:
        if not vis[node]:
            q.append(node)
            vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary (or list of lists) where each key (or index) is a vertex and its value is a list of adjacent vertices, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, `q` is a deque containing all unvisited adjacent vertices of `ver` that have been visited during the loop, and `vis[node]` is 1 for each `node` in `q`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: - `ver` will be the last vertex that was processed. However, `ver` is not directly part of the final output state since it changes with each iteration and is not retained after the loop.
- `q` will contain all vertices that are reachable from the initial `ver` in the order they were discovered (BFS order), starting from the initial `ver` and including all its neighbors, their neighbors, and so on, but with the initial `ver` removed from the front.
- `vis` will be a list where `vis[i]` is 1 for all vertices that are reachable from the initial `ver` and 0 for all other vertices.

Given the above, the final output state can be described as:

Output State:
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `ver` is the vertex that was at the front of `q`, `q` is empty, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 for all vertices that are reachable from the initial `ver` and 0 for all other vertices.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
