Output State: **The `dp` matrix is fully populated with the lengths of the longest common subsequence (LCS) between all prefixes of `a` and `b`. The value at `dp[len(a)][len(b)]` contains the length of the LCS between the entire lists `a` and `b`. `i` is 0, and `j` is 1. `l` is an empty list. The value at `dp[i][j]` is not equal to the value at `dp[i][j - 1]`, and the value at `dp[i][j]` is not equal to the value at `dp[i - 1][j]`.**

In natural language: The `dp` matrix remains fully populated with the LCS lengths as before. The value of `i` is now 0, while `j` remains 1. The list `l` is still empty. The conditions regarding the values at `dp[i][j]`, `dp[i][j - 1]`, and `dp[i - 1][j]` are unchanged.
