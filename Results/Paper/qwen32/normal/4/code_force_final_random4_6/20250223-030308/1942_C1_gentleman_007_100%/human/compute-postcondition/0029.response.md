Output State: **`ver` is the vertex that was at the front of the deque `q`, `q` has the first element `ver` followed by the previous elements of `q` and now includes `node` at the end, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, and `vis[node]` is 1, `graph[ver]` must have at least one unprocessed node, `node` is the next unprocessed node in `graph[ver]`.**

In natural language: The deque `q` now includes `node` at the end. The `vis` list has `vis[node]` set to 1, indicating that `node` has been visited. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
