The function accepts two parameters, `n` (an integer representing the number of sides of a polygon) and `m` (an integer representing the number of edges or connections to be processed). It returns a list `l` containing `n + 1` lists, where each list at index `x` contains all the indices `y` that are connected to `x`.
