The code `q.append(node)` adds the `node` to the end of the deque `q`. The other variables remain unchanged except for `q`, which now includes `node` at the end.

Output State: **`ver` is the vertex that was at the front of the deque `q`, `q` has the first element `ver` followed by the previous elements of `q` and now includes `node` at the end, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, `vis[node]` is 1, `graph[ver]` must have at least one unprocessed node, and `node` is the next unprocessed node in `graph[ver]`.**
