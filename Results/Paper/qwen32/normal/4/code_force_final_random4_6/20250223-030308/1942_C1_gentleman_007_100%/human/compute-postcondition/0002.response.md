The code sets the value of `vis[ver]` to 1, indicating that the vertex `ver` has been visited. The other variables (`graph`, `q`, and `ver`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary (or list of lists) where each key (or index) is a vertex and its value is a list of adjacent vertices, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, `q` is a deque containing the single element `ver`, `vis[ver]` is 1.**
