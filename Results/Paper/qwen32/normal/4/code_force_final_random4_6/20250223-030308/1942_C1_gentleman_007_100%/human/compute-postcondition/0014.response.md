Postcondition: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary (or list of lists) where `graph[ver]` must contain at least one more adjacent vertex, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, `q` is a deque. If `vis[node]` was 0, then `node` is appended to `q` and `vis[node]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `q` remains unchanged and `vis[node]` remains 0.**
