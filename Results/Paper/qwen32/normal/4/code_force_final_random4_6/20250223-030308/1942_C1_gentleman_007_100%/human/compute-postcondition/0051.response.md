Output State: **`ver` is the vertex that was at the front of `q`, `node` is the next element in `graph[ver]`, `q` now includes `node` if `not vis[node]`, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 for all vertices that are reachable from the initial `ver` including `node`**

Explanation: The variable `q` has been updated to include `node` at the end of the queue if `node` was not previously visited (`not vis[node]`). The other variables (`ver`, `node`, `vis`) remain unchanged in terms of their descriptions.
