The code provided only takes an input integer and assigns it to `n`. This does not affect the variable `t` or the `pattern` list (if it exists). Therefore, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and `n` is updated to the new input value. The condition regarding whether `n` is odd or even and the creation of the `pattern` list are not executed in this snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 49; `n` is the new input integer.**
