The code appends the character at the index `i % 2 ^ 1` of the string 'AB' to the `pattern` list. Given that `i` is 2, we calculate the index as `2 % 2 ^ 1`, which simplifies to `2 % 2`, resulting in 0. Therefore, the character at index 0 of 'AB' is 'A'. This 'A' is appended to the `pattern` list, which originally had five elements ending in 'A'. After the operation, `pattern` will have six elements, with the last two being 'A's. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` is an even integer and `n` is greater than 2, `pattern` is a list with six elements ending in 'A', `i` is 2**.
