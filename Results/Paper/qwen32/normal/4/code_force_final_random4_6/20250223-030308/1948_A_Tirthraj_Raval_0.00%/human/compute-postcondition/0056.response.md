Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is even, it prints 'YES' followed by a string of length `n` consisting of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters, starting with 'A'.**
