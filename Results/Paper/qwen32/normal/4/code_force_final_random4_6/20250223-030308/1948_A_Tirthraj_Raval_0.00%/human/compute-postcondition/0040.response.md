The initial state provides information about the variables `t` and `n`, but these variables are not used in the given print statement. The print statement only contains the string `'YES'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The variable `t` is described as an input integer such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 49\). This implies that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
2. The variable `n` is described as a new input integer. However, the value of `n` is not relevant to the print statement.
3. The print statement is `print('YES')`, which directly prints the string `'YES'`.

Since the print statement does not depend on the values of `t` or `n`, the output will simply be `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
