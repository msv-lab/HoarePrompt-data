The code snippet appends either 'A' or 'B' to the `pattern` list based on the value of `i % 2`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the given initial state, so we can't determine the exact character ('A' or 'B') that gets appended. Assuming `i` is defined elsewhere in the code and is used in this context, the `pattern` list will have one additional element after the execution of this line.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` is an even integer and `n` is at least 2, `pattern` is a list with one additional element, which is either 'A' or 'B'**.
