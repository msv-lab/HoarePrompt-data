You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer such that `t` is 0; `n` is the last input integer. If `n` is odd, then no additional changes are made to the variables. If `n` is even, then `pattern` is a list with `n` elements alternating between 'A' and 'B', starting with 'A'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program has a logical flaw in the way it constructs the string for even values of `n`. The code attempts to create a pattern where each pair of characters alternates between 'A' and 'B', but the logic for generating the pattern is incorrect.

Here's an example of where the program does not work as expected:

**Input:**
```
2
2
4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
AB
YES
ABAB
```

**Actual Output:**
```
YES
AB
YES
ABBA
```

In the actual output for `n=4`, the string "ABBA" is generated. However, this string does not meet the criteria of having exactly 4 special characters. The special characters in "ABBA" are at positions 1 and 4, so there are only 2 special characters, not 4.

The correct pattern for `n=4` should be "ABAB" or any other string that has exactly 4 special characters.

The problem lies in the line:
```python
pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
```
This line does not correctly alternate the characters. Instead, it uses bitwise XOR (`^`), which is not the correct approach for alternating characters.

A correct approach to generate the pattern would be:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('A')
                pattern.append('B')
            print(''.join(pattern))
```

This corrected version ensures that the pattern alternates correctly between 'A' and 'B', resulting in a string with the correct number of special characters.
