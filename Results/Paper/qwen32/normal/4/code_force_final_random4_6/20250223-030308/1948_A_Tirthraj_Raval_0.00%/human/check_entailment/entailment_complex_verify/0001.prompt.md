You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer such that `t` is 0; `n` is the last input integer. If `n` is odd, then no additional changes are made to the variables. If `n` is even, then `pattern` is a list with `n` elements alternating between 'A' and 'B', starting with 'A'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is even, it prints 'YES' followed by a string of length `n` consisting of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters, starting with 'A'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to generate a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly `n` special characters. A special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

### Key Observations

1. **Special Characters**: A character is special if it is different from one neighbor and the same as the other neighbor. For example, in the string "AAABAACC":
   - Position 1 ('A'): Special (equal to the next 'A')
   - Position 3 ('A'): Special (equal to the previous 'A' and different from the next 'B')
   - Position 5 ('A'): Special (equal to the previous 'B' and different from the next 'A')
   - Position 6 ('A'): Special (equal to the previous 'A' and different from the next 'C')
   - Position 7 ('C'): Special (equal to the previous 'A' and different from the next 'C')
   - Position 8 ('C'): Special (equal to the previous 'C')

2. **Pattern Identification**:
   - If we look at the given example "AAABAACC", we see that the pattern "ABA" creates special characters at positions 3, 5, and 6.
   - Extending this, "ABABAB..." will create special characters at every second position after the first pair.

3. **Number of Special Characters**:
   - For every two characters in the pattern "AB", there is exactly one special character.
   - Therefore, to have `n` special characters, we need `2 * n` characters in the string.

### Program Analysis

Let's analyze the provided program to see if it correctly implements the above logic.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because an odd number of special characters cannot be formed using the pattern "AB" (which creates special characters in pairs).

3. **Pattern Generation**:
   - If `n` is even, the program generates a pattern using the string "AB".
   - It appends 'A' and 'B' alternately to form the pattern.
   - The pattern is constructed by repeating the sequence "AB" `n // 2` times.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'YES' followed by the generated pattern.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles the case where `n` is odd by printing 'NO'. For even `n`, it generates a pattern that ensures exactly `n` special characters by using the "AB" sequence.

### Correctness

Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a string with exactly `n` special characters can be formed and generates such a string when possible.
