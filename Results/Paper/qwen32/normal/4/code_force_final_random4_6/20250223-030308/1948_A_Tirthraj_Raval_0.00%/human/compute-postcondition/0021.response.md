The code snippet provided only takes an input for `n` and does not affect the variable `t` or the `pattern` list (if it exists). Since the input for `n` is taken, `n` will now hold the value of the input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 49; `n` is the input integer. If `n` is odd, then no additional changes are made to the variables. If `n` is even, then `pattern` is a list with `n` elements alternating between 'A' and 'B', starting with 'A'.**
