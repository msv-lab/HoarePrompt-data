The code appends an element to the `pattern` list based on the value of `i % 2`. Given that `i` is 1, `i % 2` equals 1. Therefore, the element at index 1 of the string 'AB' is appended to `pattern`, which is 'B'. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 49, `n` must be at least 4, `i` is 1, `pattern` is ['A', 'B', 'B']**.
