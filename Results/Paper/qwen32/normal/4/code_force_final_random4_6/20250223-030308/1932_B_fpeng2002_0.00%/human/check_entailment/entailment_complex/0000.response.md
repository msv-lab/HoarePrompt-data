### Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the logic of the provided function and compare it with the problem requirements.

The function `func()` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The function then calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs and prints this year for each test case.

The calculation of the year in which the n-th sign occurs is done in a loop that iterates through each sign's periodicity. For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year by:
1. Adding 1 to the current `start_year` to account for the fact that the next sign must occur strictly after the previous one.
2. Dividing the incremented `start_year` by the current sign's periodicity `nums[x]` and adding 1 to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`.
3. Multiplying the result by `nums[x]` to get the actual year of the next sign's occurrence.

This logic correctly implements the requirement that each subsequent sign must occur strictly after the previous one. The calculation ensures that the next sign's occurrence is the smallest multiple of its periodicity that is greater than the year of the previous sign's occurrence.

Let's verify the function with the provided example:

1. **First test case:**
   - Signs: [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]
   - Year 1: First sign occurs at year 3.
   - Year 2: Second sign occurs at year 4 (first multiple of 2 after 3).
   - Year 3: Third sign occurs at year 8 (first multiple of 4 after 4).
   - Year 4: Fourth sign occurs at year 10 (first multiple of 5 after 8).
   - Year 5: Fifth sign occurs at year 18 (first multiple of 9 after 10).
   - Year 6: Sixth sign occurs at year 36 (first multiple of 18 after 18).
   - Output: 36.

2. **Second test case:**
   - Signs: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   - Year 1: First sign occurs at year 1.
   - Year 2: Second sign occurs at year 2 (first multiple of 2 after 1).
   - Year 3: Third sign occurs at year 3 (first multiple of 3 after 2).
   - Year 4: Fourth sign occurs at year 4 (first multiple of 4 after 3).
   - Year 5: Fifth sign occurs at year 5 (first multiple of 5 after 4).
   - Output: 5.

3. **Third test case:**
   - Signs: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
   - All signs occur every year, so each subsequent sign occurs in the next year.
   - Output: 5.

4. **Fourth test case:**
   - Signs: [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]
   - Year 1: First sign occurs at year 50.
   - Year 2: Second sign occurs at year 60 (first multiple of 30 after 50).
   - Year 3: Third sign occurs at year 761 (first multiple of 711 after 60).
   - Year 4: Fourth sign occurs at year 961 (first multiple of 200 after 761).
   - Year 5: Fifth sign occurs at year 1506 (first multiple of 503 after 961).
   - Year 6: Sixth sign occurs at year 2012 (first multiple of 1006 after 1506).
   - Output: 2012.

The function correctly calculates the year for each test case based on the problem description.
