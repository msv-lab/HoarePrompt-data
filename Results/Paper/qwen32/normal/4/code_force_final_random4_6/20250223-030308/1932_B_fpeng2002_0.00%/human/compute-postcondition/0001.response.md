To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `num_tests > 0` is satisfied. Given that `num_tests` is the input integer representing the number of test cases, we need to adjust its value to be greater than 0.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`.
2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `num_tests` is greater than 0.
3. **Adjust the State**: Since `num_tests` is an input integer, we need to ensure that it is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The current state indicates that `num_tests` is an input integer, but it does not specify its value. To guarantee that the loop executes, we need to adjust the state such that `num_tests` is explicitly greater than 0.

Given that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, it doesn't affect the condition for the `while` loop directly, but it might be related to the context of the program. For the purpose of this task, we only need to focus on `num_tests`.

**Adjusted State**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` must be greater than 0**
