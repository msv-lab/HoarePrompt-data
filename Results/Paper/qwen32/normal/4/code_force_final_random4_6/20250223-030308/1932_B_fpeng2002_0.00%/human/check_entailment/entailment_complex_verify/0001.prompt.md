You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program: 
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        
        start_year = 0
        
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        
        print(start_year)
        
    #State: `num_tests` is 0, `n` and `nums` are the values from the last test case, `start_year` is the final value calculated for the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific year based on the input integers.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs, given the periodicity of each sign and the condition that signs must occur sequentially.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and their periodicities (`nums`).

2. **Logic to Determine the Year of the n-th Sign:**
   - The program initializes `start_year` to 0.
   - For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year considering the previous sign's occurrence year (`start_year`).
   - The formula used to calculate the next occurrence year is:
     ```python
     start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
     ```
   - Let's break this down:
     - `(start_year + 1) // nums[x]` computes the number of complete cycles that have passed or are starting from `start_year + 1` to the next multiple of `nums[x]`.
     - Adding 1 to this result ensures we are considering the next occurrence strictly after `start_year`.
     - Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the exact year of the next occurrence.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the final `start_year`, which is the year when the n-th sign occurs.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - `n = 6`, `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
   - Initial `start_year = 0`
   - Iteration 1: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
   - Iteration 2: `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
   - Iteration 3: `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
   - Iteration 4: `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
   - Iteration 5: `start_year = ((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
   - Iteration 6: `start_year = ((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
   - Output: `36` (matches the expected result)

2. **Other Test Cases:**
   - Similarly, the program correctly calculates the year for other test cases as well.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year of the n-th sign's occurrence, adhering to the sequential occurrence condition. Therefore, the program is correct.
