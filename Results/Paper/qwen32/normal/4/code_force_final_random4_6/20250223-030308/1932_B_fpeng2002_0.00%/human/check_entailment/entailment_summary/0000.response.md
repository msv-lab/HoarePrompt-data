Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided program and compare it against the problem requirements.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then iterates `t` times to handle each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and then reads `n` integers representing the periodicity of each sign.

2. **Logic for Determining the Year of the Apocalypse**:
   - The program initializes `start_year` to 0, which implies the start of waiting is from year 0.
   - For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year as follows:
     - `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`
   - This formula ensures that the program finds the next year that is a multiple of `nums[x]` and is strictly after `start_year`.

3. **Output**: After processing all signs in a test case, the program prints the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs, which is the year the apocalypse happens.

Let's verify the formula used for finding the next sign occurrence year:
- `start_year + 1` ensures that we are looking for the next occurrence strictly after the current `start_year`.
- `(start_year + 1) // nums[x]` gives the integer division of `start_year + 1` by `nums[x]`, which is the count of complete cycles of `nums[x]` years up to `start_year`.
- Adding 1 to this count and then multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the next occurrence year that is a multiple of `nums[x]`.

The program correctly implements the logic for determining the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs and the apocalypse happens for each test case.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
