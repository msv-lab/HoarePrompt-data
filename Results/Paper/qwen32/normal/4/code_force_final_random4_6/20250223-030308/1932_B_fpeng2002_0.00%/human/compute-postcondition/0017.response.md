The provided Python code snippet updates the `nums` list by reading a line of input, splitting it by spaces, and converting each split string into an integer. This operation overwrites the previous value of `nums`.

Given the initial state, `nums` was a list of integers, and `n` was an input integer. The value of `t`, `num_tests`, and `start_year` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `num_tests` is greater than 0 minus 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `start_year` is the result of the loop's final calculation.**

In simpler terms: The variable `nums` is now a new list of integers derived from the input. All other variables retain their previous values.
