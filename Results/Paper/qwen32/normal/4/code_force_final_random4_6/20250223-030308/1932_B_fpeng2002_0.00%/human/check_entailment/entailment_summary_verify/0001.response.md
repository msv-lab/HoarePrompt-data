Let's carefully analyze the provided program and verify its correctness using the problem description and the function summary.

### Problem Reiteration:
The task is to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs, given the periodicity of each sign and the condition that signs must occur sequentially. Specifically, if the i-th sign occurs in year `x`, the (i+1)-th sign must occur in a year `y > x` that is a multiple of `a_{i+1}`.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their periodicities `nums`. The logic to determine the year of the n-th sign is as follows:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `start_year` is initialized to 0.

2. **Iterative Calculation:**
   - For each sign `i` (from 0 to `n-1`), the program updates `start_year` using the formula:
     ```python
     start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
     ```
   - This formula calculates the next occurrence of the sign strictly after `start_year`.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - `n = 6`, `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
   - Initial `start_year = 0`
   - Iteration 1: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
   - Iteration 2: `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
   - Iteration 3: `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
   - Iteration 4: `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
   - Iteration 5: `start_year = ((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
   - Iteration 6: `start_year = ((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
   - Output: `36` (matches the expected result)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - `n = 5`, `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - Initial `start_year = 0`
   - Iteration 1: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2`
   - Iteration 2: `start_year = ((2 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
   - Iteration 3: `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 6`
   - Iteration 4: `start_year = ((6 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
   - Iteration 5: `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
   - Output: `10` (does not match the expected result of `5`)

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - `n = 5`, `nums = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - Initial `start_year = 0`
   - Iteration 1: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2`
   - Iteration 2: `start_year = ((2 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 4`
   - Iteration 3: `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 6`
   - Iteration 4: `start_year = ((6 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 8`
   - Iteration 5: `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 10`
   - Output: `10` (does not match the expected result of `5`)

### Analysis of the Formula:
The formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is incorrect for the problem's requirements. It ensures that the next occurrence is strictly after `start_year` but does not correctly account for the sequence of events.

### Correct Formula:
The correct way to calculate the next occurrence year is to find the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`. This can be done using:
```python
start_year = ((start_year // nums[x]) + 1) * nums[x]
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the incorrect formula used to calculate the next occurrence year. The correct formula should be `start_year = ((start_year // nums[x]) + 1) * nums[x]`.

Final: **False**
