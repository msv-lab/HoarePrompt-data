Reasoning:
The task is to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given that each sign occurs periodically and must occur sequentially. The provided program reads the number of test cases, the number of signs for each test case, and the periodicity of each sign. It then calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs for each test case.

The logic of the program is as follows:
1. It initializes `start_year` to 0, indicating the start of the time period.
2. For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year by:
   - Adding 1 to `start_year` to ensure that the next sign starts occurring strictly after the previous one.
   - Dividing this value by the periodicity of the current sign and rounding up to find the next multiple of the periodicity.
   - Multiplying this value by the periodicity to get the exact year of the next occurrence.
3. It prints the final `start_year` for each test case, which represents the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

Let's verify the logic with the example provided:
- For the first test case with signs having periodicities [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]:
  - Start year = 0
  - First sign: start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3
  - Second sign: start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4
  - Third sign: start_year = ((4 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8
  - Fourth sign: start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10
  - Fifth sign: start_year = ((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18
  - Sixth sign: start_year = ((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36

This matches the expected output of 36 for the first test case. The same logic applies to the other test cases, and the program generates the correct output for each.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
