Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the year in which the n-th sign will occur. The logic used in the program is flawed. Specifically, the line `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` does not correctly determine the next occurrence of the i-th sign after the (i-1)-th sign has occurred.

Let's analyze the logic with an example:
Consider the input:
```
1
3
2 3 4
```
The correct sequence of events should be:
1. The first sign occurs in year 2.
2. The second sign should occur in the next multiple of 3 after year 2, which is year 3.
3. The third sign should occur in the next multiple of 4 after year 3, which is year 4.

However, the given program's logic will not yield the correct result:
- For the first sign, `start_year` becomes 2.
- For the second sign, `start_year` should become 3, but the program calculates `start_year = ((2 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 6`, which is incorrect.
- For the third sign, the program will continue with the incorrect `start_year` value.

The correct logic should be to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than the current `start_year`. This can be done using:
```python
start_year = ((start_year + nums[x] - 1) // nums[x]) * nums[x]
```
This ensures that we find the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year + 1`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in determining the next occurrence of each sign.
