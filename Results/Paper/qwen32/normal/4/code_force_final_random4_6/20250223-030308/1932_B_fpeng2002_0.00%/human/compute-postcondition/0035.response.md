To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the provided code snippet on the variables involved:

Initial State: `x` is `x + 1`
```
start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
```

The code modifies `start_year` based on its current value, the value of `x`, and the value of `nums[x]`. The other variables (`x` and `nums`) remain unchanged unless they are part of the expression that changes `start_year`.

Given that `x` is `x + 1`, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the initial state description, as `x` cannot be `x + 1` in a static state. However, for the sake of this exercise, we will assume `x` has a specific value, and we will use the expression as it is provided.

Let's assume `x` has a specific value `k` (where `k` is `x + 1` from the initial state). Then the code modifies `start_year` as follows:

1. `start_year` is incremented by 1.
2. The result is integer divided by `nums[k]`.
3. 1 is added to the result of the integer division.
4. The final result is multiplied by `nums[k]` and assigned back to `start_year`.

The output state will reflect the new value of `start_year` and the unchanged values of `x` and `nums`.

Output State: **`x` is `x + 1`; `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[x + 1] + 1) * nums[x + 1]`; `nums` remains unchanged.**
