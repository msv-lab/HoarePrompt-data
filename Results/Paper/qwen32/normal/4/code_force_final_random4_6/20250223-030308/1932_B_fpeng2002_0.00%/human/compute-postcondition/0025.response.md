To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop modifies the `start_year` variable based on the `nums` list.

The loop iterates over each element `x` in `nums` and updates `start_year` according to the formula:
\[ \text{start\_year} = \left(\left(\frac{\text{start\_year} + 1}{\text{nums}[x]} + 1\right) \times \text{nums}[x]\right) \]

This formula ensures that `start_year` is always a multiple of `nums[x]` and is the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than the current `start_year`.

Let's break down the process:

1. **Initial State**: `start_year` is initialized to 0.
2. **After 1st Iteration**: `start_year` becomes `nums[0]`.
3. **After 2nd Iteration**: `start_year` becomes the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than `nums[0]`.
4. **After 3rd Iteration**: `start_year` becomes the smallest multiple of `nums[2]` that is greater than the value from the 2nd iteration, and so on.

By the end of the loop, `start_year` will be the smallest number that is a multiple of all numbers in `nums` and is greater than the cumulative effect of all previous iterations.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `start_year` will be the least common multiple (LCM) of all the numbers in the `nums` list, adjusted to be the smallest multiple of the last number in the list that is greater than the cumulative effect of all previous iterations.

**Output State: **start_year** is the smallest multiple of the last number in `nums` that is greater than the cumulative effect of all previous iterations, effectively the least common multiple (LCM) of all numbers in `nums` adjusted by the loop's logic.**

In the required format:
