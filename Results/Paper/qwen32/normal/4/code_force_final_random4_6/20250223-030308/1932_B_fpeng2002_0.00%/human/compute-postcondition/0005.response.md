The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `start_year`. This assignment does not affect the values of the other variables (`t`, `num_tests`, `n`, `nums`). Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is greater than 0 or `num_tests` is 0 if it was initially 1; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained by converting space-separated input values to integers; `start_year` is 0.**
