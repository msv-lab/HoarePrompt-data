To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop and how the variables evolve with each iteration.

### Loop Analysis:
- **Initialization**: The loop starts with `num_tests`, which represents the number of test cases to process.
- **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `num_tests > 0`.
- **Loop Body**:
  - Decrement `num_tests` by 1.
  - Read an integer `n` which is the number of elements in the list `nums`.
  - Read a list of integers `nums`.
  - Initialize `start_year` to 0.
  - For each integer `x` in `nums`, update `start_year` using the formula: 
    \[
    \text{start\_year} = \left(\left(\text{start\_year} + 1\right) // \text{nums}[x] + 1\right) * \text{nums}[x]
    \]
  - Print the final value of `start_year`.

### Final Output State:
After all iterations, `num_tests` will be 0 because the loop decrements `num_tests` by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variables `n` and `nums` will be the values from the last test case processed, and `start_year` will be the final value calculated for that last test case.

### Output State:
- `num_tests` will be 0.
- `n` and `nums` will be the values from the last test case.
- `start_year` will be the final value calculated for the last test case.

Output State: **`num_tests` is 0, `n` and `nums` are the values from the last test case, `start_year` is the final value calculated for the last test case.**

In simple terms, the loop will have processed all test cases, and the final output state will reflect the state after the last test case has been processed, with `num_tests` being 0 to indicate that all test cases have been handled.
