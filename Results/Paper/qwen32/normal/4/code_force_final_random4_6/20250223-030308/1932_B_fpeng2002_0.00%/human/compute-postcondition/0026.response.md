To determine what will be printed by the `print(start_year)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state description. Let's break it down step by step.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `start_year` is defined as "the smallest multiple of the last number in `nums` that is greater than the cumulative effect of all previous iterations, effectively the least common multiple (LCM) of all numbers in `nums` adjusted by the loop's logic."

This description suggests that `start_year` is the result of some iterative process involving the list `nums`. Specifically, it seems to be the least common multiple (LCM) of all numbers in `nums`, but adjusted in a manner that ensures it is greater than some cumulative effect from previous iterations. However, the exact details of this adjustment are not explicitly provided.

### Key Points:
- `start_year` is related to the LCM of all numbers in `nums`.
- `start_year` is adjusted to be greater than some cumulative effect from previous iterations.

### Output Description:
Given the description, we can't provide a specific numerical value for `start_year` without knowing the exact values in `nums` and the cumulative effect from previous iterations. However, we can describe `start_year` precisely based on the given information.

### Conclusion:
The `print(start_year)` statement will output the value of `start_year`, which is described as the least common multiple (LCM) of all numbers in `nums`, adjusted to be greater than the cumulative effect of all previous iterations.

Output: **start_year (where start_year is the least common multiple (LCM) of all numbers in `nums`, adjusted to be greater than the cumulative effect of all previous iterations)**
