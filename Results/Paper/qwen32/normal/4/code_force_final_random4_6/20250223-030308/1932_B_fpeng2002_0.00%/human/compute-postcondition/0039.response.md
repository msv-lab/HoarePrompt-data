To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`start_year` Calculation**:
   - `start_year` is calculated using the formula: `((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums) - 1] + 1) * nums[len(nums) - 1]`.
   - This formula suggests that `start_year` is being adjusted based on the last element of the `nums` list (`nums[len(nums) - 1]`).
   - The formula ensures that `start_year` is incremented to the next multiple of the last element of `nums` after adding 1 to `start_year`.

2. **`num_tests` Modification**:
   - `num_tests` is decremented by 1: `num_tests = num_tests - 1`.
   - This indicates that `num_tests` is being updated, but it's not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for the purpose of determining the output.

3. **`n` and `nums`**:
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `nums` is the input list of integers.

### Print Statement:
- The print statement is `print(start_year)`.
- This means we need to determine the final value of `start_year` after the calculation.

### Explanation:
- The formula for `start_year` ensures that `start_year` is adjusted to the next multiple of the last element of `nums` after adding 1 to it.
- However, the exact value of `start_year` before the calculation is not provided, so we can only describe it in terms of the formula and the last element of `nums`.

### Output:
Given the information, the `start_year` will be the next multiple of the last element of `nums` after adding 1 to the initial `start_year`.

Output: **start_year (where start_year is calculated as ((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums) - 1] + 1) * nums[len(nums) - 1])**
