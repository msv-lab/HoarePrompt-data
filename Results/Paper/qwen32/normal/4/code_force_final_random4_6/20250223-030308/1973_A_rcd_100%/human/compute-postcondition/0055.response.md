Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499; `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, then `x` remains 0 and `y` remains `p3`. Otherwise, `x` is set to 1 and `y` is set to `max(1, p3 - 1)` if `p3` is greater than 1, or `y` is set to 0 if `p3` is 1.**
