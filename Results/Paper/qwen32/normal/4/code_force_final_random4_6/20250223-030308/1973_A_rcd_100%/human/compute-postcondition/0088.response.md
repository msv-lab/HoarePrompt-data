Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` - 1 ≤ 499; `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` must be at least 4; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged. The only change is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
