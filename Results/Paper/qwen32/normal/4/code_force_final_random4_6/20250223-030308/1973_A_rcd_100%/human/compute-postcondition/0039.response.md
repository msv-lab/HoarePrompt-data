Let's analyze the given code and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 499\).
- `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the program does not perform any additional actions.
- Otherwise, the loop terminates either by printing `p1 - x + p3` if `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, or by printing `p3` if `y` is less than `x`.

### Code to Analyze:
```python
print(p1 + p2)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(p1 + p2)` statement will simply print the sum of `p1` and `p2`. The conditions and the loop mentioned in the initial state do not affect the value of `p1 + p2` directly. The only condition that affects the program flow is whether `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, but this does not change the values of `p1` and `p2`.

Since the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, it implies that the sum of `p1` and `p2` must be even (because an odd number minus an even number is odd). However, the specific values of `p1` and `p2` are not provided, so we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Output:
The code will print the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
Output: **p1 + p2**
