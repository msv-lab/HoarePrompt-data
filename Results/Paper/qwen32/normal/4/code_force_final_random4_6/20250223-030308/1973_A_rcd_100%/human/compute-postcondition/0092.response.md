To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the loop's behavior based on the given conditions and the states after the first 3 iterations.

### Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` - 1 ≤ 499.
   - `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `x` is 0.
   - `y` is equal to `p3`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `y >= x`.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - If `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, it prints `p1 - x + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, it increments `x` by 1 and decrements `y` by 1.

4. **Post-Loop**:
   - If the loop exits without breaking, it prints `p3`.

### Observations from the Output States after Iterations:
- **After 1 iteration**:
  - If `p1 - 0 <= p2 - p3`, the loop breaks, and `x` remains 0, `y` remains `p3`.
  - Otherwise, `x` becomes 1, and `y` becomes `p3 - 1`.

- **After 2 iterations**:
  - If `p1 - 1 <= p2 - (p3 - 1)`, the loop breaks, and `x` remains 1, `y` remains `p3 - 1`.
  - Otherwise, `x` becomes 2, and `y` becomes `p3 - 2`.

- **After 3 iterations**:
  - If `p1 - 2 <= p2 - (p3 - 2)`, the loop breaks.
  - Otherwise, `x` becomes 3, and `y` becomes `p3 - 3`.

### General Behavior:
- The loop will continue until `p1 - x <= p2 - y` or `y < x`.
- If `y < x`, the loop exits and prints `p3`.
- If `p1 - x <= p2 - y` at any point, the loop prints `p1 - x + p3` and breaks.

### Final Output State:
- The loop will terminate when `x` equals `y` or when `p1 - x <= p2 - y`.
- If the loop exits without breaking, `x` will be `p3` and `y` will be `0`.
- The final output will be either `p1 - x + p3` (if the loop breaks) or `p3` (if the loop exits without breaking).

### Conclusion:
The final output state depends on whether the loop breaks due to `p1 - x <= p2 - y` or exits because `y < x`.

**Output State: **The loop will print either `p1 - x + p3` if the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is met at any point during the iterations, or `p3` if `y` becomes less than `x` without meeting the condition. The values of `x` and `y` will be such that `x` equals `p3` and `y` equals `0` if the loop exits without breaking.**

In simple terms, the final output will be `p1 - x + p3` if the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is satisfied during the loop, otherwise, it will be `p3`.
