Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`. If `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is increased by 1 and `y` is set to `p3 - 2`. If `x` is 1, `p3` must be at least 2 and `y` is `p3 - 1`. If `x` is 2, `p3` must be at least 2.**
