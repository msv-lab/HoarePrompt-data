To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet based on the initial state, we need to carefully analyze the variables and their relationships.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499.
- `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `x` and `y` are such that `y >= x`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(p1 - x + p3)
```

### Analysis:
- The expression `p1 - x + p3` involves the variables `p1`, `x`, and `p3`.
- `p1` and `p3` are integers, and their specific values are not provided, but we know they are part of the input.
- `x` is an integer and is constrained by `y >= x`.

### Output Determination:
The output of the print statement is the result of the expression `p1 - x + p3`. Since the exact values of `p1`, `p3`, and `x` are not provided, we can't compute a specific numerical value. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **p1 - x + p3 (where p1 and p3 are integers from the input and x is an integer such that y >= x)**
