Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` is less than `p1 + p2` and `p3` must be at least 2 if `x` is 1 and `y` is `p3 - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms, the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged. The condition that the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2` with the additional condition that `p3` must be at least 2 if `x` is 1 and `y` is `p3 - 1` still holds. The code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
