Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` - 1 ≤ 499; `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `x` is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged from the initial state. The variable `x` is assigned the value 0.
