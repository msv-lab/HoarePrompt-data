The code snippet `y -= 1` decrements the value of `y` by 1. The initial state specifies that `y` is `p3`. After the execution of the code, `y` becomes `p3 - 1`.

The other variables (`t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `x`) remain unchanged. The conditions that `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `x` is 1, and `p1 - x` is greater than `p2 - y` still hold true. The only change is that `y` is now `p3 - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499; `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `x` is 1; `y` is `p3 - 1`; `p1 - x` is greater than `p2 - (p3 - 1)`**.
