Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` - 1 ≤ 499. This information about `t` is not directly relevant to the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
- `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, which means `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0`. This condition is provided to ensure that the sum of these three numbers is always odd, but it does not affect the calculation in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement is `print(p1 + p2)`, which means the program will output the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

Since the exact values of `p1` and `p2` are not specified, we can't compute a numerical value for `p1 + p2`. However, based on the given information, we can describe the output as the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 and p2 are integers read from the input)**
