The code decrements the value of `y` by 1. Given that `y` was initially equal to `p3`, after the execution of `y -= 1`, the value of `y` becomes `p3 - 1`. All other variables retain their initial values and preconditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`; `x` is 1; `y` is equal to `p3 - 1`; `p1 - x` is greater than `p2 - y`.**
