Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` - 1 ≤ 499; `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` must be at least 1. If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, `x` is 1 and `y` remains `p3`. Otherwise, `x` is 2 and `y` is set to `p3 - 1`. After the code `y -= 1`, `y` is now `p3 - 1` if `x` is 1, or `p3 - 2` if `x` is 2.**

In simpler terms, the value of `y` is decremented by 1. If `x` is 1, `y` becomes `p3 - 1`. If `x` is 2, `y` becomes `p3 - 2`. All other conditions and variable values remain the same.
