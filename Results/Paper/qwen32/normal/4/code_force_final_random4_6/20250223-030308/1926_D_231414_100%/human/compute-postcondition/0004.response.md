The code reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `data`. The initial state specifies that `times` is an input integer greater than 0 and `n` is an input integer. These variables are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`times` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
