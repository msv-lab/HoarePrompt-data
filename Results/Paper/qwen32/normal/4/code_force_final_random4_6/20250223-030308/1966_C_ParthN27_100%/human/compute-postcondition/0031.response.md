The code snippet `ans ^= 1` performs a bitwise XOR operation on the variable `ans` with the value `1`. Given that the initial state does not specify the value of `ans`, we can only describe the transformation in terms of its effect on `ans`. If `ans` was `0`, it will become `1`; if `ans` was `1`, it will become `0`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` with `0` prepended to it, `i` is 2, `ans` is the bitwise XOR of its previous value with 1**.
