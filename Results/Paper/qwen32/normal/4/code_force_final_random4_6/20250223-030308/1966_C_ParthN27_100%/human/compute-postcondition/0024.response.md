Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` with `0` prepended to it, `i` is `n-1`. If the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is greater than 1, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is 1 or less.**
