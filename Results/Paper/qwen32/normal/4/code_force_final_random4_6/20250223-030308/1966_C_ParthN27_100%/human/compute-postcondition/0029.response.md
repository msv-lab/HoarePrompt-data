The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of these variables. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be 2.

State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` with `0` prepended to it, `i` is 2**
