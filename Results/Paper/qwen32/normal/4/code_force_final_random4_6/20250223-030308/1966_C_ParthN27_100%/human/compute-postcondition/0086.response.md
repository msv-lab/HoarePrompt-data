The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current index, and `n` must be greater than 0. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Given that `s` now contains the element `arr[i]` in addition to its previous elements, we don't need to modify `s` or `arr` as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**
