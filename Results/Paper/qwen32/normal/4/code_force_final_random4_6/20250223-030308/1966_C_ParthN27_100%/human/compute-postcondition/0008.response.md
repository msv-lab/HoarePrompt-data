The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `n` must be greater than the current value of `i`, which is now 2.

State: **`t` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`, `i` is 2**
