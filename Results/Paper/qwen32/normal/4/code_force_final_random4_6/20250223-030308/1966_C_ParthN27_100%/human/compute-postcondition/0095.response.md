The variable `n` is updated to the length of the list `s`. The list `s` is described as a sorted list of unique elements from `arr` with `0` prepended. Therefore, `n` will now hold the length of this modified list `s`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the length of the sorted list `s` which contains unique elements from `arr` with `0` prepended, `arr` is the new list of integers from the input, `s` is a sorted list of unique elements from `arr` with `0` prepended, `i` is the integer input from the user, `ans` is 1.**
