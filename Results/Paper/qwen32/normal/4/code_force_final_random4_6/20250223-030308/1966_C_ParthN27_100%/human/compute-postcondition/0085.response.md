The code snippet provided adds the element at index `i` of the list `arr` to the set `s`. Given the initial state, we know `n` must be greater than 0, but this condition does not directly impact the execution of the given code snippet.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `s` now contains the element `arr[i]` in addition to its previous elements.**
