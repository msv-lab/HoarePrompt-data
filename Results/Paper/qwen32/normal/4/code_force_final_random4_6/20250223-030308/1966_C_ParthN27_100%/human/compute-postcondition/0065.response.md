The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is in the range from 1 to `n-2` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1`, which means the loop will not execute again with `i` being `n-1`. To make the loop execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next valid value within the range, which is `n-2`.

State: **`t` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a new list of integers from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` with a `0` prepended to it, `i` is `n-2`, and `ans` is 1 if the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is greater than 1; otherwise, `ans` is 0.**
