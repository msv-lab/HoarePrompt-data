The value of `n` is reassigned to the integer value of the input provided. The other variables (`t`, `arr`, `s`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the integer value of the input, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` with `0` prepended to it, `i` is either 1 if `n` was 2, or the last index reached before the loop ended, and `ans` is either 0 or 1.**
