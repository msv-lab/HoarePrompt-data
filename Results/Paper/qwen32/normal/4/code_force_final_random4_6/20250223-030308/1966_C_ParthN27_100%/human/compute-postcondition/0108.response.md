Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is the length of the sorted list `s` which contains unique elements from `arr` with `0` prepended and must be greater than 2, `arr` is the new list of integers from the input, `s` is a sorted list of unique elements from `arr` with `0` prepended and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2. If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `ans` is 1.**
