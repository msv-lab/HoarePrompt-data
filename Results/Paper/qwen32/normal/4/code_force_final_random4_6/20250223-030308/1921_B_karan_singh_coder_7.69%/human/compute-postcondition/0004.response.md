`s1` is assigned the value of the count of the character '1' in the string `s`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a string input by the user, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, and `s1` is the count of '1's in `s`.

Output State: **`t` is a string input by the user; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a string input by the user; `s1` is the count of '1's in `s`.**
