Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. s and f are strings of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    t = input()
    s1 = s.count('1')
    t1 = t.count('1')
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        cnt += s[i] != t[i]
    if s1 == t1:
        print(s1 if cnt else 0)
    else:
        d = abs(s1 - t1)
        print((cnt - d) // 2 + d)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a string input by the user; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a string input by the user; `s1` is the count of '1's in `s`; `t1` is the count of '1's in `t`; `cnt` is the number of positions where the characters in `s` and `t` differ; `i` is `n-1`. If the count of '1's in `s` is equal to the count of '1's in `t`, no additional variable `d` is defined. Otherwise, `d` is defined as the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a new string input by the user; `n` is a new input integer; `s` is the new string input by the user; `s1` is the count of '1's in the new `s`; `t1` is the count of '1's in the new `t`; `cnt` is the total number of positions where `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`; `i` is `n-1`. If `s1` is equal to `t1`, no additional variable `d` is defined. Otherwise, `d` is defined as the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the new string input by the user, `n` is the new input integer (must be greater than 0), `s` is the new string input by the user, `s1` is the count of '1's in the new `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in the new `t`, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`. If the count of '1's in `s` is equal to the count of '1's in `t` (i.e., `s1 == t1`), then no additional changes are made to `d`. Otherwise, `d` is set to the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1` (i.e., `d = abs(s1 - t1)`).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
