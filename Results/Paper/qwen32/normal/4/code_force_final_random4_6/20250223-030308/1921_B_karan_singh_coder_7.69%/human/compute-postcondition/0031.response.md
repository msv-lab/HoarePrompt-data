The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is a new string input by the user; `n` is a new input integer that must be greater than 1; `s` is the new string input by the user; `s1` is the count of '1's in the new `s`; `t1` is the count of '1's in the new `t`; `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `t[0]`, otherwise `cnt` remains 0; `i` is 1; if the count of '1's in the new `s` is equal to the count of '1's in the new `t`, no additional variable `d` is defined. Otherwise, `d` is defined as the absolute difference between the new `s1` and `t1`.**
