The code snippet `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` increments the variable `cnt` by 1 if the characters at index `i` in the strings `s` and `t` are not equal. Given that `i` is 2, the comparison is made between `s[2]` and `t[2]`. 

Output State: **`t` is a string input by the user; `n` must be greater than 1; `s` is a string input by the user; `s1` is the count of '1's in `s`; `t1` is the count of '1's in `t`; `cnt` is 1 if `s[0] != t[0]` else `cnt` is 0, and `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `s[1] != t[1]`, and `cnt` is further incremented by 1 if `s[2] != t[2]`; `i` is 2.**

In simpler terms, the output state is that `cnt` has been incremented by 1 if `s[2]` is not equal to `t[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
