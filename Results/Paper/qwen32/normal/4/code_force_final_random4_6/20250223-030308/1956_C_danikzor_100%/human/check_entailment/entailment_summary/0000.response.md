### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to verify whether it adheres to the problem's requirements and produces the correct output for all valid inputs.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have an `n x n` matrix filled with zeroes.
   - We can perform two types of operations:
     - Type 1: Assign values to a row `i` using a permutation `p`.
     - Type 2: Assign values to a column `i` using a permutation `p`.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix using no more than `2n` operations.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.
   - It calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix elements using the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`.
   - It prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, which is `2n`.
   - It then prints `2n` lines, each consisting of a sequence that describes an operation:
     - The first line in each pair is a Type 1 operation that assigns the permutation `n, n-1, ..., 2, 1` to a row.
     - The second line in each pair is a Type 2 operation that assigns the same permutation `n, n-1, ..., 2, 1` to a column.

3. **Verification:**
   - **Max Sum Calculation:** The formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` is the sum of squares of the first `n` natural numbers. This is correct as the maximum sum can be achieved by filling the matrix with the numbers `n, n-1, ..., 2, 1` in a way that all distinct values are used.
   - **Operations:** The program performs `2n` operations, which is within the allowed limit. The operations described ensure that each row and each column contains the numbers `n, n-1, ..., 2, 1`.
   - **Output Format:** The output format matches the problem's requirements. For each test case, it prints the maximum sum, the number of operations, and the sequence of operations.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and prints the appropriate sequence of operations to achieve this sum within the allowed limit of `2n` operations.

### Correctness: **True**
