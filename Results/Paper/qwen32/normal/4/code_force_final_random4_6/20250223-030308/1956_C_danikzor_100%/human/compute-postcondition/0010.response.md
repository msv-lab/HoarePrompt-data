Let's break down the code snippet and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

Initial State:
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `i` is `n-1`.

Given the print statement:
```
print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

1. The first value to be printed is `2`, which is a constant.
2. The second value to be printed is `i`. Since `i` is defined as `n-1`, this means `i` will be one less than `n`.
3. The `*range(n, 0, -1)` part will expand to a sequence of numbers starting from `n` down to `1` (inclusive). This is because `range(n, 0, -1)` generates numbers starting from `n` and decrements by 1 until it reaches `1`.

Putting it all together:
- The first value printed is `2`.
- The second value printed is `i`, which is `n-1`.
- The remaining values printed are the numbers from `n` down to `1`.

For example, if `n` were `5`, then:
- `i` would be `5-1 = 4`.
- The range would be `range(5, 0, -1)`, which expands to `5, 4, 3, 2, 1`.

Thus, the output for `n = 5` would be `2, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1`.

In general, the output will be `2, n-1, n, n-1, ..., 1`.

Output: **2, n-1, n, n-1, ..., 1 (where n is at least 2 and the range goes from n down to 1)**
