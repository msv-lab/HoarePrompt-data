Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the input, prints the sum of squares of the first `n` natural numbers and twice the value of `n`, and then prints `2n` lines. Each pair of lines consists of a sequence starting with `1` and `2`, followed by the current index `i` and the sequence `n, n-1, ..., 2, 1`. The function does not return any value.**
