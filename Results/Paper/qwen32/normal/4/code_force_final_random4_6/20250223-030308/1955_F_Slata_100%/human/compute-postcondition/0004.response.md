The code snippet provided reads four integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The variable `i` is mentioned to be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, but the provided code snippet does not affect `i`. The initial state indicates that `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers obtained from the input.

Since the code snippet is reading new values for `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` from the input, the previous values of these variables are overwritten. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `i` is not affected by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are new integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**
