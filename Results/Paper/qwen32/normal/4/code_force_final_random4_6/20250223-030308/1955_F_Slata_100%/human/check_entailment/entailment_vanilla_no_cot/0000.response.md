To determine if the given Python program is correct, we need to analyze the problem and the provided solution.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally. Bob wins if the XOR of all remaining numbers in the sequence is zero.

- **XOR Properties:**
  - XOR of any number with itself is 0 (e.g., `x ^ x = 0`).
  - XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself (e.g., `x ^ 0 = x`).
  - XOR is commutative and associative.

- **Winning Strategy:**
  - Bob wins if the XOR of the sequence is zero.
  - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to leave sequences with an even number of each number that contributes to a non-zero XOR, because pairs of identical numbers will cancel each other out.

### Key Observations

- **Numbers and Their XOR:**
  - `1 XOR 1 = 0`
  - `2 XOR 2 = 0`
  - `3 XOR 3 = 0`
  - `4 XOR 4 = 0`
  - `1 XOR 2 XOR 4 = 7` (non-zero)
  - `1 XOR 3 = 2` (non-zero)
  - `2 XOR 3 = 1` (non-zero)
  - `3 XOR 4 = 7` (non-zero)
  - `1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0`
  - `1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 4 = 4` (non-zero)

- **Strategy:**
  - If there are an even number of each number, the XOR will be zero.
  - If there is an odd number of each number, the XOR will be non-zero.
  - Eve should aim to leave sequences with an even number of each number that contributes to a non-zero XOR.

### Program Analysis

The provided program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by summing up the integer divisions of each count by 2 (which gives the number of pairs) and then adding 1 if there are three odd counts of numbers. This logic is based on the idea that:

- Each pair of the same number cancels out.
- If there are three odd counts, the XOR will be zero.

Let's test the program with the given examples:

1. **Input:** `1 1 1 0`
   - Output: `1` (Bob wins once when no numbers are removed)
   - Explanation: `1 XOR 1 XOR 1 = 1` (non-zero), but by removing one, we can get `1 XOR 1 = 0` (zero).

2. **Input:** `1 0 1 2`
   - Output: `1` (Bob wins once)
   - Explanation: By removing one `1` and one `3`, we get `2 XOR 4 = 6` (non-zero), but `2 XOR 2 = 0` (zero).

3. **Input:** `2 2 2 0`
   - Output: `3` (Bob wins three times)
   - Explanation: By removing pairs, we can achieve sequences with zero XOR.

4. **Input:** `3 3 2 0`
   - Output: `3` (Bob wins three times)
   - Explanation: By removing pairs, we can achieve sequences with zero XOR.

5. **Input:** `0 9 9 9`
   - Output: `12` (Bob wins twelve times)
   - Explanation: By removing pairs, we can achieve sequences with zero XOR.

The program seems to correctly calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the provided logic.

### Conclusion

The program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

**Correctness: True**
