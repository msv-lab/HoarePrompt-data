### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program, verifying the logic and calculations step-by-step.

#### Problem Recap:
- Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of the sequence is non-zero.
- Bob wins if the XOR is zero.
- Eve removes one number at a time, aiming to maximize Bob's wins.
- The XOR of a sequence is zero if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all even (since 4 does not affect the XOR of 1, 2, and 3).

#### Key Insight:
- For Bob to win, the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s must be even.
- Eve can make the counts even by removing one of each odd-counted number (1, 2, or 3).

#### Calculation:
- The number of times Bob can win is determined by the number of odd counts among 1s, 2s, and 3s.
- If there are three odd counts, Eve can remove one of each to make all counts even, allowing Bob to win once more.

The formula in the code is:
```python
a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)
```
- `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` counts the number of pairs that can be formed from 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
- `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` checks if all of 1s, 2s, and 3s have odd counts. If so, it adds one more to the count, allowing Bob to win one more time.

#### Verification with Examples:

1. **Input:** `1 1 1 0`
   - Odd counts: 1, 1, 1
   - Expected Bob wins: 1
   - Calculation: `1 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 0 // 2 + int(1 % 2 + 1 % 2 + 1 % 2 == 3) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`

2. **Input:** `1 0 1 2`
   - Odd counts: 1, 1
   - Expected Bob wins: 1
   - Calculation: `1 // 2 + 0 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 2 // 2 + int(1 % 2 + 0 % 2 + 1 % 2 == 3) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 1`

3. **Input:** `2 2 2 0`
   - Even counts: 2, 2, 2
   - Expected Bob wins: 3
   - Calculation: `2 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 0 // 2 + int(2 % 2 + 2 % 2 + 2 % 2 == 3) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3`

4. **Input:** `3 3 2 0`
   - Odd counts: 3, 3
   - Even count: 2
   - Expected Bob wins: 3
   - Calculation: `3 // 2 + 3 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 0 // 2 + int(3 % 2 + 3 % 2 + 2 % 2 == 3) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3`

5. **Input:** `0 9 9 9`
   - Odd counts: 9, 9, 9
   - Expected Bob wins: 12
   - Calculation: `0 // 2 + 9 // 2 + 9 // 2 + 9 // 2 + int(0 % 2 + 9 % 2 + 9 % 2 == 3) = 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 13`

There is indeed a discrepancy in the last example calculation. The correct formula should be:
```python
a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 >= 1)
```
This formula correctly counts the number of pairs and accounts for the case where at least one of the counts is odd.

### Conclusion:
The formula in the code is incorrect. The term `d // 2` is unnecessary and the term `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` is too restrictive. The correct formula should account for any odd counts among 1s, 2s, and 3s.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final:
Final: **False**
