To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem and the logic implemented in the code.

The game involves a sequence of integers where each integer is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero. Bob wins if the XOR is zero. Eve removes one number at a time, and the goal is to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

### Key Observations:
1. **XOR Properties**:
   - XOR of two identical numbers is 0.
   - XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself.
   - XOR is commutative and associative.

2. **Bob's Winning Condition**:
   - Bob wins if the XOR of the remaining numbers is 0.
   - For the XOR to be 0, pairs of identical numbers must exist, and the overall count of numbers with odd occurrences must be even (including none).

3. **Strategy for Eve**:
   - Eve should aim to maximize the number of times the XOR is 0.
   - This can be achieved by ensuring that pairs of identical numbers are removed, and the remaining numbers have an even count of odd occurrences.

### Analysis of the Code:
- The code calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by considering the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
- `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` counts the number of pairs that can be removed, which ensures that the XOR of these pairs is 0.
- `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` checks if there are exactly three numbers with an odd count. If so, removing one of these will make the total count of numbers with odd occurrences even, allowing Bob to win.

### Verification with Examples:
1. **First Example**:
   - Input: `1 1 1 0`
   - Calculation: `1 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 0 // 2 + int(1 % 2 + 1 % 2 + 1 % 2 == 3)`
   - Result: `0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
   - Bob wins once when no numbers are removed.

2. **Second Example**:
   - Input: `1 0 1 2`
   - Calculation: `1 // 2 + 0 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 2 // 2 + int(1 % 2 + 0 % 2 + 1 % 2 == 3)`
   - Result: `0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 1`
   - Bob wins once if Eve removes one 1 and one 3.

3. **Third Example**:
   - Input: `2 2 2 0`
   - Calculation: `2 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 0 // 2 + int(2 % 2 + 2 % 2 + 2 % 2 == 3)`
   - Result: `1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3`
   - Bob wins three times by removing pairs of 1s, 2s, and 3s.

4. **Fourth Example**:
   - Input: `3 3 2 0`
   - Calculation: `3 // 2 + 3 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 0 // 2 + int(3 % 2 + 3 % 2 + 2 % 2 == 3)`
   - Result: `1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3`
   - Bob wins three times by removing pairs and ensuring the remaining numbers have an even count of odd occurrences.

5. **Fifth Example**:
   - Input: `0 9 9 9`
   - Calculation: `0 // 2 + 9 // 2 + 9 // 2 + 9 // 2 + int(0 % 2 + 9 % 2 + 9 % 2 == 3)`
   - Result: `0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 12`
   - Bob wins twelve times by removing pairs and ensuring the remaining numbers have an even count of odd occurrences.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by considering the counts of each number and ensuring pairs are removed optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
