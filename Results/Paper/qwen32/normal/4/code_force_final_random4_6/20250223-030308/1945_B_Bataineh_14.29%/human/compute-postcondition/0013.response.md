The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `t` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, and `m` is the third input integer. The values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged regardless of whether `m < a` or `m < b`.**
