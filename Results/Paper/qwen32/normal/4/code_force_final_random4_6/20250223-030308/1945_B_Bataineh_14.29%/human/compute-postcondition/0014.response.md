The code snippet `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m` respectively. The initial values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are no longer relevant after this assignment because the code overwrites `a`, `b`, and `m` with the new input values. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, and `m` is the third input integer.**
