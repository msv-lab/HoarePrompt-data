Precondition: **Each test case consists of three integers a, b, and m (1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18), where a is the frequency of launching for the first installation, b is the frequency of launching for the second installation, and m is the time the firework is visible in the sky. The input begins with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases.**
