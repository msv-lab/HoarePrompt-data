Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic in the program is flawed and does not account for the overlaps of fireworks' visibility periods based on the given frequencies and visibility duration.

Let's analyze the logic and identify a specific case where the program fails:

The program uses the following logic:
```python
if m < a or m < b:
    print(2)
else:
    print(m // a + m // b + 2)
```

This logic is incorrect for several reasons:
1. The condition `if m < a or m < b` is not correctly handling the scenario where the visibility period is less than the frequency of either installation. It simply returns 2, which is not necessarily correct.
2. The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` is not accounting for the overlaps between the visibility periods of fireworks launched by the two installations. It simply sums the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period and adds 2, which is incorrect.

Let's consider a specific test case to demonstrate the issue:

**Test Case:**
```
1
2 3 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Fireworks from the first installation are launched at times 2, 4.
- Fireworks from the second installation are launched at times 3, 6.
- Visibility periods:
  - First installation: [2, 7], [4, 9]
  - Second installation: [3, 8], [6, 11]
- Overlaps:
  - At time 3: Both fireworks from the first and second installations are visible.
  - At time 4: Both fireworks from the first and second installations are visible.
  - At time 5: Both fireworks from the first and second installations are visible.
  - At time 6: Both fireworks from the first and second installations are visible.
- Maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously: 4

**Program Output:**
```
5
```

The program calculates `5 // 2 + 5 // 3 + 2 = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5`, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the correct answer is `False`.
