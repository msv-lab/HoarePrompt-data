Postcondition: **A is a positive integer, g is an adjacency list representing the tree with n vertices, k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, stack is `[(1, 1)]`, visited is an empty set, r is 0, x is 1, p is 1. If `d[x]` is greater than or equal to A, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `d[x]` is updated to 2.**
