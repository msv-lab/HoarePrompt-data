Output State: **A is a positive integer, g is an adjacency list representing the tree with n vertices, k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, stack is `[(1, 1)]`, visited is an empty set, d is `{1: 1}`, r is 1, x is 1, p is 1, and the current value of `d[x]` is greater than or equal to A. If `x` equals 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

In natural language, the only change is that the value of `r` has been incremented by 1, making `r` equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
