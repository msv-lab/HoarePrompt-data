Output State: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree with `n` vertices such that `g[1]` contains at least one neighbor, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k < n`, `stack` is `[(1, 1), (node, x)]`, `visited` is `{1}`, `d` is `{1: 1}`, `r` is `0`, `x` is `1`, `p` is `1`, `node` is `next_node` where `next_node` is the next element in `g[1]` after the current `node`.**

Explanation: The `stack` has been updated to include the tuple `(node, x)`, where `node` is `next_node` and `x` is `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
