#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, k is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n, and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b in the tree.
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        
        g[b].append(a)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b in the tree, and `g` is a list of `n + 1` lists where for each tuple (a, b) in `edges`, `g[a]` contains `b` and `g[b]` contains `a`.
    c = 0
    l = 1
    r = n // k
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
        
    #State: - `l` will be `r + 1`.
    #- `r` will be the maximum value for which `check(mid)` returned `True`.
    #- `c` remains 0 as it is not modified in the loop.
    #- `mid` is not a variable that retains a specific value after the loop terminates; it is recalculated in each iteration.
    #
    #Thus, the final output state of the loop is:
    #
    #Output State:
    print(r)
    #This is printed: r (where r is the maximum value for which check(mid) returned True)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a tree, an integer `k` representing the number of edges to be removed (where 1 <= k < n), and a list of tuples `edges` where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b in the tree. The function determines and prints the maximum value for which a certain condition (checked by the `check` function) holds true after attempting to remove `k` edges from the tree.
