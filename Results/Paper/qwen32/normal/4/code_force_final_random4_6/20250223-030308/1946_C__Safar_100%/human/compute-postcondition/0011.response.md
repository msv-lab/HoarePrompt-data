The code snippet appends a tuple `(node, x)` to the `stack`. This means the `stack` will now have an additional element at the end.

Given the initial state, the variables `A`, `g`, `k`, `visited`, `d`, `r`, `x`, and `p` remain unchanged. The only variable that changes is `stack`, which now includes the new tuple `(node, x)`.

Output State: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree with `n` vertices such that `g[1]` contains at least one neighbor, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k < n`, `stack` is `[(1, 1), (node, x)]`, `visited` is `{1}`, `d` is `{1: 1}`, `r` is `0`, `x` is `1`, `p` is `1`, and `x` is in `visited`. Additionally, `node` is not equal to `p`.**
