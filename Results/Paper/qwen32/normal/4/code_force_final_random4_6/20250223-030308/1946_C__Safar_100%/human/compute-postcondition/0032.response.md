Given the initial state:

- `l` is set to `r + 1`.
- `r` is the maximum value for which the function `check(mid)` returned `True`.
- `c` remains 0 as it is not modified in the loop.
- `mid` is not retained after the loop terminates; it changes with each iteration.

The `print(r)` statement outputs the value of `r`, which is described as the maximum value for which `check(mid)` returned `True`.

Since the specific value of `r` is dependent on the behavior of the `check(mid)` function and the input data, we cannot provide a concrete numerical value for `r`. However, based on the precondition, we know exactly what `r` represents.

Therefore, the output of the `print(r)` statement is:

Output: **r (where r is the maximum value for which check(mid) returned True)**
