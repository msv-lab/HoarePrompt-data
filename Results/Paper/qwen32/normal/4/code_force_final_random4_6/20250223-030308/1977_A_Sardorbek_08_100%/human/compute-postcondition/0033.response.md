The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. This string is not dependent on any variables or conditions described in the initial state. The initial state provides information about various variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `i`) and their constraints, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
