Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description:

The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube in each move. To determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the following logic should be used:

1. If `n` is equal to `m`, it's possible to have `m` cubes by adding one cube in each of the `n` moves.
2. If `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible because Nikita cannot add more cubes than the number of moves he has.
3. If `n` is greater than `m`, it's possible to have `m` cubes if the difference `(n - m)` is even. This is because each pair of moves (one addition and one subtraction) can be used to adjust the number of cubes by 0, and any remaining moves need to be even to balance out (i.e., adding and then removing, or removing and then adding).

The provided program checks these conditions but has a mistake in the third condition. The program checks if `b % 2 == c % 2`, which is incorrect. Instead, it should check if `(b - c) % 2 == 0` to determine if the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even.

Here's the corrected part of the logic:
```python
if b == c:
    print('YES')
elif b < c:
    print('NO')
elif (b - c) % 2 == 0:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
```

Since the provided program does not correctly implement the third condition, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
