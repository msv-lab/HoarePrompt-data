Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is greater than or equal to 1, `b` is the first integer from the input, `c` is the second integer from the input, `q` is a tuple `(b, c)`. No additional changes occur regardless of whether `b` is equal to `c` or if they have different parities.**
