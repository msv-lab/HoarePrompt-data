You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is an integer representing the number of iterations, `i` is equal to `a` (indicating the loop has finished all iterations), and `b` and `c` are the last pair of integers read from the input. The variable `q` is the tuple `(b, c)` from the last iteration. The state of `t`, `n`, and `m` remains unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `a` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c`. It then prints 'YES' if `b` equals `c`, 'NO' if `b` is less than `c`, 'Yes' if `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), and 'No' otherwise. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube in one move.
- Given `n` moves and `m` cubes, determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes at the end.
- The output should be "Yes" or "No" (case-insensitive).

### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Case 1: `b == c`**
   - If the number of moves `b` is equal to the number of cubes `c`, the program outputs "YES".
   - This is correct because if `b` moves are all additions, it's possible to have `c` cubes.

2. **Case 2: `b < c`**
   - If the number of moves `b` is less than the number of cubes `c`, the program outputs "NO".
   - This is incorrect because if `b` is even and greater than or equal to `c`, it's possible to add `c` cubes and then remove `(b - c)` cubes to still have `c` cubes.

3. **Case 3: `b % 2 == c % 2`**
   - If the number of moves `b` and the number of cubes `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), the program outputs "Yes".
   - This is correct because starting from 0 cubes, an even number of moves can result in an even number of cubes, and an odd number of moves can result in an odd number of cubes.

4. **Case 4: `b % 2 != c % 2`**
   - If the number of moves `b` and the number of cubes `c` have different parities, the program outputs "No".
   - This is correct because an even number of additions/removals cannot result in an odd number of cubes, and vice versa.

### Incorrect Case:
The program incorrectly handles the case where `b < c`. Specifically, if `b` is even and greater than or equal to `c`, it should be possible to end up with `c` cubes by adding `c` cubes and then removing `(b - c)` cubes.

### Example of Incorrectness:
- Input: `2 1`
- Expected Output: "Yes" (Nikita can add 1 cube and then remove 1 cube to have 1 cube at the end).
- Actual Output: "NO"

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the handling of the case where `b < c`.

Correctness: **False**.
