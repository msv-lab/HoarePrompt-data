Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
2. `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
3. `a` is greater than or equal to 1.
4. `b` is the first integer from the input.
5. `c` is the second integer from the input.
6. `q` is a tuple `(b, c)`.
7. If `b` is equal to `c`, no additional changes occur.
8. If `b` is not equal to `c`, no additional changes occur unless `b` and `c` have different parities, in which case `b % 2` is not equal to `c % 2`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement in the code snippet simply prints the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes various variables and conditions, but none of these conditions or variables affect the print statement directly. The print statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `q`. It will always print `'YES'` regardless of the input values.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
