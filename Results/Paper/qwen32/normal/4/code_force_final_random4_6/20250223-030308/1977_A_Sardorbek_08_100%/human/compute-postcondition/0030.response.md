The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about various variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `i`) but these are not used in the provided `print` statement. Since the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables, their values do not affect the output.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
2. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided in the statement.
3. None of the variables mentioned in the initial state (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `i`) are used in the `print` statement.
4. Therefore, the output will be the string `'YES'` as it is.

Output: **YES**
