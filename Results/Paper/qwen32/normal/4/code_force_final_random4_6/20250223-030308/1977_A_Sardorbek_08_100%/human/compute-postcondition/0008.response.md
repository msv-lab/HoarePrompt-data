The given `print` statement in the Python code snippet is `print('NO')`. This statement does not depend on any variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`) and their constraints or relationships.
2. However, the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables.
3. The statement `print('NO')` directly outputs the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **NO**
