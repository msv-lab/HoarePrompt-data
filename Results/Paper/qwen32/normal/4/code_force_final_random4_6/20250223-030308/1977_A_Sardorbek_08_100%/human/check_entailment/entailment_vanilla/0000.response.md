Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

Nikita can perform two types of moves:
1. Add 1 cube to the tower.
2. Remove 1 cube from the tower.

The goal is to determine if, after `n` moves, the tower can have exactly `m` cubes.

### Key Observations:
1. **Initial State**: The tower starts with 0 cubes.
2. **Possible Moves**: Each move either adds or removes 1 cube.
3. **Parity**: The parity (odd or even nature) of the number of cubes in the tower will alternate with each move. Starting from 0 (even), after an odd number of moves, the number of cubes will be odd, and after an even number of moves, the number of cubes will be even.

### Conditions to Determine the Possibility:
1. **Equal Moves and Cubes**: If `n == m`, it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves by adding 1 cube in each move.
2. **More Moves than Cubes**: If `n < m`, it's impossible because Nikita cannot add more cubes than the number of moves.
3. **Parity Check**: If `n > m`, the number of cubes `m` must have the same parity as `n` (both odd or both even) because the parity alternates with each move.

### Program Analysis

Let's compare the logic in the provided program with the conditions we derived:

1. **First Condition**: `if b == c: print('YES')`
   - This checks if `n == m`. If true, it correctly prints "YES".
   
2. **Second Condition**: `elif b < c: print('NO')`
   - This checks if `n < m`. If true, it correctly prints "NO".
   
3. **Third Condition**: `elif b % 2 == c % 2: print('Yes')`
   - This checks if `n` and `m` have the same parity. If true, it correctly prints "YES".
   
4. **Else Condition**: `else: print('No')`
   - This handles the remaining cases, which are when `n > m` and `n` and `m` have different parity. It correctly prints "NO".

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic based on the conditions derived from the problem statement. It handles all possible cases and provides the correct output for each scenario.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
