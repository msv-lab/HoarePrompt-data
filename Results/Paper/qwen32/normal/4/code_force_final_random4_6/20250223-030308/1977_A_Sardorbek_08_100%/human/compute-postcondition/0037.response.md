Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is an integer representing the number of iterations, `i` is equal to `a` (indicating the loop has finished all iterations), and `b` and `c` are the last pair of integers read from the input. The variable `q` is the tuple `(b, c)` from the last iteration. The state of `t`, `n`, and `m` remains unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `a`, indicating that the loop has completed. The variables `b` and `c` will hold the values from the last iteration, and `q` will be the tuple `(b, c)` from that last iteration. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` will remain the same as they were initially, as they are not modified within the loop.
