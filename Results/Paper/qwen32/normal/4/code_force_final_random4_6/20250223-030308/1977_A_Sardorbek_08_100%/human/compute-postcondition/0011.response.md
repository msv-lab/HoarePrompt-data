The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state provides several conditions and variable definitions, but none of these directly affect the content of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `q`.

Here is the detailed reasoning:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100.
- `a` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `b` and `c` are integers where `b` is the first integer from the input, `c` is the second integer from the input, `b` is not equal to `c`, `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, and `b` and `c` have the same parity (both are either even or odd).
- `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.

However, these variable values do not influence the `print` statement, which simply outputs the string `'Yes'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **Yes**
