Output State: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is the length of the array, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n`, `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`**

In this output state, the variables `array`, `find`, `n`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged from the initial state. The new variable `mid` is calculated as the integer division of the sum of `l` and `r` by 2.
