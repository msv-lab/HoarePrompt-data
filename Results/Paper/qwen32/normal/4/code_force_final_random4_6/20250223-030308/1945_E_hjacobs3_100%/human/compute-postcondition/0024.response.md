Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.
2. `find` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{find} \leq n\).
3. `n` is the length of the array.
4. `l` is the largest index such that `array[l] <= find`.
5. `r` is \(l + 1\).
6. `l` is equal to the index of `find` in `array`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(0)
```

### Analysis:
The provided code snippet contains a single `print` statement that outputs the integer `0`. The value to be printed is explicitly given as `0` and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state.

### Output:
Since the `print` statement directly outputs `0`, the value of the variables and objects described in the initial state do not affect the output.

Output: **0**
