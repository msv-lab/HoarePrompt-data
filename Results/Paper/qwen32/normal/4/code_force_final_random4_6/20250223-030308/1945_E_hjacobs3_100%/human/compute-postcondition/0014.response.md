The `while` loop condition is `r - l > 1`. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, the difference between `r` and `l` must be greater than 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.
- `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `r` is at least `l + 2`.
- `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`.
- If `array[mid] <= find`, then `l` is updated to `mid`. Otherwise, `r` is updated to `mid`.

Since `r` is at least `l + 2` at the end of the previous iteration, the condition `r - l > 1` is already satisfied. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is at least `l + 2`, `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`. If `array[mid] <= find`, then `l` is updated to `mid`. Otherwise, `r` is updated to `mid`.**
