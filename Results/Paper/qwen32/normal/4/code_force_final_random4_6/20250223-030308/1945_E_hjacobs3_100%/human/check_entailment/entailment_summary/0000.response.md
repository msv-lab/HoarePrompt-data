### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step-by-step:

1. **Problem Overview:**
   - We have a permutation `p` of integers from 1 to `n`.
   - We need to find an integer `x` in this permutation using a modified binary search.
   - Before applying the binary search, we can perform at most 2 swaps to ensure that the binary search will correctly identify `x` at the end.

2. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - Initialize `l = 0` and `r = n`.
   - While `r - l > 1`:
     - Compute `mid = (l + r) // 2`.
     - If `array[mid] <= x`, set `l = mid`.
     - Otherwise, set `r = mid`.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads input for multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the integer `x` to find.
   - It then reads the permutation `array`.
   - The function `func_1` is called with `array` and `x`.
   - The function performs the binary search and sets `l` to the largest index such that `array[l] <= x`.
   - If `l` is not the index of `x` in `array`, it prints `1` and suggests a swap to make `array[l]` equal to `x`.
   - If `l` is already the index of `x`, it prints `0`.

4. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The program does not actually perform the swaps; it only suggests them.
   - The program does not handle the case where two swaps are needed.
   - The program does not modify the array based on the suggested swaps before performing the binary search.

5. **Expected Behavior:**
   - The program should perform up to 2 swaps to ensure that after the binary search, `array[l]` is equal to `x`.
   - The output should include the number of swaps performed and the indices of the elements to be swapped.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The current implementation does not correctly solve the problem because it does not actually perform the swaps and does not handle the case where two swaps are needed.
   - The function `func_1` only suggests a swap but does not modify the array or handle the scenario where two swaps are necessary.

### Correctness: **False**
