### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies several critical issues with the provided program. Let's break down the reasoning to ensure that the original assessment is accurate:

1. **Initialization of `l` and `r`**:
   - The program initializes `l` and `r` correctly as `0` and `n` respectively, which aligns with the binary search algorithm described in the problem.

2. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - The loop correctly implements the binary search algorithm, updating `l` and `r` based on the value of `array[mid]`. This part of the program is correct.

3. **Checking the Result**:
   - After the loop, the program checks if `l` is the index of `x` in the array. If not, it suggests a swap to move `x` to the `l` position. This logic is also correct in terms of identifying when a swap is needed.

4. **Issues in the Program**:
   - The program only considers a single swap if `l` is not the index of `x`. However, the problem guarantees that at most 2 swaps are sufficient, and the program does not attempt to use the second swap if the first swap is insufficient. This is a significant issue because the program may not correctly rearrange the array in all cases.
   - The program does not handle cases where more than one swap is needed to ensure that the binary search will correctly identify `x`. This is a critical flaw since the problem statement explicitly mentions that two swaps are always sufficient.
   - The output format is another issue. The function `func_1` is supposed to return the number of swaps and the indices of the swaps, but the current implementation prints the number of swaps and the indices directly, which is not consistent with the problem's requirement to return these values.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct output for all cases. Specifically, it does not handle cases where more than one swap is needed and does not correctly format the output as required by the problem statement.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
