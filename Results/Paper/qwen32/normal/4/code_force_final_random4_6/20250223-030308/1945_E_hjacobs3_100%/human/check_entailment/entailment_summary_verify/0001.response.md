### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the program meets the requirements of the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to rearrange a permutation `p` of length `n` such that after performing at most 2 swaps, a binary search algorithm will correctly identify the index `l` where `p[l]` equals `x`.
- The binary search algorithm updates `l` and `r` based on the value of `array[mid]`.
- The goal is to ensure that after the binary search, `p[l]` is equal to `x`.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program consists of a main loop that processes multiple test cases and a function `func_1` that handles the logic for each test case.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes `l` and `r` correctly as `0` and `n` respectively.

2. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - The loop correctly implements the binary search algorithm, updating `l` and `r` based on the value of `array[mid]`.

3. **Checking the Result**:
   - After the loop, the program checks if `l` is the index of `x` in the array.
   - If `l` is not the index of `x`, the program prints `1` and suggests a swap to move `x` to the `l` position.
   - If `l` is already the index of `x`, the program prints `0`.

#### Issues in the Program:
- **Single Swap Limitation**:
  - The program only considers a single swap if `l` is not the index of `x`. However, the problem guarantees that at most 2 swaps are sufficient, and the program does not attempt to use the second swap if the first swap is insufficient.
  - For example, if the first swap does not place `x` at the correct position, the program does not try a second swap to correct the situation.

- **Output Format**:
  - The function `func_1` is supposed to return the number of swaps and the indices of the swaps, but the current implementation prints the number of swaps and the indices directly, which is not consistent with the problem's requirement to return these values.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function takes an array and an integer `find` and returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the value of `l + 1`, where `l` is the largest index such that `array[l] <= find`, and the second string is the value of the index of `find` in `array` plus 1.
- If `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in `array`, it prints `1`; otherwise, it prints `0`.

#### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not guarantee to produce the correct output for all cases. Specifically, it does not handle cases where more than one swap is needed and does not correctly format the output as required by the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle all cases and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Final: **False**
