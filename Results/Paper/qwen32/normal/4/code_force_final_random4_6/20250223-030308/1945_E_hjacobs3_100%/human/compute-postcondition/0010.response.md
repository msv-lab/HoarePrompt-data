The code snippet calculates the midpoint `mid` between `l` and `r` using integer division. The values of `array`, `find`, `n`, `l`, and `r` are not affected by this calculation, but `mid` is newly assigned a value.

Output State: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is the length of the array; `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`; `n` must be greater than 1; `r` must be at least `l + 2`; `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`.**
