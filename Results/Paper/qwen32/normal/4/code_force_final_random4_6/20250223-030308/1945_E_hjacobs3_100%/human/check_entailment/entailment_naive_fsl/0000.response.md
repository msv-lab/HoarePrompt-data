Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 

Let's analyze the provided program and see if it meets all the requirements of the problem description.

The program is supposed to perform up to two swaps on a permutation array to ensure that after performing a binary search, the element at the position `l` is equal to `x`.

Here's the problematic part of the code:

```python
if l != array.index(find):
    print(1)
    return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
else:
    print(0)
```

The code checks if the current `l` is not the index of the element `x` in the array and if so, it performs a single swap. However, this approach does not guarantee that after performing the swap, the binary search will end with `p_l` equal to `x`. The binary search algorithm expects the array to be sorted for it to work correctly, and a single swap may not be sufficient to sort the array or position `x` correctly.

Let's consider a test case to demonstrate the issue:

**Test Case:**
```
1
5 3
5 4 3 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
1 3
4 5
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- The array is not sorted, and a single swap is not enough to make the binary search work correctly.
- By swapping elements at positions 1 and 3, the array becomes `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`.
- By swapping elements at positions 4 and 5, the array becomes `[3, 4, 5, 2, 1]`.
- Now, performing binary search on this array will correctly find `3` at position `l`.

However, the provided code will only perform one swap and will not handle this case correctly. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem requirements for all potential cases.

Thus, the correctness of the program is **False**.
