Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `array`, which is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and `find`, which is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n. The function returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the value of `l + 1` (where `l` is not explicitly defined in the problem statement, so it is assumed to be an index or position related to `array`), and the second string is the value of the index of `find` in `array` plus 1.**
