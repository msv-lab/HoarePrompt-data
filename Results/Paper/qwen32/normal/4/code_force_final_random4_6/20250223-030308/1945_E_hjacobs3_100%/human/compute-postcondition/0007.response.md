The value of `r` is updated to be equal to `mid`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is the length of the array, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `(l + r) // 2`, `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`, and `array[mid]` is greater than `find`.**
