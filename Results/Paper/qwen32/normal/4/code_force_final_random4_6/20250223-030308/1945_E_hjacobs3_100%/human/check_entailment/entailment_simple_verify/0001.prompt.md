You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to rearrange a permutation `p` of length `n` such that after performing at most 2 swaps, a binary search algorithm will correctly identify the index `l` where `p[l]` equals `x`. The binary search algorithm is described in the problem statement, and it relies on the fact that `l` should point to `x` at the end of the algorithm.

### Program Analysis
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution. Here's a detailed breakdown of why:

1. **Initialization of `l` and `r`**:
   - The program initializes `l` and `r` as `0` and `n` respectively, which is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - The loop correctly implements the binary search algorithm, updating `l` and `r` based on the value of `array[mid]`.

3. **Checking the Result**:
   - After the loop, the program checks if `l` is the index of `x` in the array.
   - If `l` is not the index of `x`, the program prints `1` and suggests a swap to move `x` to the `l` position.
   - If `l` is already the index of `x`, the program prints `0`.

### Issues in the Program
- **Incorrect Swap Logic**:
  - The program only considers a single swap if `l` is not the index of `x`. However, the problem guarantees that at most 2 swaps are sufficient, and the program does not attempt to use the second swap if the first swap is insufficient.
  - The program does not handle cases where more than one swap is needed to ensure that the binary search will correctly identify `x`.

- **Output Format**:
  - The function `func_1` is supposed to return the number of swaps and the indices of the swaps, but the current implementation prints the number of swaps and the indices directly, which is not consistent with the problem's requirement to return these values.

### Correctness
Given the issues mentioned above, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct output for all cases. Specifically, it does not handle cases where more than one swap is needed and does not correctly format the output as required by the problem statement.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
