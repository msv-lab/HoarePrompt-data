The code snippet `kq2 = kq2 + str(y)` appends the string representation of `y` to the variable `kq2`. The other variables `i`, `x`, `y`, `vt`, and `kq1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`; `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`; `vt` is 1; `kq1` is `kq1` + `str(x)`; `kq2` is `kq2` + `str(y)`**.

In human-readable terms: The value of `kq2` is now the original `kq2` concatenated with the string representation of `y`. All other variables retain their previous values.
