The code snippet `kq2 = kq2 + str(y)` concatenates the string representation of `y` to the existing value of `kq2`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`; `t` is greater than 0; `a` is the value of the user input and has a length greater than 0; `b` is the value of the user input; `i` is 2; `vt` is 1; `kq1` is the previous value of `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `x`; `kq2` is the previous value of `kq2` concatenated with the string representation of `y`.**
