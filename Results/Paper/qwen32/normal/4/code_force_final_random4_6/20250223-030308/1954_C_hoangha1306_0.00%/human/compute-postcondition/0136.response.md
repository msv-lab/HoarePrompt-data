Postcondition: **`kq1` is '', `kq2` is '', `vt` is 1, `a` is a sequence with at least one element, `b` is the user input, `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, and `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`. The current value of `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and the current value of `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`. `t` remains unchanged, and `q` is `q + 1`.**
