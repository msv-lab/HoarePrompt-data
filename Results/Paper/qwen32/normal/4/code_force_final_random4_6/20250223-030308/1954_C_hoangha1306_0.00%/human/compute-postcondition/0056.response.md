Postcondition: **`x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`; `t` is greater than 0; `a` is the value of the user input and has a length greater than 0; `b` is the value of the user input; `i` is 2. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is its original value concatenated with `str(y)` and `kq2` is its original value concatenated with `str(x)`. If `vt` is not 0, `vt` is 1, and if `a[i] > b[i]`, `kq1` is the previous value of `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is the previous value of `kq2` concatenated with the string representation of `y`. Otherwise, `kq1` is `kq1 + str(y)`, and `kq2` is `kq2 + str(x)`.**
