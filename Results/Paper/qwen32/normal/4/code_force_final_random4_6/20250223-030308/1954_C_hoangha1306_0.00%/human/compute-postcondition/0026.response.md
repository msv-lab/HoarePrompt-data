Postcondition: **`x` and `y` are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and they have the same length; `t` is greater than 0; `a` is the value of the user input and has a length greater than 0; `b` is the value of the user input; `i` is 0. If `vt` was originally 0, then `kq1` is the string representation of the minimum of the `i`th element of `a` and `b` converted to an integer, `kq2` is the string representation of the maximum of the `i`th element of `a` and `b` converted to an integer, and `vt` is set to 1. If `vt` was not 0, then `kq1` is the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`. In both cases, `x` is the minimum of the `i`th element of `a` and `b` converted to integers, and `y` is the maximum of the `i`th element of `a` and `b` converted to integers.**
