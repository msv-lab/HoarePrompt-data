Postcondition: **`x` and `y` are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and they have the same length; `t` is greater than 0; `a` is the value of the user input and has a length greater than 0; `b` is the value of the user input; `kq1` is the string representation of the minimum of the `i`th element of `a` and `b` converted to an integer; `kq2` is the string representation of the maximum of the `i`th element of `a` and `b` converted to an integer; `vt` is 1; `i` is 0. If the `i`th element of `a` is greater than the `i`th element of `b`, then `x` is the value of the `i`th element of `b` converted to an integer and `y` is the value of the `i`th element of `a` converted to an integer. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the `i`th element of `a` and `b` converted to integers and `y` is the maximum of the `i`th element of `a` and `b` converted to integers.**
