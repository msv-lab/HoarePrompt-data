Postcondition: **`kq1` and `kq2` are updated based on the comparison between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, `kq1` is the previous value of `kq1` concatenated with `a[i]`, and `kq2` is `a[i]`. If `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are set to the string representations of `y` and `x` respectively if `vt` was initially 0 and `a[i]` is less than `b[i]`, or `x` and `y` respectively if `vt` was initially 0 and `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`. If `vt` was not 0, `kq1` and `kq2` are set to the string representations of `y` and `x` respectively. `vt` is 1 if it was initially 0 and `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]`, and remains unchanged otherwise. `x` and `y` are updated to the minimum and maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])` respectively if `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]`, and remain unchanged otherwise. `t` remains unchanged, `q` is `q + 1`, `a` is a sequence with at least one element, and `b` is the user input.**
