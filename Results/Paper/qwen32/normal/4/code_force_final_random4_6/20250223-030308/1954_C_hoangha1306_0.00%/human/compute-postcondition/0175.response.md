The code snippet `kq2 = kq2 + str(x)` appends the string representation of `x` to the variable `kq2`. The other variables `i`, `x`, `y`, and `kq1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`; `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`; `kq1` is `kq1` + `str(y)`; `kq2` is `kq2` + `str(x)`**.
