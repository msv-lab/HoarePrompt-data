Postcondition: **`a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `t` remains unchanged, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `vt` is 1. If `a[i] > b[i]`, `kq1` is the original `kq1` with the string representation of `x` appended to it, and `kq2` is the original `kq2` with the string representation of `y` appended to it. Otherwise, `kq1` is its previous value concatenated with `str(y)`, and `kq2` is its previous value concatenated with `str(x)`**
