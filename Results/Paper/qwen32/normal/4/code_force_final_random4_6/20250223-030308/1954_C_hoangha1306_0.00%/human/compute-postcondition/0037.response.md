The code snippet `kq2 = kq2 + str(x)` appends the string representation of `x` to the existing value of `kq2`. 

Given the initial state, `kq2` is not explicitly defined, so it must have been defined previously in a way that it can be concatenated with a string. For the sake of this exercise, we will assume that `kq2` was an empty string or a string that can be concatenated with another string.

The other variables remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`x` is the minimum of the first digit of `a` and the first digit of `b`; `y` is the maximum of the first digit of `a` and the first digit of `b`; `t` is greater than 0; `a` is the value of the user input and has a length greater than 0; `b` is the value of the user input; `i` is 1; `vt` is 1; `kq1` is the string representation of `y`; `kq2` is the previous value of `kq2` concatenated with the string representation of `x`.**
