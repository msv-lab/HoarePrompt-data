The code snippet `kq1 = kq1 + str(y)` concatenates the string representation of `y` to the existing string `kq1`. The values of other variables remain unchanged as per the given initial state.

Output State: **`a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `t` remains unchanged, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `vt` is 1, `kq1` is the original `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `y`.**
