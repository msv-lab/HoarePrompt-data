To determine what will be printed by the `print(kq2)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state provided.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **kq1 and kq2**: These variables are constructed based on the comparison of `a` and `b`. However, the exact construction method is not specified.
2. **vt**: This variable is 1 if there was any mismatch between `a` and `b`, otherwise 0.
3. **x and y**: These variables represent the last minimum and maximum values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` that were different.

### Key Points:
- The value of `kq2` is not explicitly defined in terms of a formula or a direct value in the initial state.
- The only information we have about `kq2` is that it is constructed based on the comparison of `a` and `b`.

Given the limited information, we can only describe `kq2` in terms of how it is constructed. Since the exact construction method is not provided, we cannot determine its numerical value. However, we can describe its relationship to `a` and `b`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(kq2)` statement will output the value of `kq2`, which is constructed based on the comparison of `a` and `b`.

Output: **kq2 (where kq2 is constructed based on the comparison of a and b)**
