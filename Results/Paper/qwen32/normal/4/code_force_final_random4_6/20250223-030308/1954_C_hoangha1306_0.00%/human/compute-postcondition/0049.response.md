The code snippet provided is `kq1 = kq1 + str(x)`. This line of code implies that `kq1` is a string, and `x` is being converted to a string and concatenated to `kq1`. 

Given the initial state, `x` is already defined as the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`. The other variables (`y`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `vt`) are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State will be:
Output State: **`x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`; `t` is greater than 0; `a` is the value of the user input and has a length greater than 0; `b` is the value of the user input; `i` is 2; `vt` is 1; `kq1` is the previous value of `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `x`.**
