Postcondition: **`i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are each increased by `a[i]`. Otherwise, `x` is set to the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `y` is set to the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If `vt` was originally 0, `vt` is set to 1, `kq1` is concatenated with `str(x)` if `a[i] <= b[i]`, otherwise `kq1` is concatenated with `str(y)`, and `kq2` is concatenated with `str(y)` if `a[i] <= b[i]`, otherwise `kq2` is concatenated with `str(x)`. If `vt` was not 0, `kq1` is concatenated with `str(y)` and `kq2` is concatenated with `str(x)`**.
