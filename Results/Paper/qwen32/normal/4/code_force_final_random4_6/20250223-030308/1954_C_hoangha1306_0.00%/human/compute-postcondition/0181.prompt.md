Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` and `y` are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and they have the same length; `t` is the input integer.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    a = input()
    b = input()
    kq1 = ''
    kq2 = ''
    vt = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
            kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
            continue
        else:
            x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
            if vt == 0:
                vt = 1
                if a[i] > b[i]:
                    kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                    kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
                else:
                    kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                    kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
    print(kq1)
    print(kq2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `kq1` and `kq2` are strings built based on the comparison of `a` and `b` as described, `vt` is 1 if there was at least one mismatch, otherwise 0, `x` and `y` are the minimum and maximum of the last compared characters, `t` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `kq1` is the constructed string based on the rules, `kq2` is the constructed string based on the rules, `vt` is 1 if there was at least one differing character, otherwise 0, `x` and `y` are the last compared minimum and maximum values, `t` remains unchanged, `q` is the length of the string `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: kq1 and kq2 are constructed based on the comparison of a and b, vt is 1 if there was any mismatch, otherwise 0, and x and y are the last minimum and maximum values of a[i] and b[i] that were different.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
