The code snippet `kq1 = kq1 + str(y)` concatenates the string representation of `y` to the current value of `kq1`. Given the initial state, `kq1` was an empty string, so after this operation, `kq1` will hold the string representation of `y`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Here is the output state:

Output State: **`kq1` is the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is '', `vt` is not equal to 0, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `t` remains unchanged, `q` is `q + 1`, `a` is a sequence with at least one element, `b` is the user input, and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`.**
