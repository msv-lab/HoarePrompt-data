Let's analyze the given initial state and the `print` statement step-by-step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Input Variables:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). This variable `t` is mentioned to indicate the number of test cases, but it does not directly affect the `print` statement in question.
   - `n`: An integer read from the input.
   - `k`: An integer read from the input.
   - `l`: A list of integers read from the input.
   
2. **Derived Variables:**
   - `p`: A list where each element is the count of a unique integer from the list `l`. This is created using a list comprehension: `p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]`.
   - `i`: Incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`), but this variable is not used in the `print` statement.

### Print Statement:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(k - 1)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `k` is an integer read from the input. The `print` statement will output the result of the expression `k - 1`.
- Since the exact value of `k` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot provide a numerical value for the output. However, we know that the output will be the value of `k` minus 1.

### Output:
Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be `k - 1`.

Output: **k - 1 (where k is the integer read from the input)**
