Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` and `k` are new integers read from the input; `l` is a new list of integers read from the input; `p` is a list where each element is the count of a unique integer from the previous `l`, specifically `p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]`; `i` is `i + 1`. If the maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, the if block executes; otherwise, the else block executes. In both cases, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `p`, and `i` are as described.**

Since both the if and else parts have the same postconditions, the overall postcondition remains consistent regardless of which branch is taken.
