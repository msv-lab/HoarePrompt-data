Let's break down the given initial state and the provided code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). 
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
- `l` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `p` is a list where each element is the count of a unique integer from `l`, specifically `p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]`.
- `i` is incremented by 1, but `i` is not used in the provided print statement.

### Code Snippet
```python
print(k - 1)
```

### Analysis
The print statement `print(k - 1)` will output the result of the expression `k - 1`. From the initial state, we know that `k` is an integer read from the input. The value of `k` is not explicitly provided, so we can only describe the output in terms of `k`.

### Output
The output of the print statement will be the value of `k` minus 1.

Output: **k - 1 (where k is an integer read from the input)**
