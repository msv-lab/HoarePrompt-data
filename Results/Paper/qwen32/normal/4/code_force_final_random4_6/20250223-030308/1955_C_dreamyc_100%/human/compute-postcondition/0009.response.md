The given code snippet modifies the variable `s_b` by adding the value of `nums[n - i - 1]` to it. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `nums`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, and `s_a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `n` is at least 1, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Additionally, `k` is less than the sum of `nums`. `a` is the ceiling of `k / 2`, and `b` is the floor of `k / 2`. `ans` is 0. `s_a` is `nums[i]`. `s_b` is `s_b + nums[n - i - 1]`.**
