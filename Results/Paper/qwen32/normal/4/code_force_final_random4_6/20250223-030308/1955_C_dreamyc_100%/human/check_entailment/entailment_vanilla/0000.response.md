Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The task involves determining how many ships are sunk after the Kraken attacks them `k` times, alternating between the first and last ship. Each attack reduces the durability of the targeted ship by 1. A ship sinks when its durability drops to 0. The Kraken stops attacking once all ships have sunk.

### Program Analysis

The provided program is as follows:

```python
from collections import deque
import math

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ans = func_1(n, k, nums)
    print(ans)

def func_1(n, k, nums):
    if k >= sum(nums):
        return n
    (a, b) = (math.ceil(k / 2), k // 2)
    ans = 0
    s_a = 0
    s_b = 0
    for i in range(n):
        s_a += nums[i]
        s_b += nums[n - i - 1]
        if s_a <= a:
            ans += 1
        if s_b <= b:
            ans += 1
    return ans
```

#### Key Points of the Program

1. **Base Case Handling**:
   - If the total number of attacks `k` is greater than or equal to the total durability of all ships `sum(nums)`, then all ships will sink. This is correctly handled by the line `if k >= sum(nums): return n`.

2. **Attack Distribution**:
   - The Kraken attacks the first ship `math.ceil(k / 2)` times and the last ship `k // 2` times. This is correctly calculated by `(a, b) = (math.ceil(k / 2), k // 2)`.

3. **Counting Sunk Ships**:
   - The program iterates through the list of ship durabilities from both ends (first to last and last to first simultaneously).
   - It maintains two cumulative sums, `s_a` and `s_b`, representing the total durability encountered from the start and end, respectively.
   - For each ship, it checks if the cumulative durability from the start (`s_a`) is less than or equal to the number of attacks on the first ship (`a`). If true, it increments the count of sunk ships.
   - Similarly, it checks if the cumulative durability from the end (`s_b`) is less than or equal to the number of attacks on the last ship (`b`). If true, it increments the count of sunk ships.

### Flaws in the Program

The main issue with the program lies in the logic for counting the sunk ships. The program does not correctly account for the fact that once a ship sinks, it is no longer considered for future attacks. The current approach simply checks if the cumulative durability is less than or equal to the number of attacks, which does not accurately reflect the sinking process.

For example, consider the case where `n=4`, `k=5`, and `a=[1, 2, 4, 3]`. The correct sequence of attacks would sink the first ship on the first attack, then the last ship on the second attack, then the first ship again on the third attack, and so on. The program's logic would incorrectly count ships as sunk even if they have already sunk.

### Correctness

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly determine the number of sunk ships. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
