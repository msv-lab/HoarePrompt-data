The code snippet `s_b += nums[n - i - 1]` increments the value of `s_b` by the value of `nums[n - i - 1]`. The initial state provided includes expressions for `i` and `s_a`, but these are not directly affected by the given code snippet. Therefore, the value of `i` remains `i + 1` and `s_a` remains `s_a + nums[i]`.

The only change is to `s_b`, which is incremented by `nums[n - i - 1]`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `s_a` is `s_a + nums[i]`; `s_b` is `s_b + nums[n - i - 1]`.**
