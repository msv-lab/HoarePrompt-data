### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine the number of ships that are sunk after the Kraken's attacks. The logic in the provided `func_1` function seems flawed. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues and the correct approach:

1. **Sum of Durabilities Check:**
   - The function correctly checks if `k` (the number of attacks) is greater than or equal to the sum of all ship durabilities. If true, all ships will be sunk, and the function returns `n`.

2. **Handling Attacks:**
   - The logic for handling the alternating attacks on the first and last ships is incorrect. The current implementation calculates `a` and `b` as the number of attacks on the first and last ships respectively, but it does not correctly simulate the alternating attacks and the sinking of ships.
   - The variables `s_a` and `s_b` accumulate the total durability of ships attacked from the first and last ends, respectively. However, the logic to determine the number of sunk ships based on these accumulations is incorrect. The logic does not correctly account for the fact that once a ship's durability reaches zero, it is no longer attacked.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - A correct approach would involve simulating the alternating attacks while keeping track of the indices of ships that are still afloat. This could be done using a deque to efficiently remove the first and last elements.
   - Alternatively, a more efficient approach would be to calculate the number of attacks required to sink each ship from both ends and then determine how many ships can be sunk within `k` attacks.

### Correctness:

Given the flawed logic in the provided `func_1`, the program does not correctly determine the number of ships sunk after the Kraken's attacks. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**

### Suggested Correct Implementation:

Here's a suggested correct implementation for the `func_1` function:

```python
from collections import deque

def func_1(n, k, nums):
    if k >= sum(nums):
        return n
    
    ships = deque(nums)
    attacks = 0
    sunk = 0
    
    while k > 0 and ships:
        if attacks % 2 == 0:
            if ships[0] > 0:
                ships[0] -= 1
                if ships[0] == 0:
                    sunk += 1
                    ships.popleft()
            else:
                ships.popleft()
        else:
            if ships[-1] > 0:
                ships[-1] -= 1
                if ships[-1] == 0:
                    sunk += 1
                    ships.pop()
            else:
                ships.pop()
        attacks += 1
        k -= 1
    
    return sunk
```

This implementation correctly simulates the alternating attacks and keeps track of the number of ships that are sunk.
