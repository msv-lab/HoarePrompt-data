### Reasoning

Let's analyze the provided Python program and the function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap

The Kraken attacks ships in a specific order: first, the first ship, then the last, then the first again, and so on. Each attack reduces the durability of the ship by 1. A ship sinks when its durability drops to 0 and is no longer attacked. We need to determine how many ships will be sunk after `k` attacks.

#### Provided Code Analysis

The provided code uses the following approach:

1. It calculates `a` as `ceil(k / 2)` and `b` as `floor(k / 2)`, representing the number of attacks on the first and last ships, respectively.
2. It initializes cumulative sums `s_a` and `s_b` to track the total durability of ships attacked from the first and last sides, respectively.
3. It iterates through the list of ships, updating `s_a` and `s_b` and checking if these sums are less than or equal to `a` and `b`, respectively. If so, it increments the count of ships sunk.
4. The function returns the total count of ships sunk.

#### Issues in the Provided Code

1. **Incorrect Handling of Sunk Ships**: The code does not account for the fact that once a ship sinks, it is no longer part of the list of ships to be attacked. The cumulative sums `s_a` and `s_b` should only include the durability of ships that have not yet sunk.
2. **Incorrect Logic for Ship Sinking**: The code incorrectly assumes that the cumulative sums `s_a` and `s_b` can be directly compared to `a` and `b` to determine the number of ships sunk. It does not correctly simulate the order and effect of the Kraken's attacks.
3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle the case where the Kraken attacks more times than the total durability of all ships, which should result in all ships sinking.

#### Function Summary Analysis

The function summary correctly states that `func_1` calculates the number of ships sunk based on cumulative sums of elements from the start and end of the list `nums`. However, it does not address the issues with the logic of handling sunk ships and the order of attacks.

#### Conclusion

Given the issues identified in the code, particularly the incorrect handling of sunk ships and the order of attacks, the provided code does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attack pattern and does not accurately determine the number of ships sunk.

**Final: False**

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the provided code. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
