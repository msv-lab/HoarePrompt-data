#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and nums is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. It is also given that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    if (k >= sum(nums)) :
        return n
        #The program returns n, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Additionally, `k` is less than the sum of `nums`.
    a, b = math.ceil(k / 2), k // 2
    ans = 0
    s_a = 0
    s_b = 0
    for i in range(n):
        s_a += nums[i]
        
        s_b += nums[n - i - 1]
        
        if s_a <= a:
            ans += 1
        
        if s_b <= b:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: ans
    return ans
    #The program returns the value of variable 'ans'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of elements in the list `nums`; `k`, an integer; and `nums`, a list of `n` integers. If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in `nums`, the function returns `n`. Otherwise, it calculates a value `ans` based on the cumulative sums of elements from the start and end of the list `nums` and returns `ans`.
