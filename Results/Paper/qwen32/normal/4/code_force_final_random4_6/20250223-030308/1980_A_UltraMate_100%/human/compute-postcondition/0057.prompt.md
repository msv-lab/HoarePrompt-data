Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is `t - 1` and still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is the new input string, `p` is `'ABCDEFG'`, `hmp` is a Counter object containing the counts of each character in the new `s`, `ans` is `7 * m`.
Code of the loop:
for i in hmp:
    if hmp[i] < m:
        ans += m - hmp[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is `t - 1` and still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is the new input string that must contain at least one character, `p` is `'ABCDEFG'`, `hmp` is a Counter object containing the counts of each character in the new `s`. If there exists at least one character `i` in `hmp` such that the count of `i` is less than `m`, then `ans` is `7 * m + m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `7 * m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `t - 1` and still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is the new input string that must contain at least one character, `p` is `'ABCDEFG'`, `hmp` is a Counter object containing the counts of each character in the new `s`. `i` is the next key in `hmp` that hasn't been iterated over yet. If there exists at least one character `i` in `hmp` such that the count of `i` is less than `m`, then `ans` is `7 * m + 2 * m - 2 * hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `7 * m + m - hmp[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `t - 1` and still greater than 0; `n` is the first integer from the new input; `m` is the second integer from the new input; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'; `s` is the new input string that must contain at least one character; `p` is `'ABCDEFG'`; `hmp` is a Counter object containing the counts of each character in the new `s`; `i` is the next key in `hmp` that hasn't been iterated over yet. If `hmp[i] < m`, then `ans` is updated to its previous value plus `m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
