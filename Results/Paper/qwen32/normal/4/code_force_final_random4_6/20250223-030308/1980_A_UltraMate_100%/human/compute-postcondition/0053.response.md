Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1` and still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is the new input string that must contain at least one character, `p` is `'ABCDEFG'`, `hmp` is a Counter object containing the counts of each character in the new `s`. `i` is the next key in `hmp` that hasn't been iterated over yet. If there exists at least one character `i` in `hmp` such that the count of `i` is less than `m`, then `ans` is `7 * m + 2 * m - 2 * hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `7 * m + m - hmp[i]`.**

Note: The else part is not specified, so the postcondition only covers the case when `hmp[i] < m`.
