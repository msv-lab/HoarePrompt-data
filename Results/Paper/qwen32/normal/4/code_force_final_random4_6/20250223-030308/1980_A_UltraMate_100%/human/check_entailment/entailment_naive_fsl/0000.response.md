Let's analyze the provided program and see if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure he has enough problems of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') for `m` rounds. Each round requires one problem of each difficulty level.

### Provided Program
```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        ans = 0
        p = 'ABCDEFG'
        hmp = Counter(s)
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
        for i in hmp:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Review

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of problems) and `m` (number of rounds).
   - It reads the string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Counting Problems:**
   - It uses `Counter` to count occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed:**
   - For each difficulty level in 'ABCDEFG':
     - If the difficulty level is not present in the `Counter` (`hmp`), it adds `m` to the answer because all `m` rounds need a problem of that level.
     - If the difficulty level is present but the count is less than `m`, it adds the difference (`m - hmp[i]`) to the answer.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, it prints the total number of additional problems needed.

### Checking for Correctness
- The program correctly handles the case where a difficulty level is completely missing by adding `m` to the answer.
- It also correctly handles the case where a difficulty level is present but insufficient by adding the difference.
- The program iterates over all required difficulty levels ('ABCDEFG') and checks the counts appropriately.

### Edge Cases
- **All Difficulty Levels Present and Sufficient:**
  - If `s` contains at least `m` problems of each difficulty level, the answer should be `0`.
- **All Difficulty Levels Missing:**
  - If `s` is empty or does not contain any of the required difficulty levels, the answer should be `7 * m` (since there are 7 difficulty levels).
- **Mixed Cases:**
  - If `s` contains some but not all required difficulty levels, or if some levels are present but insufficient, the program should correctly compute the additional problems needed.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the program, it seems to handle all potential cases correctly as per the problem description. There are no apparent issues or edge cases that the program fails to address.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**

### Explanation
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case by ensuring that each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') is represented at least `m` times. It handles all edge cases, including when all levels are present, when all are missing, and when there are mixed cases.
