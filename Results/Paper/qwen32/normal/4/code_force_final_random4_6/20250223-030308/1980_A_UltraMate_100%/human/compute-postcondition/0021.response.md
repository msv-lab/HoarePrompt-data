Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is a non-empty string from the input, `p` is `'ABCDEFG'`, `hmp` is a Counter object containing the counts of each character in `s`. If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, then `ans` is `k * m + (m - hmp[i])` where `k` is the number of characters in `'ABCDEFG'` not present in `hmp`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `k * m`.**
