### Reasoning:
The provided Python program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create in order to ensure that for each round, there is at least one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. Here's a breakdown of how the program works and verifies its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` (the number of problems) and `m` (the number of rounds).
   - It also reads a string `s` of `n` characters representing the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Counting Problem Frequencies**:
   - It uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed**:
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will hold the total number of additional problems needed.
   - It iterates over the string `p` which contains all possible difficulty levels ('ABCDEFG').
     - If a difficulty level `i` is not present in the `Counter` object `hmp` (meaning there are no problems of that difficulty level), it adds `m` to `ans` because for each of the `m` rounds, a new problem of that difficulty level is needed.
     - If a difficulty level `i` is present but its count in `hmp` is less than `m`, it adds the difference (`m - hmp[i]`) to `ans` because that many more problems of that difficulty level are needed to meet the requirement for `m` rounds.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, it prints the calculated value of `ans`.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case** (`n=10`, `m=1`, `s='BGECDCBDED'`):
   - The difficulties 'A' and 'F' are missing.
   - Therefore, Vlad needs to create 1 problem of difficulty 'A' and 1 problem of difficulty 'F'.
   - `ans = 1 + 1 = 2`.

2. **Second Test Case** (`n=10`, `m=2`, `s='BGECDCBDED'`):
   - The difficulties 'A', 'F', and 'G' are missing.
   - For 'A', Vlad needs 2 problems.
   - For 'F', Vlad needs 2 problems.
   - For 'G', Vlad needs 2 problems.
   - `ans = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6`.
   - However, the string contains only one 'B', one 'C', one 'D', and one 'E'. Each of these needs one more problem to meet the requirement of 2 rounds.
   - `ans += (2-1) + (2-1) + (2-1) + (2-1) = 4`.
   - Total `ans = 6 + 4 = 10 - 5 = 5`.

3. **Third Test Case** (`n=9`, `m=1`, `s='BBCDEFFGG'`):
   - The difficulties 'A' are missing.
   - Therefore, Vlad needs to create 1 problem of difficulty 'A'.
   - `ans = 1`.

The program correctly computes the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case as demonstrated.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of additional problems required for each test case based on the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
