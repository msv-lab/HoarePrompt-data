Postcondition: **`s` is the new input string that must contain at least one character, `hmp` is a Counter object containing the counts of each character in `s` with at least one character having a count greater than zero, `i` is the next key in `hmp`. If `hmp[i] < m`, then `ans` is updated to `ans + m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
