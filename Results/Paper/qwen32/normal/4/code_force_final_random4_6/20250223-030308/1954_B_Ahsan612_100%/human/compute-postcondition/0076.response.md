Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers \([a1, a2, ..., an]\)
- `i` is set to `n`
- `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `ar[n-1]` at the end of the list
- `num` is set to `ar[n-1]`
- `minn` is initially set to either `inf` or `minn` is equal to the length of `ar`
- `minn` is then updated to be the minimum of its original value and `same`

### Print Statement:
```python
print(-1)
```

### Analysis:
The print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `same`, `num`, or `minn`. The print statement simply outputs the integer `-1`.

### Output:
Output: **-1**
