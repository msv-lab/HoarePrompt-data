The code snippet `num = ar[i]` assigns the value of `ar[i]` to the variable `num`. According to the initial state, the value of `i` is either 3 or 4. If `i` is 3, then `ar[i]` is `num`. If `i` is 4, then `ar[i]` is not `num` but `ar[2]`.

Given the initial conditions:
- If `i` is 3, `num` is already `ar[3]` (which is `num` itself).
- If `i` is 4, `num` is updated to `ar[4]`.

Since `i` is either 3 or 4, after the code executes, `num` will be `ar[3]` if `i` was 3, or `ar[4]` if `i` was 4.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer and `n` must be greater than 3; `ar` is a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]` with `n > 1`. If `i` is 3, `same` is 2, and `minn` is `inf`. Otherwise, `i` is 4, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[4]`, and `minn` is 1. `num` is `ar[i]`.**
