The code snippet `num = ar[i]` assigns the value of `ar[i]` to the variable `num`. Given the initial state, `i` is 6. Therefore, `num` will be assigned the value of `ar[6]`.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `t` is still an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is still the input integer and `n` must be at least 6.
- `ar` is still a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]` with `n > 1`.
- `same` is still 1.
- `minn` is still 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer and `n` must be at least 6; `ar` is a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]` with `n > 1`; `i` is 6; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[6]`; `minn` is 1.**
