The code snippet assigns the value of `ar[i]` to the variable `num`. Given the initial state, `i` is increased by 1 and is still less than `len(ar)`, which means `i` is a valid index for the list `ar`. Therefore, `num` will take on the value of the element at index `i` in the list `ar`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 3; `i` is increased by 1, and `i` is still less than `len(ar)`; `num` is `ar[i]`.**
