The code snippet provided is `same = 1`. This line of code reassigns the value of the variable `same` to 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `num`, `minn`) are not affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]` with `n > 1`; `i` is 2; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[2]`; `minn` is 1**
