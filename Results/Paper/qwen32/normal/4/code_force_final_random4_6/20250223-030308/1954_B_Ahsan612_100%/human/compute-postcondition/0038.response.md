To determine the output of the `print(minn)` statement, we need to understand the context and state of the variables provided in the initial state description.

1. **Variables and Their Definitions:**
   - `t`: An integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (This value is not directly used in the provided code snippet, so it can be ignored for this specific print statement).
   - `n`: An input integer.
   - `ar`: A list of integers.
   - `i`: The length of the list `ar`.
   - `same`: The count of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are equal.
   - `num`: The value of the last element in the list `ar` or the value of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are equal.
   - `minn`: The minimum count of any sequence of consecutive elements that are equal encountered during the loop, and `minn` is neither infinity nor equal to the length of `ar`.

2. **Logic of the Code:**
   - The variable `minn` is described as the minimum count of any sequence of consecutive elements that are equal encountered during the loop.
   - This implies that there must be some loop in the code that iterates over the list `ar` and counts sequences of consecutive elements that are equal, updating `minn` to the smallest count of such sequences found.

3. **Determining the Output:**
   - The value of `minn` is the minimum count of any sequence of consecutive elements that are equal in the list `ar`.
   - Since we don't have the exact values of `ar`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `minn`.
   - However, we can describe `minn` as the minimum count of consecutive equal elements in the list `ar`.

Given the above understanding, the `print(minn)` statement will output the minimum count of consecutive equal elements in the list `ar`.

Output: **minn (where minn is the minimum count of consecutive equal elements in the list `ar`)**
