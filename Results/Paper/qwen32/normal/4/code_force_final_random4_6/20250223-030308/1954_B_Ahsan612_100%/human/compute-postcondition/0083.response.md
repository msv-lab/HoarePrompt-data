Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 (after decrementing by 1); `ar` is a new list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]` read from the input; `n` is the length of the new `ar` list; `i`, `num`, and `minn` are undefined or recalculated based on the new `ar` list; `same` is 1.**

This means that the value of `same` has been set to 1, while the other variables remain in their initial state or are undefined as per the provided code snippet.
