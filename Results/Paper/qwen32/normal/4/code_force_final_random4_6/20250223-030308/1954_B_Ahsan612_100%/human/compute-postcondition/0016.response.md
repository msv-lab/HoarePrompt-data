The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` now equals 3. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `same`, and `minn`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 1; `i` is 3. If `ar[i-1]` equals `num`, then `same` is 2; otherwise, `same` is 1 and `num` is updated to `ar[i]`. `minn` is 1 if `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, otherwise `minn` remains `inf`.**
