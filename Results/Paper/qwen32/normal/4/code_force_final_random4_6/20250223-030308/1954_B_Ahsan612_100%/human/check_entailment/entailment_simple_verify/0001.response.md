### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be transformed into an array of identical elements using a specific operation. If it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements, we should return `-1`.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve this problem by identifying the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive identical elements in the array. The logic is as follows:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `same` is initialized to 1 to count the length of the current sequence of identical elements.
   - `num` is set to the first element of the array.
   - `minn` is set to infinity to track the minimum length of any sequence of identical elements.
2. **Loop through the array**:
   - If the current element is the same as `num`, it increments `same`.
   - If the current element is different from `num`, it updates `minn` with the minimum value between `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and updates `num` to the current element.
3. **Final update**:
   - After the loop, `minn` is updated one last time with the minimum value between `minn` and `same`.
4. **Determine the result**:
   - If `minn` is still infinity (which shouldn't happen as it's initialized to `same` at least once) or if `minn` is equal to the length of the array (meaning all elements are the same), the program outputs `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it outputs `minn`.

#### Issues with the Program:
The core issue with the program is that it only considers the minimum length of any sequence of identical elements, which is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The program fails to consider the overall structure of the array and how removing elements can affect the ability to perform the specified operation.

For example, consider the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`:
- The program will identify the sequence `[3, 3, 3]` at the beginning and at the end, both of length 3.
- It will also identify the sequence `[5]` of length 1.
- The minimum sequence length will be 1, but removing just one element (the `5`) does not make the array non-beautiful because the remaining array `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]` is still beautiful.
- To make the array non-beautiful, we need to remove at least 3 elements (e.g., the first three `3`s or the last three `3`s).

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the structure of the array and how removing elements affects the ability to perform the specified operation. A more appropriate approach would involve identifying the longest sequence of identical elements that can be transformed into a single element and then determining the minimum number of elements to remove to disrupt this transformation.

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
