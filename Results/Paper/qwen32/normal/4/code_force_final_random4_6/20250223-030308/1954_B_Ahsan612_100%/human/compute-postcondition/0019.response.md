Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 3; `i` is 4**.

Explanation: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `ar`) remain unchanged.
