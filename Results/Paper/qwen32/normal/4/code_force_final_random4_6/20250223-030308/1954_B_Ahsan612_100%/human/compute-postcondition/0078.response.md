To determine the output of the `print(minn)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the relevant variables step by step.

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable is not directly used in the code snippet provided, so we can ignore it for this task.
   - `n` is the input integer, representing the length of the list `ar`.
   - `ar` is a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]`.
   - `i` is set to `n`.
   - `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `ar[n-1]` at the end of the list `ar`.
   - `num` is `ar[n-1]`, the last element of the list `ar`.
   - `minn` is the minimum of its original value and `same`. However, the original value of `minn` is not specified, so we assume it is initially set to a value that is neither `inf` nor the length of `ar`.

2. **Computing `same`:**
   - `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `ar[n-1]` at the end of the list `ar`. This means `same` counts how many times the last element of `ar` appears consecutively from the end of the list.

3. **Computing `minn`:**
   - `minn` is updated to be the minimum of its original value and `same`. Since the original value of `minn` is not given, we can only describe `minn` in terms of `same`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(minn)` statement will print the value of `minn`, which is the minimum of its original value and `same`.

Since the original value of `minn` is not specified, we can only describe the printed output in terms of `same`. However, we know that `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of the last element of `ar` at the end of the list.

Thus, the final output can be described as:
Output: **minn (where minn is the minimum of its original value and the count of consecutive occurrences of the last element of `ar` at the end of the list)**
