### Reasoning:

The given problem requires determining the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful. A beautiful array is defined as an array where you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

The provided code seems to attempt to solve this problem by finding the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive equal elements in the array. If all elements are the same (or there is only one element), it outputs `-1` because it's impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements. Otherwise, it outputs the length of the shortest sequence of consecutive equal elements, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to disrupt the beauty of the array.

Let's verify the logic with the given examples:

1. **Testcase 1:**
   - Input: `3 2 2 2`
   - The array is already uniform, so the minimum sequence length is 3, which equals the length of the array. Thus, the output is `-1`.
   
2. **Testcase 2:**
   - Input: `5 1 2 1 2 1`
   - The shortest sequence of consecutive equal elements is of length 1 (any single `1` or `2`). Removing one of these will make the array not beautiful. Thus, the output is `1`.
   
3. **Testcase 3:**
   - Input: `1 1`
   - The array is uniform, so the minimum sequence length is 1, which equals the length of the array. Thus, the output is `-1`.
   
4. **Testcase 4:**
   - Input: `7 3 3 3 5 3 3 3`
   - The shortest sequence of consecutive equal elements is of length 1 (the single `5`). Removing this `5` will make the array not beautiful. Thus, the output is `1`.
   - However, the provided code will find the shortest sequence of `3`s, which is of length 3, and output `3`.

The code correctly identifies the shortest sequence of consecutive equal elements, but the logic for outputting `-1` when all elements are the same is correct. However, the logic for the fourth test case is incorrect because it should output `1` instead of `3`.

### Conclusion:

The code logic is flawed for cases where a single element disrupts the uniformity, such as the fourth test case. Therefore, the code does not correctly solve the problem for all cases.

**Correctness: False**
