To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is only `i`.

The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`. At the end of the previous iteration, we have the following states:
- `i` is 3
- `n` is the input integer (which is the length of the list `ar`)
- `ar` is a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]` with `n > 1`
- Other variables like `same`, `num`, and `minn` are not relevant to the loop condition.

Since the loop condition is `i < len(ar)`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`. Given that `i` is currently 3, `len(ar)` must be greater than 3 to ensure that the loop can execute again.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `len(ar)` to be greater than 3. Since `n` is the length of `ar`, we need to ensure `n` is greater than 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer and `n` must be greater than 3; `ar` is a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]` with `n > 1`. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 2, `same` is 2, and `minn` is `inf`. Otherwise, `i` is 3, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[2]`, and `minn` is 1.**
