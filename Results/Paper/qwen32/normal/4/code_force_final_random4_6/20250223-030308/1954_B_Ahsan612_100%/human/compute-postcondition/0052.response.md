The code snippet `num = ar[i]` updates the value of `num` to be equal to the element at index `i` in the list `ar`. Given that `i` is 2, `num` will now hold the value of `ar[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]` with `n > 1`; `i` is 2; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[2]`; `minn` is `inf`; `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`**.

However, the last part of the initial state, `ar[i] is not equal to `num`, is contradictory because `num` is now equal to `ar[i]` after the execution of the code. Therefore, the correct output state should reflect this:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]` with `n > 1`; `i` is 2; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[2]`; `minn` is `inf`**.
