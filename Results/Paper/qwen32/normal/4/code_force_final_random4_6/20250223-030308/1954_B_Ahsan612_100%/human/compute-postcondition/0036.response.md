The `print(-1)` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of any of the variables `t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `same`, `num`, or `minn`. The `print` statement simply outputs the integer `-1`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: The variables `t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `same`, `num`, and `minn` are described, but their exact values are not specified beyond their relationships and constraints.
2. **Code Analysis**: The `print(-1)` statement is an explicit command to output the value `-1`.

Since the `print` statement is independent of the values of the variables mentioned, the output will always be `-1`.

Output: **-1**
