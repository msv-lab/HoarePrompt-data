You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program:
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)
        if minn == inf or minn == len(ar):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive equal elements in the list `a`. If all elements in the list are the same or if there is only one element, it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the determined minimum length for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to verify its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Beautiful Array Definition**:
   - An array is considered "beautiful" if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly choosing an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le |a| - 1 \)) such that \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \) and replacing \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \).

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful.
   - If it is impossible to make the array stop being beautiful, return -1.

### Program Analysis:
The program attempts to solve this problem by:
1. Iterating through the array to find contiguous segments of the same number.
2. Keeping track of the minimum length of these segments.
3. If the minimum segment length is the entire array length, it returns -1 (indicating the array cannot be made non-beautiful).
4. Otherwise, it returns the minimum segment length as the answer.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Element Array**: The program should return -1 for a single-element array since it cannot be made non-beautiful.
   - **All Elements Same**: The program correctly returns -1 for arrays where all elements are the same.
   - **Alternating Elements**: The program should correctly identify the smallest segment that can be removed to break the beauty of the array.

2. **Logic**:
   - The logic for finding the minimum segment length seems correct.
   - However, the program does not handle the case where the array length is 1 separately, which might lead to incorrect results.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with various cases to ensure it works correctly:

1. **Single Element Array**:
   - Input: `1\n1\n1`
   - Expected Output: `-1`
   - Actual Output: `-1` (Correct)

2. **All Elements Same**:
   - Input: `1\n5\n1 1 1 1 1`
   - Expected Output: `-1`
   - Actual Output: `-1` (Correct)

3. **Alternating Elements**:
   - Input: `1\n5\n1 2 1 2 1`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Actual Output: `1` (Correct)

4. **Multiple Segments**:
   - Input: `1\n7\n3 3 3 5 3 3 3`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Actual Output: `3` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program seems to handle the provided examples and edge cases correctly. There are no obvious issues in the logic, and it correctly identifies the minimum segment length to remove or returns -1 when the array cannot be made non-beautiful.

**Correctness: True**

### Explanation:
The program correctly identifies the minimum segment length that can be removed to break the beauty of the array or returns -1 if the array cannot be made non-beautiful. It handles various edge cases, including single-element arrays and arrays where all elements are the same.
