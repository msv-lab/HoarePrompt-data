The code snippet `minn = min(minn, same)` compares the current value of `minn` with the value of `same` and assigns the smaller of the two to `minn`. Given the initial state, `minn` is 1 and `same` is 1. Therefore, `minn` remains 1 after the execution of the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer and `n` must be at least 6; `ar` is a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]` with `n > 1`; `i` is 6; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[6]`; `minn` is 1.**
