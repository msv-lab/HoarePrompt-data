The code snippet updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. Given that `minn` is initially `inf` and `same` is `1`, `minn` will be updated to `1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]` with `n > 1`; `i` is 2; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[2]`; `minn` is 1**.
