The code snippet updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. Given the initial conditions, we need to consider the possible values of `minn` and `same`.

- If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2. Since `minn` is initially 1, `min(minn, same)` will be `min(1, 2)`, which is 1. Therefore, `minn` remains 1.
- If `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `same` is 1, and `minn` is also 1. In this case, `min(minn, same)` will be `min(1, 1)`, which is 1. Therefore, `minn` remains 1.

In both scenarios, `minn` remains 1. The values of `t`, `ar`, `n`, `i`, `num`, and `same` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 (after decrementing by 1); `ar` is a new list of integers with length greater than 1; `n` must be greater than `i`; `i` is either 3 or 4; `num` is `ar[i]`; if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2; otherwise, `i` is 2, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1, and `num` is `ar[2]`; `minn` is 1.**
