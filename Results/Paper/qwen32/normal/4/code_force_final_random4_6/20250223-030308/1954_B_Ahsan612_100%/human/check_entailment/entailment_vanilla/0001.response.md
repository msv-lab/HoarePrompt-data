Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a given beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. A beautiful array is one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a[i]` with `a[i-1]` if `a[i-1] == a[i+1]`. If it's impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements, the answer should be `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `ar` itself. The goal is to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `same` is initialized to 1 to count the length of the current sequence of identical elements.
   - `num` is set to the first element of the array.
   - `minn` is set to infinity to track the minimum length of any sequence of identical elements.

2. **Loop through the array**:
   - The loop iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the current element is the same as `num`, it increments `same`.
   - If the current element is different from `num`, it updates `minn` with the minimum value between `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and updates `num` to the current element.
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 at the end of each iteration.

3. **Final update**:
   - After the loop, `minn` is updated one last time with the minimum value between `minn` and `same`.

4. **Determine the result**:
   - If `minn` is still infinity (which shouldn't happen as it's initialized to `same` at least once) or if `minn` is equal to the length of the array (meaning all elements are the same), the program outputs `-1` because it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful.
   - Otherwise, it outputs `minn`, which represents the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

### Potential Issues:
- The program correctly identifies that if all elements are the same, the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.
- The logic to find the minimum sequence length seems correct as it keeps track of the length of each sequence of identical elements and updates the minimum length.
- However, the program does not correctly handle cases where the array has multiple sequences of identical elements. For example, in the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the program will incorrectly output `1` instead of `3` because it only considers the length of the first sequence it encounters that is not the entire array.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not always provide the correct minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
