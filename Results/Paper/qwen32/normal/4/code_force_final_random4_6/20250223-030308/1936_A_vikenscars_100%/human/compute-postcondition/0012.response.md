Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the length of the permutation sequence, where 2 <= n <= 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `ans` holds the return value of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`; `max_item_idx` is equal to the new value of `i`.**

This means that `max_item_idx` now holds the value of the newly incremented `i`, while all other variables retain their previously described properties and values.
