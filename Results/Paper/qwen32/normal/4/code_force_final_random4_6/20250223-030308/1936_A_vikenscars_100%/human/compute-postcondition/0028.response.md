The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the largest index for which the condition in the loop was met. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. The values of `max_item_idx`, `pair_idx`, `n`, `ans1`, and `ans2` should remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:
- Increment `i` by 1.

State: **`max_item_idx` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns `'<'`. If `ans1` is `'<'`, `pair_idx` is equal to `max_item_idx`. If `ans1` is `'='`, then `pair_idx` is set to `i` if `ans2` is `'>'`; otherwise, `pair_idx` remains equal to `max_item_idx`. `n` is greater than 0, and `ans1` retains its value as either `'<'` or `'='`. If `ans1` is `'='`, `ans2` retains its original value. `i` is incremented by 1.**
