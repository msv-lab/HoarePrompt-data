Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the length of the permutation sequence, where 2 <= n <= 10^4. If `ans` was equal to '<', then `max_item_idx` is `i`. Otherwise, `max_item_idx` is updated to `i`. `ans` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**

In natural language: The variable `max_item_idx` is updated to the current value of `i`. The other variables, including `n`, `ans`, and the incremented value of `i`, remain as per their previous definitions and states.
