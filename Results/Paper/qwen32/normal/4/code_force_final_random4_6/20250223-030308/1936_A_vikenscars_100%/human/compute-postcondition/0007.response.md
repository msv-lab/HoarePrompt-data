The code snippet updates the value of `ans` by calling `func_1` with specific arguments. The values of `max_item_idx` and `i` are used as arguments for `func_1`. After the function call, `ans` is assigned the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`. The values of `n` and the condition for `max_item_idx` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the length of the permutation sequence, where 2 <= n <= 10^4. If `ans` was equal to '<', then `max_item_idx` is `i`. Otherwise, `max_item_idx` remains 0. `ans` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
