In the given for loop, the loop head involves the variable `i` and the range function `range(1, n)`. The loop will execute if the range function produces at least one value, which means `n` must be greater than 1. 

Given that `n` is an integer representing the length of the permutation sequence where `2 <= n <= 10^4`, the initial value of `n` already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `n`. The variable `i` is the loop variable and its initial value is determined by the range function and not something we need to adjust before the loop starts.

The variable `max_item_idx` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, since it is part of the initial state, we should include it in the final state description.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts, with the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, is:

State: **`n` is an integer representing the length of the permutation sequence, where 2 <= n <= 10^4; `max_item_idx` is 0**
