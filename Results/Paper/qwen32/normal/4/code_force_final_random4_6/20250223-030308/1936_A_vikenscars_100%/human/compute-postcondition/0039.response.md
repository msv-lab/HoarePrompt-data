The code snippet provided updates the value of `ans2` by calling the function `func_1` with specific arguments. The other variables (`max_item_idx`, `pair_idx`, `n`, `ans1`, `i`) remain unchanged unless `ans1` was `'='` and `ans2` was `'>'`, in which case `ans2` would have already been updated in a previous step. Since the current line of code reassigns `ans2` regardless of the previous conditions, the new value of `ans2` is determined solely by the function call `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `ans2`, which is now the result of the function call `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)`.

Output State: **`max_item_idx` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns `'<'`. If `ans1` is `'<'`, `pair_idx` is set to `i`. If `ans1` is `'='` and `ans2` is `'>'`, then `pair_idx` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `pair_idx` remains equal to `max_item_idx`. `n` is greater than 0, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`. `ans2` is the result of `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)`. `i` is incremented by 1.**
