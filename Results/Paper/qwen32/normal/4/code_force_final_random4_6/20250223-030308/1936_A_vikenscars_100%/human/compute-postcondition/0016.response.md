To ensure that the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The state before the loop starts mentions `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx`, but these are not directly part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, because `range(n)` will generate at least one value (0) if `n` is 1 or greater. Therefore, we need to ensure `n` is greater than 0.

The initial value of `i` before the loop starts is not something we can adjust directly, as it is set by the `range` function in the loop head. However, we can ensure that `n` is set appropriately so that the loop can execute.

State: **`max_item_idx` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns `'<'`; `pair_idx` is equal to `max_item_idx`; `n` must be greater than 0**
