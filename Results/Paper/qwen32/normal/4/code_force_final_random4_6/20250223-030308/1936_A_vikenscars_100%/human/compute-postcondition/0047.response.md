Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts an integer `n` representing the length of a permutation sequence. It determines and prints two indices: the largest index `max_item_idx` for which a specific comparison function `func_1` returns `'<'` when comparing it with itself, and another index `pair_idx` which is the index of the item that is greater than all other items according to the comparison function `func_1`.**
