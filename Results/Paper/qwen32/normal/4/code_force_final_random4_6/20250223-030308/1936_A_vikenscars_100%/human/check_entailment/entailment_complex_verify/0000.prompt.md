You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, c, and d are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n, where n is the length of the permutation p.
def func_1(a, b, c, d):

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes four integer parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, each within the range 0 to n-1, where n is the length of a permutation `p`. It prints a formatted string `? a b c d` and returns the value of the subsequent input, which is expected to be a string in the same format.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `n` representing the length of a permutation sequence. It determines and prints two indices: the largest index `max_item_idx` for which a specific comparison function `func_1` returns `'<'` when comparing it with itself, and another index `pair_idx` which is the index of the item that is greater than all other items according to the comparison function `func_1`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not guarantee that it will always find the pair of indices (i, j) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized. The algorithm seems to be attempting to find the maximum element in the permutation and then finding a pair with the maximum XOR value, but it does not handle all possible cases correctly.

Here are a few points that indicate why this code might not work:

1. **Finding the Maximum Element**: The algorithm correctly identifies the maximum element in the permutation (the element with the highest value). However, the maximum XOR value is not necessarily between the maximum element and another element in the permutation.

2. **Finding the Pair with Maximum XOR**: After finding the maximum element, the algorithm compares it with other elements to find a pair with the maximum XOR value. However, the comparison logic might not always pick the correct pair. For example, if there are multiple elements that can give a high XOR value with the maximum element, the algorithm might not correctly identify the one with the highest XOR value.

3. **Handling Ties**: The code handles ties by checking if the XOR value is the same for multiple pairs, but it might not correctly handle all cases where multiple pairs have the same XOR value.

To ensure correctness, the algorithm should be more systematic in finding the pair with the maximum XOR value. A possible approach is to use a more exhaustive search or a more sophisticated strategy to ensure that the maximum XOR value is found within the allowed number of queries.

Here is an example where the program might not work correctly:

Consider the permutation \( p = [3, 1, 2, 0] \). The maximum element is 3. The XOR values are:
- \( 3 \oplus 1 = 2 \)
- \( 3 \oplus 2 = 1 \)
- \( 3 \oplus 0 = 3 \)
- \( 1 \oplus 2 = 3 \)
- \( 1 \oplus 0 = 1 \)
- \( 2 \oplus 0 = 2 \)

The maximum XOR value is 3, which can be achieved by the pairs (3, 0) and (1, 2). However, the algorithm might not correctly identify one of these pairs as the answer.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not guarantee finding the pair with the maximum XOR value in all cases.
