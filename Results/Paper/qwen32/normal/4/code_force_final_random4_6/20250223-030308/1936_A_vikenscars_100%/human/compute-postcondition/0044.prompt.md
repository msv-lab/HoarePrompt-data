Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `max_item_idx` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns `'<'`; `pair_idx` is equal to `max_item_idx`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    ans1 = func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)
    if ans1 == '<':
        pair_idx = i
    elif ans1 == '=':
        ans2 = func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)
        if ans2 == '>':
            pair_idx = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `max_item_idx` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns `'<'`. If `ans1` is `'<'`, `pair_idx` is equal to `max_item_idx`. If `ans1` is `'='`, then `pair_idx` is set to `i` if `ans2` is `'>'`; otherwise, `pair_idx` remains equal to `max_item_idx`. `n` is greater than 0, and `ans1` retains its value as either `'<'` or `'='`. If `ans1` is `'='`, `ans2` retains its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `max_item_idx` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns `'<'`. If `ans1` is `'<'`, `pair_idx` is set to `i`. If `ans1` is `'='` and `ans2` is `'>'`, then `pair_idx` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `pair_idx` remains equal to `max_item_idx`. `n` is greater than 0, and `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`. If `ans1` was `'='`, `ans2` retains its original value unless `ans1` is `'='` and `ans2` is `'>'`, in which case `ans2` is the result of `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)`. `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `max_item_idx` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns `'<'`. If `ans1` is `'<'`, `pair_idx` is set to `i`. If `ans1` is `'='` and `ans2` is `'>'`, then `pair_idx` is set to `i` from the `if` part. If `ans1` is `'='` and `ans2` is not `'>'`, `ans2` is updated to the result of `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)` and `pair_idx` is set to `i` if `ans2` becomes `'>'`. Otherwise, `pair_idx` remains equal to `max_item_idx`. `n` is greater than 0, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`, and `i` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
