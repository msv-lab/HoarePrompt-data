To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it effectively finds a pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized, using at most \(3n\) queries.

### Analysis:

1. **Finding the Maximum Element**:
    - The first loop in `func_2` iterates through all indices from 1 to \(n-1\) and uses the `func_1` function to compare the bitwise OR of the current maximum element (`max_item_idx`) with the bitwise OR of itself with the current index `i`.
    - If the result is `<`, it means the bitwise OR of the current index `i` with itself is greater than the bitwise OR of the current maximum element with itself, which implies `i` is likely a larger number in the permutation (because OR-ing a number with itself just gives the number itself).
    - The loop effectively finds the index of the maximum element in the permutation, \(p_{max\_item\_idx}\), because the maximum element in a permutation of \(\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}\) will have the highest bitwise OR with itself.

2. **Finding the Pair with Maximum XOR**:
    - The second loop in `func_2` iterates through all indices from 0 to \(n-1\) and again uses `func_1` to compare the bitwise OR of the maximum element with the current pair index with the bitwise OR of the maximum element with the current index `i`.
    - If the result is `<`, it means the bitwise OR of the maximum element with `i` is greater than the bitwise OR of the maximum element with the current pair index, so `i` is a better candidate for the pair.
    - If the result is `=`, it means the bitwise OR of the maximum element with `i` is equal to the bitwise OR of the maximum element with the current pair index. In this case, it performs an additional comparison to determine if `i` should replace the current pair index.
    - The additional comparison (`ans2 = func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)`) checks if the bitwise OR of `pair_idx` with itself is greater than the bitwise OR of `i` with itself. If it is, the current pair index is kept; otherwise, `i` replaces the current pair index.
    - This loop effectively finds an index `pair_idx` such that \(p_{max\_item\_idx} \oplus p_{pair\_idx}\) is maximized.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find a pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized by first finding the maximum element in the permutation and then finding the element that maximizes the XOR with this maximum element. The number of queries used is \(2n\) (one loop for finding the maximum element and one loop for finding the pair), which is well within the allowed \(3n\) queries.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
