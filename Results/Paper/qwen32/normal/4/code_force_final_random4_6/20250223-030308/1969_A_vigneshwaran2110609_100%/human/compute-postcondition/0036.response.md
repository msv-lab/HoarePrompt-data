The code snippet `flag = True` sets the variable `flag` to `True`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is the total number of iterations, `x` is greater than `n`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `flag` is `True`.**
