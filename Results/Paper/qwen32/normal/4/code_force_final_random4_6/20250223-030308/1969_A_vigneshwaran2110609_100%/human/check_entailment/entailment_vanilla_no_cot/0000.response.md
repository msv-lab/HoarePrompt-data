Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party. The current implementation checks for mutual best friendships and prints 2 if found; otherwise, it prints 3. However, this approach does not account for all possible scenarios and may not yield the correct result in all cases.

For example, consider the test case:
```
2
4
2 3 4 1
4
4 3 2 1
```
The correct output should be:
```
3
3
```
But the provided program will output:
```
2
2
```
This is because the program only checks for mutual best friendships and does not consider other possible combinations of invitations that could result in at least 2 friends coming to the party with fewer than 3 invitations in some cases.

To solve the problem correctly, a more comprehensive approach is needed, such as finding the minimum vertex cover in a bipartite graph representation of the friendships or using a different algorithmic strategy to determine the minimum number of invitations required.
