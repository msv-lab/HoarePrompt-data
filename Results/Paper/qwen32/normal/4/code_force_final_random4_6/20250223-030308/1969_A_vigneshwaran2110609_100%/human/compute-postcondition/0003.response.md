The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` reads a line of input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the line into a list of strings based on spaces, and then converts each string in the list to an integer. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `l`.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `n`, `p`, and `x` remain unchanged. The new variable `l` is introduced and assigned the list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer read from input such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct; `x` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers read from input.**
