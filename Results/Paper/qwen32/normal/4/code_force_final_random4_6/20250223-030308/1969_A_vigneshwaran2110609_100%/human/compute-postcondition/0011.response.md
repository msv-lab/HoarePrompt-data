Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct; `x` is an integer greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers; `i` is `x-1`; `flag` is True.**

In the output state, the variable `flag` has been assigned the value `True`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `x`, `l`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
