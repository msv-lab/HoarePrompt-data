The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `l`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `x` remains an input integer.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is the total number of iterations, `x` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
