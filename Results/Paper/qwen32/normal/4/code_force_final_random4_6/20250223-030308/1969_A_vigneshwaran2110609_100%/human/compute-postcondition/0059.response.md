Postcondition: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is the total number of iterations, `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input. If `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`, then `flag` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `flag` and the loop continues.**
