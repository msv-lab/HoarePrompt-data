Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct; `x` is an integer greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers; `i` is `x-1`. If `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`, then `flag` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
