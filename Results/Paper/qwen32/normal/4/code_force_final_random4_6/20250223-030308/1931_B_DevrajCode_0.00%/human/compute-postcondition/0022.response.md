Functionality: **The function checks if it's possible to redistribute the water in the containers such that each container has the same amount of water, given that the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers. It returns 'Yes' if redistribution is possible without any container having a negative amount of water at any point during the process; otherwise, it returns 'No'.**
