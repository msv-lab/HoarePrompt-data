Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues and does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Let's go through the code and identify the problems:

1. **Incorrect Input Parsing**: The program reads the entire input at once and tries to parse it, but it does not correctly separate the different test cases. The variable `n` is set to the total number of test cases, and `a` is set to the entire list of water amounts across all test cases. This is incorrect because each test case has its own `n` and `a`.

2. **Function Call Before Definition**: The function `func_1` is called before it is defined. This will result in a `NameError`.

3. **Logic Error**: The logic in `func_1` is incorrect. The function checks if the cumulative difference between the current water amount and the target is negative, which is not sufficient to determine if it's possible to equalize the water levels. It does not correctly simulate the operation of pouring water from one container to another.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

index = 0
t = int(data[index])
index += 1

results = []

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    
    total_water = sum(a)
    if total_water % n != 0:
        results.append('No')
    else:
        target = total_water // n
        container = 0
        possible = True
        for water in a:
            container += water - target
            if container < 0:
                possible = False
                break
        results.append('Yes' if possible else 'No')

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

In this corrected version:
- The program correctly reads and processes each test case separately.
- The function `func_1` is replaced with inline logic.
- The logic checks if the cumulative difference between the current water amount and the target is negative, which correctly determines if it's possible to equalize the water levels.

Since the original program does not handle the input parsing and logic correctly, it is incorrect.
