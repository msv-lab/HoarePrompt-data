The given code snippet updates the variable `container` by adding the difference between `water` and `target` to it. Here's the new value of `container` after the operation:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `total_water % n` is equal to 0, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`, `container` is `container + (water - target)`, `water` is the next element in the list `a`**

In natural language, the output state means that `n`, `a`, `total_water`, `total_water % n`, `target`, and `water` retain their initial values. However, `container` is updated to be its previous value plus the difference between `water` and `target`.
