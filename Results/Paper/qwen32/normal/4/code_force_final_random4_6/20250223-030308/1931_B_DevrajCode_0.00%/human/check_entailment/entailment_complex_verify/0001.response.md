### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and the annotated version to ensure the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We need to determine if it's possible to redistribute water such that all containers have the same amount of water.
- The total amount of water is divisible by `n`, so the target amount of water per container is an integer.
- Water can only be poured from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index.

#### Key Insight:
- The program uses a running total (`container`) to track the excess or deficit of water up to the current container.
- If at any point the running total becomes negative, it means there is not enough water in the previous containers to make up for the deficit in the current container, making it impossible to equalize the water.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the input and splits it into a list of strings.
   - The first element is the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of initial water amounts `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case.
   - It calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. This check is indeed redundant given the problem constraints.
   - It calculates the target amount of water per container (`target = total_water // n`).
   - It iterates through the list of water amounts, maintaining a running total of the excess (or deficit) water (`container`).
   - If at any point the running total of excess water becomes negative, it returns "No", indicating that it is impossible to equalize the water.
   - If the loop completes without the running total becoming negative, it returns "Yes".

#### Annotations:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
- The state right before the function call is correctly described.
- The state after calculating `total_water` and `target` is correctly described.
- The state after the loop is correctly described, indicating that `container` should be 0 if redistribution is possible.

#### Correctness:
- The logic of the program correctly reflects the problem's requirements.
- The program ensures that at no point does the cumulative deficit of water exceed the excess water that can be poured from the previous containers.
- The program handles the constraints and examples provided correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and examples. The annotations support the correctness of the program's behavior.

Final: **True**
