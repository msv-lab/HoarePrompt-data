The code snippet provided modifies the `container` variable by adding the difference between `water` and `target` to it. However, the variable `water` is not defined in the initial state, which means we cannot directly compute the new value of `container`. Assuming `water` is a variable that holds some integer value, the new value of `container` would be the previous value of `container` plus `water - target`.

Given that `container` is initially 0, the new value of `container` would be `water - target`.

Since the exact value of `water` is not provided, we can only express the new value of `container` in terms of `water` and `target`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `total_water % n` is equal to 0, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`, `container` is `water - target`.**
