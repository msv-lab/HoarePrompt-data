The code snippet provided initializes a variable `container` to 0. This action does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, `total_water`, or `target`. Therefore, the output state will reflect this initialization.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, and `total_water % n` is equal to 0; `target` is equal to `total_water // n`; `container` is 0.**
