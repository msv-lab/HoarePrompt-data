Let's carefully re-evaluate the provided program and the original assessment based on the problem description and the function summary.

### Problem Recap:
- We have `n` containers, each with an initial amount of water `a_i`.
- The total amount of water is divisible by `n`, meaning the average amount of water per container is an integer.
- We need to determine if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by pouring water from one container to another, with the constraint that water can only be poured from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index.

### Key Insight:
- For the operation to be valid, the amount of water in any container `i` should not be less than the target amount of water (which is the total water divided by `n`) at any point during the process of pouring water.
- If at any point, the cumulative excess (or deficit) of water in the containers from the first to the current one is negative, it means we cannot pour enough water from the previous containers to make up for the deficit in the current one, and hence, it is impossible to equalize the water.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the input and splits it into a list of strings.
   - The first element is the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of initial water amounts `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case.
   - It calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. However, the problem guarantees that the total water is divisible by `n` for each test case, so this check is redundant.
   - It calculates the target amount of water per container (`target = total_water // n`).
   - It then iterates through the list of water amounts, maintaining a running total of the excess (or deficit) water (`container`).
   - If at any point the running total of excess water becomes negative, it returns "No", indicating that it is impossible to equalize the water.
   - If the loop completes without the running total becoming negative, it returns "Yes".

### Function Summary:
- The function checks if it's possible to redistribute the water in the containers such that each container has the same amount of water, given that the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers. It returns 'Yes' if redistribution is possible without any container having a negative amount of water at any point during the process; otherwise, it returns 'No'.

### Evaluation:
- The logic of the program correctly reflects the problem's requirements.
- The program ensures that at no point does the cumulative deficit of water exceed the excess water that can be poured from the previous containers.
- The program handles the constraints and examples provided correctly.

### Issues in the Code:
- The program assumes that the entire input is read at once and processed in one go, which is not how the typical input handling works in competitive programming. The input should be read line by line for each test case.
- The function `func_1` is called with the entire input list `a`, which includes all test cases concatenated. This is incorrect and will lead to incorrect results.

### Correct Implementation:
To correctly handle multiple test cases, the input should be processed line by line. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
index = 0
t = int(data[index])
index += 1
results = []

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    results.append(func_1(n, a))

for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if total_water % n != 0:
        return 'No'
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'
```

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the original code, the original assessment is inaccurate. The program does not correctly handle multiple test cases as intended.

Final: **False**
