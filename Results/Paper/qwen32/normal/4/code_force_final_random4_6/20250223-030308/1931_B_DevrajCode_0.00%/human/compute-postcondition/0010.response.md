Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `total_water % n` is equal to 0, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`, `container` is `water - target`, and `container` is greater than or equal to 0**
