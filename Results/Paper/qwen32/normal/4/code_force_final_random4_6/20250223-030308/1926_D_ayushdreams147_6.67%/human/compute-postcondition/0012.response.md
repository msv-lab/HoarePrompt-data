The code snippet `count[num] -= 1` decrements the value associated with the key `num` in the dictionary `count` by 1. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged, and `num` continues to hold the next element in the list `a` that hasn't been processed yet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, `num` is the next element in the list `a` that hasn't been processed yet, and `count[num]` is decreased by 1.**
