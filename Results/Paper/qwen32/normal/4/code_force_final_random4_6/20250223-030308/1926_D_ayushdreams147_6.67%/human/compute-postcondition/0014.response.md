The only variable in the loop head is `num`, which is the current element being processed from the list `a`. According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in the list `a` that haven't been processed yet.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31.
- `num` is the next element in the list `a` that hasn't been processed yet.

To prepare for the next iteration:
- `num` should be the next element in the list `a` after the current `num`.

Since the loop iterates over each element in `a`, `num` should be updated to the next element in the list. Therefore, if `num` was `a[i]` in the previous iteration, it should now be `a[i+1]`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, `num` is the next element in the list `a` that hasn't been processed yet (i.e., if `num` was `a[i]` in the previous iteration, it is now `a[i+1]`)**

However, since we don't have the specific index `i` in the state, the most accurate way to describe the state is to say that `num` is the next element in the list `a` that hasn't been processed yet.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, `num` is the next element in the list `a` that hasn't been processed yet**
