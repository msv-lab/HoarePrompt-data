### Reasoning:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by using a dictionary to count the occurrences of numbers and their bitwise flipped versions. However, the logic used in the function `func_1` does not correctly determine the minimum number of groups required based on the problem statement.

The key requirement is that no two numbers in the same group can have the same bit values in any of the 31 least significant bits. This means that each group must contain numbers that have unique bit patterns in those 31 bits.

The provided function `func_1` does not correctly implement this logic. Instead, it tries to count numbers and their flipped versions, which is not relevant to the problem at hand. The correct approach would be to use a bitmask to track the presence of bit patterns and determine the number of unique patterns.

### Correctness:
Given the explanation above, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
