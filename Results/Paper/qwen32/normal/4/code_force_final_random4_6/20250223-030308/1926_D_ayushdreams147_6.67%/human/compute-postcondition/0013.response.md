Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, `num` is the next element in the list `a` that hasn't been processed yet. If `num` was not in `count`, `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` is incremented by 1 and `res` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count[num]` is decreased by 1.**
