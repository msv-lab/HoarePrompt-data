Postcondition: **`k` is `e.index(d[j]) + 1` or `k` is `j + 1`, `i` is `b + 2`, `a` is greater than `b + 2`, `b` is greater than 0, `c` is the second new input integer, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the new input string, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `j` is `j + 1`. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, then `k` is specifically `j + 1`.**
