Output State: **`k` is `j + 1`, `i` is `b + 2`, `a` is greater than `b + 2`, `b` is greater than 0, `c` is a new input integer, `d` is a new input string, `e` is a new input string, and the character at index `j` of `d` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k` to the end of `e`. Additionally, either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`.**

In simple terms, the value of `k` has been updated to `j + 1`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
