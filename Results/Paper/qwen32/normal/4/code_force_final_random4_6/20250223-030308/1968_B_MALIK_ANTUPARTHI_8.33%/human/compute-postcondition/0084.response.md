Postcondition: **`k` is either `e.index(d[j]) + 1` if the character at index `j` of `d` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k` to the end of `e`, or `k` is `j` if the character `d[j]` is not in the substring `e[k:]`. In both cases, `i` is `b + 2`, `a` is greater than `b + 2`, `b` is greater than 0, `c` is the second new input integer, `d` is the new input string, and `e` is the new input string. Additionally, if `k` equals `e.index(d[j]) + 1`, then either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement in both cases.**
