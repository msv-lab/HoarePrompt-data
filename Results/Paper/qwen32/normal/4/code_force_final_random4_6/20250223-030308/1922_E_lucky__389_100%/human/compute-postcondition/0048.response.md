To determine the final state of the loop, we need to analyze how the loop operates and how the variables change with each iteration.

The loop condition is `while 2 ** i <= x:`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `2` raised to the power of `i` is less than or equal to `x`. 

Starting with `i = 0`, the loop will increment `i` by 1 in each iteration until `2 ** i` exceeds `x`. Therefore, the final value of `i` will be the smallest integer such that `2 ** i > x`. In other words, `i` will be equal to the highest integer for which `2 ** i` is less than or equal to `x`, plus one.

Given that the loop executes until `2 ** i` is greater than `x`, the final value of `i` will be `floor(log2(x)) + 1`.

Since the loop does not modify `x` or any other variable outside the loop head (`i`), the only variable that changes is `i`.

**Output State:** `i` is the smallest integer such that `2 ** i > x`, which is `floor(log2(x)) + 1`.

Output State: **i is the smallest integer such that 2 ** i > x.**
