To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ansv))` statement, let's break down the given initial state:

1. **t**: This is an integer representing the number of test cases, with \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
2. **X**: For each test case, \(X\) is an integer such that \(2 \leq X \leq 10^{18}\).
3. **x**: This variable is initialized to 0.
4. **subseq_lens**: This is a list that contains the lengths of all subsequences of powers of 2 that sum up to the original \(X\).
5. **mx**: This variable holds the maximum length of these subsequences.
6. **ansv**: This is a list that contains elements from `subseq_lens[1]` to `subseq_lens[len(subseq_lens) - 1]`.

The task is to print the length of the `ansv` list.

### Understanding `subseq_lens` and `ansv`:
- `subseq_lens` contains the lengths of all subsequences of powers of 2 that sum up to \(X\).
- `ansv` is derived from `subseq_lens` by excluding the first element (`subseq_lens[0]`).

### Determining the Length of `ansv`:
- The length of `ansv` will be the length of `subseq_lens` minus 1 because `ansv` excludes the first element of `subseq_lens`.

### Conclusion:
The output of `print(len(ansv))` will be the number of subsequences of powers of 2 that sum up to \(X\), excluding the first subsequence length in `subseq_lens`.

Since the exact value of `subseq_lens` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `len(ansv)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the length of `ansv`.

Output: **len(ansv) (where len(ansv) is the length of subseq_lens minus 1)**
