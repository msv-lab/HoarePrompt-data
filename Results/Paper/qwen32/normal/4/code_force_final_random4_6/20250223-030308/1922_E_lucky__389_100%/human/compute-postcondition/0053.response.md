Output State: **`i` is the smallest integer such that 2, and `i` is not equal to 0; `subseq_lens` contains the value `i - 1`; `x` is decreased by `2 ** (i - 1)`**.

In simpler terms, the value of `x` is reduced by `2` raised to the power of `i - 1`. The values of `i` and `subseq_lens` remain unchanged.
