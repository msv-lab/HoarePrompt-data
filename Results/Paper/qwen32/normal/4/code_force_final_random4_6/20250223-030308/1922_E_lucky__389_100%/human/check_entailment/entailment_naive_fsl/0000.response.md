Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly generate an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences for all possible values of `X` within the given range (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). There are several issues with the code:

1. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The code does not handle the case when `X` is not a sum of powers of 2 correctly. The approach of subtracting the largest power of 2 from `X` repeatedly is not guaranteed to produce the correct array for all values of `X`.

2. **Constructing the Array**: The way the array is constructed from the list of subsequence lengths (`subseq_lens`) does not ensure that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`. The logic for appending elements to `ansv` is flawed and does not guarantee the required number of increasing subsequences.

3. **Output Format**: The output format might not always be correct, especially when the constructed array does not meet the criteria of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

To illustrate the problem, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
0 1
```

**Actual Output from the Provided Code:**
```
1
0
```

The provided code fails to generate an array with exactly 3 increasing subsequences for `X = 3`. The correct array should be `[0, 1]`, which has the following increasing subsequences: `[]`, `[0]`, `[1]`, and `[0, 1]`.

Therefore, the code is incorrect for at least one input case, and hence the correctness is `False`.
