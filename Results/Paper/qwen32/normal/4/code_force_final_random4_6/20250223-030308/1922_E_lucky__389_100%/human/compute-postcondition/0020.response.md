The code appends the value of `i - 1` to the list `subseq_lens`. The other variables (`t`, `X`, `x`, `mx`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is an integer, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value `i - 1`, `mx` is 0, `i` is an integer such that i is not equal to 0**.
