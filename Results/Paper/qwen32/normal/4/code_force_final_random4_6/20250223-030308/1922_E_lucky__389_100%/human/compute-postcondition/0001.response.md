The provided code snippet initializes an empty list `subseq_lens`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `X`, or `x`. Therefore, the values of `t`, `X`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, X is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is an input integer; `subseq_lens` is an empty list.**
