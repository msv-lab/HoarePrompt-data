Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads an integer `X` from the input, where `X` is at least 2. It calculates the lengths of subsequences of powers of 2 that sum up to `X` and prints the number of such subsequences minus one, followed by the lengths of these subsequences (excluding the first one). If `X` is 2, it directly prints 1 and 0. The function does not return any value.**
