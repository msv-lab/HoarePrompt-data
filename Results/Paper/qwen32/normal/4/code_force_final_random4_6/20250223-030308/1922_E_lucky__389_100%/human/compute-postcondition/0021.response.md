The value of `x` is decremented by `2 ** (i - 1)`. The value of `t`, `X`, `subseq_lens`, `mx`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is an integer decreased by `2 ** (i - 1)`, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value `i - 1`, `mx` is 0, `i` is an integer such that i is not equal to 0**.
