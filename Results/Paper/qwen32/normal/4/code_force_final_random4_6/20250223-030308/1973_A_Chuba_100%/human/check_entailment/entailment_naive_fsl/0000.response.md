Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers representing the scores of three players. The program then determines the maximum number of draws that could have occurred or returns -1 if the scores are inconsistent.

Here's the program for reference:
```python
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)
```

### Logic Verification

1. **Odd Total Points Check**:
   - The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because an odd total score is impossible since each game results in an even number of points (either 0+2, 1+1, or 2+0).
   - This logic is correct as per the problem description.

2. **Calculating Maximum Draws**:
   - If the total points are even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2}
     \]
   - The formula ensures that the maximum number of draws is calculated correctly by considering the points that cannot be attributed to draws alone (i.e., points that must be attributed to wins and losses).

### Testing with Example Cases

Let's verify the program with the provided example cases:

1. **Input**: `0 0 0`
   - Total points: `0` (even)
   - Maximum draws: `0`
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **Input**: `0 1 1`
   - Total points: `2` (even)
   - Maximum draws: `1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Input**: `1 1 1`
   - Total points: `3` (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

4. **Input**: `1 1 2`
   - Total points: `4` (even)
   - Maximum draws: `2`
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Input**: `3 3 3`
   - Total points: `9` (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

6. **Input**: `3 4 5`
   - Total points: `12` (even)
   - Maximum draws: `6`
   - Output: `6` (Correct)

7. **Input**: `1 1 10`
   - Total points: `12` (even)
   - Maximum draws: `2`
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all the provided example cases and adheres to the logic described in the problem statement. It correctly identifies impossible score distributions and calculates the maximum number of draws for valid score distributions.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or identify inconsistent scores for all valid inputs.
