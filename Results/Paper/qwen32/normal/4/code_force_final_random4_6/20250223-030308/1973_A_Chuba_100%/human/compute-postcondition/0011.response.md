The `print` statement in the given code snippet is `print('-1')`. This statement directly prints the string `'-1'` to the output, regardless of the values of the variables `t` and `v` as described in the initial state.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state provides information about the variables `t` and `v`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement explicitly specifies the string `'-1'` to be printed.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **-1**
