The code snippet `v = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into parts, converts each part into an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `v`. This means `v` will be updated to reflect the integers provided in the input. The other variables `t` and `result` are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `v` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
