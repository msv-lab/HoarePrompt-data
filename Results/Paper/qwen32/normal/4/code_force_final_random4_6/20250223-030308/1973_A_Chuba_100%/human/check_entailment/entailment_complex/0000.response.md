### Reasoning:
The given Python program is designed to determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened based on the scores of three players in a series of chess games. Here’s a breakdown of the logic and correctness:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players. These scores are guaranteed to be in non-decreasing order (`p1 <= p2 <= p3`).

2. **Odd Sum Check:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because it’s impossible to have an odd total number of points if each game results in a total of 2 points (either 2-0 or 1-1).

3. **Draw Calculation:**
   - If the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum possible number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \left(\frac{p1 + p2 + p3 - \max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)}{2}\right)
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the fact that each draw contributes 2 points in total, and the maximum number of draws can be determined by adjusting for any imbalance in the scores.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles cases where no games were played (`p1 = p2 = p3 = 0`), resulting in `0` draws.
   - It also correctly identifies impossible score distributions, such as `p1 = 1`, `p2 = 1`, `p3 = 1`, by checking the odd sum condition.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or identify impossible score distributions. Given the constraints and the problem description, the program handles all valid scenarios as described in the problem statement and examples.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
