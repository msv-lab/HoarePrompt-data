The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'-1'`. This output is independent of the variables `t` and `v` as they are not used within the `print` statement. The initial state only provides conditions and descriptions about `t` and `v`, but these do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0 and `v` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
2. The `print` statement is `print('-1')`, which directly outputs the string `'-1'`.
3. Since the `print` statement does not reference `t` or `v`, their values do not influence the output.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'-1'`.

Output: **-1**
