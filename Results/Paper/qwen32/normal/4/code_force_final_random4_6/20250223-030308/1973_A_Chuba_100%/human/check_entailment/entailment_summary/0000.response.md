### Reasoning:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws based on the scores of the three players. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Sum of Scores Check**: The program first checks if the total sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. Since each game results in a total of either 2 points (in case of a win/loss) or 2 points (in case of a draw), the total points awarded in all games must be even. If the sum of the scores is odd, the program correctly outputs `-1`.

2. **Calculation of Maximum Draws**:
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2}
     \]
   - This formula works as follows:
     - `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]` is the total points awarded in all games.
     - `v[2] - v[0] - v[1]` calculates the excess points of the highest-scoring player (`v[2]`) over the sum of the other two players (`v[0] + v[1]`). This excess must come from wins, not draws.
     - The `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that if `v[2]` is not greater than `v[0] + v[1]`, the excess is considered as 0, meaning all points can come from draws.
     - The total points minus the excess points from wins divided by 2 gives the maximum number of draws.

### Verification with Examples:

- **Test Case 1**: `0 0 0`
  - Sum is 0 (even).
  - Maximum draws: \((0 + 0 + 0 - \max(0, 0 - 0 - 0)) / 2 = 0\).
  - Output: `0`.

- **Test Case 2**: `0 1 1`
  - Sum is 2 (even).
  - Maximum draws: \((0 + 1 + 1 - \max(0, 1 - 0 - 1)) / 2 = 1\).
  - Output: `1`.

- **Test Case 3**: `1 1 1`
  - Sum is 3 (odd).
  - Output: `-1`.

- **Test Case 4**: `1 1 2`
  - Sum is 4 (even).
  - Maximum draws: \((1 + 1 + 2 - \max(0, 2 - 1 - 1)) / 2 = 2\).
  - Output: `2`.

- **Test Case 5**: `3 3 3`
  - Sum is 9 (odd).
  - Output: `-1`.

- **Test Case 6**: `3 4 5`
  - Sum is 12 (even).
  - Maximum draws: \((3 + 4 + 5 - \max(0, 5 - 3 - 4)) / 2 = 6\).
  - Output: `6`.

- **Test Case 7**: `1 1 10`
  - Sum is 12 (even).
  - Maximum draws: \((1 + 1 + 10 - \max(0, 10 - 1 - 1)) / 2 = 2\).
  - Output: `2`.

The program correctly handles all these cases as per the provided examples.
