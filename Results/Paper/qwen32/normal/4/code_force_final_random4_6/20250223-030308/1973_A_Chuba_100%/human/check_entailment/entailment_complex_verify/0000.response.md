Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning based on the provided annotations and the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three integer scores representing the scores of three players. The program checks if the total sum of the scores is odd or even. If it's odd, it prints `-1` because an odd total score is impossible since each game results in an even number of points (either 0+2, 1+1, or 2+0). If the total sum is even, it calculates the maximum number of draws using a specific formula and prints the result.

### Logic Verification

1. **Odd Total Points Check**:
   - The program correctly checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, it prints `-1`. This logic is correct because an odd total score cannot be achieved with the given scoring rules.

2. **Calculating Maximum Draws**:
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2}
     \]
   - This formula is designed to account for the points that cannot be attributed to draws alone. The term `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` calculates the excess points that must be attributed to wins and losses, ensuring that the remaining points can be evenly distributed as draws.

### Testing with Example Cases

Let's verify the program with the provided example cases using the annotations:

1. **Input**: `0 0 0`
   - Total points: `0` (even)
   - Calculation: `(0 + 0 + 0 - max(0, 0 - 0 - 0)) // 2 = 0`
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **Input**: `0 1 1`
   - Total points: `2` (even)
   - Calculation: `(0 + 1 + 1 - max(0, 1 - 0 - 1)) // 2 = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Input**: `1 1 1`
   - Total points: `3` (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

4. **Input**: `1 1 2`
   - Total points: `4` (even)
   - Calculation: `(1 + 1 + 2 - max(0, 2 - 1 - 1)) // 2 = 2`
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Input**: `3 3 3`
   - Total points: `9` (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

6. **Input**: `3 4 5`
   - Total points: `12` (even)
   - Calculation: `(3 + 4 + 5 - max(0, 5 - 3 - 4)) // 2 = 6`
   - Output: `6` (Correct)

7. **Input**: `1 1 10`
   - Total points: `12` (even)
   - Calculation: `(1 + 1 + 10 - max(0, 10 - 1 - 1)) // 2 = 2`
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all the provided example cases and adheres to the logic described in the problem statement. It correctly identifies impossible score distributions and calculates the maximum number of draws for valid score distributions.

### Final Answer

The original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
