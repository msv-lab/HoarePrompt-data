You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order. The number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)
        
    #State: a series of `t` printed values, each being either `-1` or the calculated `result` based on the input values for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integer scores in non-decreasing order. For each test case, it prints either `-1` if the sum of the scores is odd, or a calculated value representing half the sum of the scores minus the maximum of zero or the difference between the highest score and the sum of the other two scores.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers representing the scores of three players. The program then determines the maximum number of draws that could have occurred or returns -1 if the scores are inconsistent.

Here's the program for reference:
```python
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)
```

### Logic Verification

1. **Odd Total Points Check**:
   - The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because an odd total score is impossible since each game results in an even number of points (either 0+2, 1+1, or 2+0).
   - This logic is correct as per the problem description.

2. **Calculating Maximum Draws**:
   - If the total points are even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2}
     \]
   - The formula ensures that the maximum number of draws is calculated correctly by considering the points that cannot be attributed to draws alone (i.e., points that must be attributed to wins and losses).

### Testing with Example Cases

Let's verify the program with the provided example cases:

1. **Input**: `0 0 0`
   - Total points: `0` (even)
   - Maximum draws: `0`
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **Input**: `0 1 1`
   - Total points: `2` (even)
   - Maximum draws: `1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Input**: `1 1 1`
   - Total points: `3` (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

4. **Input**: `1 1 2`
   - Total points: `4` (even)
   - Maximum draws: `2`
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Input**: `3 3 3`
   - Total points: `9` (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

6. **Input**: `3 4 5`
   - Total points: `12` (even)
   - Maximum draws: `6`
   - Output: `6` (Correct)

7. **Input**: `1 1 10`
   - Total points: `12` (even)
   - Maximum draws: `2`
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all the provided example cases and adheres to the logic described in the problem statement. It correctly identifies impossible score distributions and calculates the maximum number of draws for valid score distributions.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or identify inconsistent scores for all valid inputs.
