Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is `q`, `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`, `k` is `L[2]`, `L` is a new list of integers read from the input, `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / min(L[1], L[2])))`, `M` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` except the last one, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `cost` is `mu * w`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.**

In simple terms, the value of `cost` is now calculated as `mu * w`, where `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`. All other variables retain their previously described values and conditions.
