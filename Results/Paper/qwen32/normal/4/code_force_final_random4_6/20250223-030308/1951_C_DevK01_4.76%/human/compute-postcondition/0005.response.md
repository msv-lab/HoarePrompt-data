Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is `L[0]`, `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`, `k` is `L[2]`, and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `M` is a list of integers read from the input.**

In natural language: The value of `m` is updated to be the minimum of its original value (`L[1]`) and `k` (`L[2]`). All other variables remain unchanged.
