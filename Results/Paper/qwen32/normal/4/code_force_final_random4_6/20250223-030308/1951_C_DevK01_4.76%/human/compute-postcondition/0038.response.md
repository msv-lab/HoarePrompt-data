The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables or the state of the program outside of the loop. Since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement has no effect on the program or the variables.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `n` is `q - 1`. `L` is a new list of integers read from the input, `m` is `min(m, k)`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`, `M` is a new sorted list of integers read from the input, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` excluding the last element. `cost` is recalculated based on the new values of `L` and `M`. If `n * m == k`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m` and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.**
