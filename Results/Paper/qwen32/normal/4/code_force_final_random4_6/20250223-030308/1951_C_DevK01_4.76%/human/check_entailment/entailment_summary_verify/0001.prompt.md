You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a cost based on the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the sorted list of integers. The input values remain unchanged throughout the execution of each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves purchasing tickets over multiple days with constraints on the number of tickets that can be bought per day and the subsequent price increases. The goal is to find the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` (number of days, max tickets per day, and total tickets needed).
   - It also reads the list of ticket prices `M` for each day.

2. **Price Adjustment:**
   - The program sorts the list of ticket prices in ascending order to always buy tickets on the cheapest available days.
   - It calculates `m` as the minimum of `m` and `k`, which is logical because you can't buy more tickets than you need in a day.

3. **Calculating the Number of Days to Buy Tickets:**
   - It calculates `q` as the ceiling of `k / m`, which represents the number of days needed to buy all tickets, assuming `m` tickets are bought each day.

4. **Cost Calculation:**
   - If `n * m == k` (i.e., the total tickets bought exactly equals `k`), it calculates the cost as follows:
     - `m * sum(N)`: The cost of buying `m` tickets on each of the `q` days.
     - `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`: The additional cost due to price increases.
   - If `n * m != k` (i.e., the last day does not require buying `m` tickets), it calculates the cost differently:
     - `w = N.pop()`: The price on the last day.
     - `mu = k - (n - 1) * m`: The number of tickets to buy on the last day.
     - `cost = mu * w`: The cost of buying `mu` tickets on the last day.
     - It then adds the cost of buying `m` tickets on the previous days and the additional cost due to price increases.

### Issues in the Program

The program's logic for calculating the cost is flawed. Specifically, the cost calculation does not correctly account for the price increases over multiple days. Here are some issues:

- The formula used to calculate the additional cost due to price increases is incorrect. The price increases should be cumulative and not just calculated based on a simple arithmetic series.
- The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets to buy on the last day is not equal to `m`.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
