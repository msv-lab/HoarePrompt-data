To determine the output state after executing the provided Python code snippet, we need to update the value of `cost` based on the given formula and the initial conditions.

The formula to update `cost` is:
```
cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu
```

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `n` is `q - 1`.
- `L` is a new list of integers read from the input.
- `m` is `min(m, k)`.
- `k` is `L[2]`.
- `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`.
- `M` is a new sorted list of integers read from the input.
- `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` excluding the last element.
- `cost` is `mu * w`.
- `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.

We need to compute the new value of `cost` and keep all other variables as they are unless they are directly affected by the code snippet.

Let's break down the update to `cost`:
1. `m * sum(N)` - This is the product of `m` and the sum of the first `q` elements of `M` excluding the last element.
2. `m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2)` - This term involves `m` squared and a combinatorial factor.
3. `n * m * mu` - This is the product of `n`, `m`, and `mu`.

The new value of `cost` will be the old value of `cost` plus the sum of these three terms.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `n` is `q - 1`; `L` is a new list of integers read from the input; `m` is `min(m, k)`; `k` is `L[2]`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `M` is a new sorted list of integers read from the input; `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` excluding the last element; `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.**
