The code snippet `w = N.pop()` removes the last element from the list `N` and assigns it to the variable `w`. Given the initial state, `N` contains the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M`. After the `pop` operation, `N` will have one less element, and `w` will hold the value that was the last element of `N`.

The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the operation. Here, `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `L`, `q`, `M`, and `cost` are not directly altered by `N.pop()`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is `q`, `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`, `k` is `L[2]`, `L` is a new list of integers read from the input, `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / min(L[1], L[2])))`, `M` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` except the last one, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `cost` is recalculated based on the new values of `L` and `M`.**
