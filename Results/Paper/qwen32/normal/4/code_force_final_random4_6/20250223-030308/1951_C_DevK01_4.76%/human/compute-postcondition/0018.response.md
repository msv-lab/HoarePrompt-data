Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is `len(N)`, `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`, `L` is a list of integers read from the input, and `M` is a sorted list of integers read from the input. If `n * m` equals `k`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `n` is `q-1`, `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `n * m` is not equal to `k`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.**
