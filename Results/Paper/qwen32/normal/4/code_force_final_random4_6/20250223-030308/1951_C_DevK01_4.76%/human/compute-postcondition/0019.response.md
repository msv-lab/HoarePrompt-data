To determine what will be printed by the `print(cost)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and how the variables are defined based on that state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t > 0`
- `n = len(N)`
- `m = min(L[1], L[2])`
- `k = L[2]`
- `q = int(math.ceil(k / m))`
- `L` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `M` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.
- If `n * m == k`, then:
  - `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`
  - `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`
- Otherwise, `n = q - 1`, and:
  - `N` is the first `q - 1` elements of `M`
  - `n * m != k`
  - `w` is the last element of the original `N`
  - `mu = k - (n - 1) * m`
  - `cost = mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`

### Calculation Steps:
1. **Calculate `m`**: `m` is the minimum of the second and third elements of `L` (i.e., `min(L[1], L[2])`).
2. **Calculate `k`**: `k` is the third element of `L` (i.e., `L[2]`).
3. **Calculate `q`**: `q` is the ceiling of `k / m` (i.e., `int(math.ceil(k / m))`).
4. **Determine `n` and `N`**:
   - If `n * m == k`, then `n = q` and `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`.
   - Otherwise, `n = q - 1` and `N` is the first `q - 1` elements of `M`.
5. **Calculate `cost`**:
   - If `n * m == k`, then:
     - `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`
   - Otherwise:
     - `w` is the last element of `N`
     - `mu = k - (n - 1) * m`
     - `cost = mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`

### Output Explanation:
The `cost` variable is computed based on the conditions outlined above. The exact numerical value of `cost` depends on the values of `L` and `M`, which are not explicitly provided in the initial state. However, we can describe the formula used to compute `cost` based on the conditions given.

### Final Output:
Output: **cost (where cost is calculated based on the conditions and formulas provided in the initial state)**
