The code snippet provided reads an integer `t` from the input. This integer `t` typically represents the number of test cases to follow in a competitive programming scenario. The initial state includes the integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. However, the code snippet does not modify these variables; it only reads a new integer `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer; `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged.**
