The code snippet `removed_count += 1` increments the value of `removed_count` by 1. Given the initial state, `removed_count` is either 0 or 2. After the increment, `removed_count` will be either 1 or 3.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is the integer input by the user and must be greater than 0; `n`, `f`, and `k` are the three integers input by the user, where `k` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers provided by the user; `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`; `sorted_a` is the list `a` sorted in descending order. If the current element of `sorted_a` at index `i` is equal to `favorite_value`, `removed_count` was set to 2, otherwise `removed_count` was 0; `i` is the current index + 1; `removed_count` is either 1 or 3.**
