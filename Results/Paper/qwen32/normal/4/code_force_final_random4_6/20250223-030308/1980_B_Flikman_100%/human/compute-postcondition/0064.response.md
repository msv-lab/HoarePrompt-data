Output State: **`t` is the integer input by the user minus 1; `n` is the first integer input by the user in the new input; `f` is the second integer input by the user in the new input; `k` is the third integer input by the user in the new input and must be greater than 0; `a` is the new list of integers provided by the user; `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`; `sorted_a` is the list `a` sorted in descending order; `removed_count` is 1; `favorite_count` is not recalculated and thus may not reflect the new list `a`; `i` is 0; the current value of `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`.**

In simple terms, the `removed_count` has been incremented by 1, making it 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
