Postcondition: **`t` is the integer input by the user minus 1; `n` is the first integer input by the user in the new input; `f` is the second integer input by the user in the new input; `k` is the third integer input by the user in the new input; `a` is the new list of integers provided by the user; `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`; `sorted_a` is the list `a` sorted in descending order; `removed_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`; `favorite_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the entire list `sorted_a`; `i` is `k - 1`. `removed_count` is not equal to `favorite_count`. If `removed_count` is 0, it indicates that `favorite_value` does not appear in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`. Otherwise, `removed_count` is not equal to 0 and `removed_count` is the actual count of `favorite_value` in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`.**
