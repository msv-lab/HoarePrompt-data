Given the initial state provided, we need to determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0.
- `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers input by the user.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `favorite_value` is the element at the index `f - 1` in the list `a`.
- `sorted_a` is the list `a` sorted in descending order.
- `removed_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`.
- `favorite_count` is the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`.
- It is also given that `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`.

### Analysis:
The `print('YES')` statement does not involve any variables or conditions that would change its output based on the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is not dependent on the values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, `favorite_value`, `sorted_a`, `removed_count`, or `favorite_count`. It will always print `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
