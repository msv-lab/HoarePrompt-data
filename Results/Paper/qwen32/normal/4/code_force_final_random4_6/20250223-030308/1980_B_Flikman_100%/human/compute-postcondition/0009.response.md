Output State: **`t` is the integer input by the user and must be greater than 0; `n`, `f`, and `k` are the three integers input by the user, where `k` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers provided by the user; `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`; `sorted_a` is the list `a` sorted in descending order; `removed_count` is 1; the current element of `sorted_a` at index `i` is equal to `favorite_value`.**

Explanation: The value of `removed_count` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
