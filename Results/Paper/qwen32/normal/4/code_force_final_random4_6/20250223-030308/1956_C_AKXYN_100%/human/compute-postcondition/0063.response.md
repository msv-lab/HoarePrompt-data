To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the values of the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: Must be greater than or equal to 1. This variable is not used in the print statement, so it doesn't affect the output.
2. **`n`**: An input integer. This determines the size of the matrix `mat` and the range in the print statement.
3. **`mat`**: A list of `n` lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`. This variable is not used in the print statement, so it doesn't affect the output.
4. **`res`**: The sum of the series \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \cdot (2i + 1)\). This variable is not used in the print statement, so it doesn't affect the output.
5. **`i`**: Set to \(n-2\).

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

- **`'1 %d' % i`**: This part of the statement formats the string `'1 '` followed by the value of `i`. Since `i` is set to \(n-2\), this will print `'1 '` followed by the value of \(n-2\).
- **`*range(1, n + 1)`**: The `*` operator unpacks the range of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and prints them as separate arguments.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `n` is 5 for a concrete example:
- `i` will be \(5 - 2 = 3\).
- `range(1, 5 + 1)` will generate the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

### Final Output:
Combining these, the output will be:
- `'1 3'` (from `'1 %d' % i`)
- Followed by the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (from `*range(1, n + 1)`)

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **1 3 1 2 3 4 5 (where i is n-2 and n is the input integer)**

This format adheres to the requirement of providing the most precise description possible based on the given initial state.
