The loop runs from `i = n` down to `1`, decrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration. Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that `n` must be at least 3. The loop will terminate when `i` reaches 0, meaning it will run `n` times in total.

Since the output states after 1, 2, and 3 iterations show `i` taking values 2, 1, and 0 respectively, we can deduce that after all iterations, `i` will be 0. No other variables in the loop body or the initial state are modified, so their values remain the same.

Given that the loop runs `n` times and `i` starts from `n` and decrements to 1, the final value of `i` will be 0 after all iterations are completed.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 22, `i` is 0**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop are completed, the variable `i` will be 0, while all other variables (`t`, `n`, `mat`, and `res`) will remain unchanged from their initial states.
