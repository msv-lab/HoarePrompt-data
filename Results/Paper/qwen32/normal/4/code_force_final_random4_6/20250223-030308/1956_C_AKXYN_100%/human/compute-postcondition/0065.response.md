To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's first understand the loop's behavior and how it affects the variable `i`.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
    print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

The loop starts with `i` initialized to `n` and decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` is 1. Therefore, the loop will execute exactly `n` times.

Given the output states for the first 3 iterations, we can infer the general pattern:
- After 1 iteration, `i` is `n`.
- After 2 iterations, `i` is `n-1`.
- After 3 iterations, `i` is `n-2`.

Following this pattern, after `n` iterations, `i` should be `1`.

The variables `t`, `n`, `mat`, and `res` are not modified within the loop body, so their values remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations is:
- `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `mat` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`.
- `res` is the sum of the series \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \cdot (2i + 1)\).
- `i` is `1`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `mat` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of the series \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \cdot (2i + 1)\), `i` is `1`.**
