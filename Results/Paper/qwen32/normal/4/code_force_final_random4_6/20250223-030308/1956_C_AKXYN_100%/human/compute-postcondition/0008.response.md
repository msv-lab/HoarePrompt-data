The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, so for the next iteration, `i` should be 2. The condition `n > i` must hold true, which means `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 7, `i` is 2**
