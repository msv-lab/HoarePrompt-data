Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`.
- `res` is 22.
- `i` is 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **String Formatting**:
   - `'2 %d' % i`: This is a string formatting operation where `%d` is a placeholder for an integer. The value of `i` (which is 2) will replace `%d`. So, `'2 %d' % i` evaluates to `'2 2'`.

2. **Range Function**:
   - `range(1, n + 1)`: This generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
   - Since `n` is greater than 2, let's assume `n` is 3 for concreteness (the specific value of `n` greater than 2 does not affect the format of the output, just the length of the range).
   - `range(1, 3 + 1)` generates the sequence `[1, 2, 3]`.

3. **Unpacking with `*` Operator**:
   - `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the sequence `[1, 2, 3]` and passes each element as a separate argument to the `print` function.

### Putting It All Together:
- The `print` function will output the string `'2 2'` followed by the numbers `1`, `2`, and `3` (assuming `n` is 3).

### Output:
Output: **2 2 1 2 3** (where `n` is assumed to be 3 for concreteness, but the output format remains the same regardless of the exact value of `n` as long as `n > 2`)

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, the output format is generalizable to any `n > 2`:
Output: **2 2 1 2 ... n** (where `n` is the value greater than 2)
