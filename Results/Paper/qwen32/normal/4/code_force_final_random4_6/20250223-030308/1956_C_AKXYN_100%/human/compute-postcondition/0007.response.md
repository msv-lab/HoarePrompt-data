The value of `res` is updated based on the formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1, the calculation is as follows:

- `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` becomes `(1 + 1) * (2 * 1 + 1)` which simplifies to `2 * 3` or `6`.
- `res` is initially `1`, so `res += 6` makes `res` equal to `7`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mat`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 7, `i` is 1**.
