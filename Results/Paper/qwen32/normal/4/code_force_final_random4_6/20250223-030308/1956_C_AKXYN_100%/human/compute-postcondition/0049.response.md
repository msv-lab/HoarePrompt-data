The given code snippet updates the value of `res` by adding the result of the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to it. Given the initial state where `i` is 1, we can calculate the new value of `res`.

Let's calculate the new value of `res`:
- `i = 1`
- The expression to be added to `res` is `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`
- Substituting `i = 1` into the expression gives us `(1 + 1) * (2 * 1 + 1) = 2 * 3 = 6`
- Since `res` was initially 0, the new value of `res` is `0 + 6 = 6`

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mat`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `mat` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 6, `i` is 1**
