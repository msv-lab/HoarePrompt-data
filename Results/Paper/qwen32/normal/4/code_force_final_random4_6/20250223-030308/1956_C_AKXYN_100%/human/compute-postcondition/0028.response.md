The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1. The condition `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 remains unchanged since it is a prerequisite for the loop to start and does not change within the loop.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `mat` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 1, `i` is 1**
