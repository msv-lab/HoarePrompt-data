`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`t`, `mat`, `res`, `i`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 22, `i` is 0**
