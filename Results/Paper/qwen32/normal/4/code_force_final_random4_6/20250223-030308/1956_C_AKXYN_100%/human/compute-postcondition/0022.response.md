The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's state directly. However, the loop's execution depends on the value provided by `int(input())`. Since the loop head does not include any variables that we can directly adjust based on the given state, we need to infer what the next iteration's state would be based on the input.

Given that the loop will execute based on the integer input, we can assume that the input value is decremented by 1 after each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the input value must be greater than 0.

Since the state provided does not include the input value directly, we can infer that the input value must have been decremented by 1 from the previous iteration. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be the same as the previous state, except that the input value (which we don't have a direct reference to) must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 22, `i` is 0**
