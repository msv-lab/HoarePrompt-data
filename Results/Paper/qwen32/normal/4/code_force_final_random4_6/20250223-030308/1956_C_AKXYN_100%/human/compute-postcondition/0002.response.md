The code creates a matrix `mat` where each row is a list of integers from 1 to `n`. Since `n` is an input integer, the matrix will have `n` rows, each containing `n` integers in increasing order starting from 1.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`.**
