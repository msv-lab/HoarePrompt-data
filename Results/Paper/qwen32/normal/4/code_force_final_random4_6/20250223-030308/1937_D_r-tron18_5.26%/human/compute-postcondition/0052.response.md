Given the initial state and the code snippet, the variable `oneInd` is recalculated based on the provided formula. The other variables remain unchanged unless explicitly modified.

The code snippet modifies `oneInd` as follows:
```
oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
```

Since the specific definition of `func_1` is not provided, we can only express `oneInd` in terms of `func_1(preOne, zr)`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, minus one if `el` is '>', and unchanged if `el` is '<'; `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0, n - 1]` if `el` is '>', and `[0, n, 2n - 1]` if `el` is '<'; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on the conditions provided; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 2`; `el` is `s1[n - 2]` (which is either '<' or '>'); `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is `n - 1` if `el` is '>', and `3n - 1` if `el` is '<'; `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`; `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol` is greater than `zr` and `el` is '>'**
