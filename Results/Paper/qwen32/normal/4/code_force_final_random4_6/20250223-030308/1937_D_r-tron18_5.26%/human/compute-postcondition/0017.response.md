To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the impact of the given code snippet on the initial state. The code snippet is:

```python
fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
```

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Initial State Recap:**
   - `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`.
   - `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
   - `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`.
   - `suffZero` is `[0]`.
   - `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `el` is `s1[n - 1]` which is '>'.
   - `ol` is `totalOne`.
   - `zr` is `0`.
   - `zeroInd` is `0`.
   - `oneInd` is `preOne[1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The code calculates `fi` using the function `func_1` applied to `preOne` with arguments `zr + 1` and `zr`.

3. **Impact on Variables:**
   - `fi` is the only variable that is newly assigned a value in this code snippet.
   - The value of `fi` is the difference between the results of `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)` and `func_1(preOne, zr)`.

Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the initial state, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `fi`. However, we can express `fi` in terms of the function `func_1` and the variables `preOne`, `zr`, `zr + 1`.

**Output State:**
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`.
- `suffZero` is `[0]`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `el` is `s1[n - 1]` which is '>'.
- `ol` is `totalOne`.
- `zr` is `0`.
- `zeroInd` is `0`.
- `oneInd` is `preOne[1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.
- `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`, `suffZero` is `[0]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is `s1[n - 1]` which is '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `0`, `zeroInd` is `0`, `oneInd` is `preOne[1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`**.
