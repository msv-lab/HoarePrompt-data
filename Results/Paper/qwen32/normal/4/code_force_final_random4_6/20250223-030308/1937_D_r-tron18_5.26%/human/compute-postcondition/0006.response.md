The code snippet assigns the value of `s1[i]` to a new variable `el`. Given that `i` is `n - 1`, `el` will hold the last character of the string `s1`.

Since `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `el` will be either '<' or '>'.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`, `suffZero` is `[0]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is `s1[n - 1]` (which is either '<' or '>').**
