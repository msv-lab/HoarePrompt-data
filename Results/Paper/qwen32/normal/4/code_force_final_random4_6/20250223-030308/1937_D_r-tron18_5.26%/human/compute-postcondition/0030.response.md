To solve this, we need to understand the impact of the given line of code on the variables and the overall state. The line of code is:

```python
zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
```

Given the initial state, we know the following:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`.
- `suffZero` is `[0, n]`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `el` is `s1[n - 1]` (which is either '<' or '>'), and `el` is not '>'.
- `ol` is `totalOne`.
- `zr` is `1`, and `zr` is greater than `ol`.

The line of code involves a function call `func_1` which is not defined in the given context. However, we can assume that `func_1` takes two arguments, a list and an integer, and returns some value based on these inputs.

Since `suffZero` is `[0, n]`, and `ol` is the number of '>' characters, let's consider the possible values of `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` and `func_1(suffZero, 1)`:
- `func_1(suffZero, 1)` will return the value at index 1 of `suffZero` which is `n`.
- `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` will return the value at index `ol + 1` of `suffZero`. Since `suffZero` is `[0, n]`, if `ol + 1` is greater than 1, it will be out of bounds, but since `ol` is the number of '>' characters and `zr` (which is 1) is greater than `ol`, `ol` must be 0. Therefore, `ol + 1` is 1, and `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` will also return `n`.

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
```python
zeroInd = 2 * n - n = n
```

The variables `s1`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `n`, `i`, `el`, `ol`, and `zr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`, `suffZero` is `[0, n]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is `s1[n - 1]` (which is either '<' or '>'), and `el` is not '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `1`, and `zr` is greater than `ol`, `zeroInd` is `n`.**
