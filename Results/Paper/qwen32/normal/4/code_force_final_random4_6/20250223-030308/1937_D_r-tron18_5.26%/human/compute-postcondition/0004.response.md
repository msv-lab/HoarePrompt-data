The code snippet initializes a list `ans` with `n` zeros. This means that the length of `ans` is the same as the length of the string `s1`, and all its elements are set to `0`. 

The other variables (`s1`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`, `suffZero` is `[0]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.**
