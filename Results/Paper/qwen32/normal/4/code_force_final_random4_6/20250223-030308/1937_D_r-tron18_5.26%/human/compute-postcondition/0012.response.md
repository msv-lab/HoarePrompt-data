The code snippet assigns the value of `zeroInd - oneInd` to `ans[i]`. Given the initial state, we can determine the new value of `ans[i]` while keeping other variables unchanged.

Initial State:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`.
- `suffZero` is `[0]`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `el` is `s1[n - 1]` which is '>'.
- `ol` is `0`.
- `zr` is `0`.
- `zeroInd` is `0`.
- `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.

The code snippet:
```
ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
```

Given that `zeroInd` is `0` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`, the expression `zeroInd - oneInd` simplifies to `- (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`; `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`; `suffZero` is `[0]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is `- (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 1`; `el` is `s1[n - 1]` which is '>'; `ol` is `0`; `zr` is `0`; `zeroInd` is `0`; `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.**

In natural language: The value of `ans[n-1]` has been updated to `- (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`. All other variables retain their initial values.
