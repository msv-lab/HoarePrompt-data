The given code snippet creates a list `pre` that contains the indices (1-based) of all occurrences of the character '>' in the string `s1`. The length of the string `s1` is `n`.

To determine the output state, we need to understand that `pre` will be a list of integers where each integer is the position (1-based index) of a '>' character in `s1`.

For example, if `s1` is "<><>>", then `pre` would be `[2, 4, 5]` because '>' appears at the 2nd, 4th, and 5th positions in the string.

Since the exact string `s1` is not provided, we can only describe the transformation of `pre` in terms of `s1`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`.**
