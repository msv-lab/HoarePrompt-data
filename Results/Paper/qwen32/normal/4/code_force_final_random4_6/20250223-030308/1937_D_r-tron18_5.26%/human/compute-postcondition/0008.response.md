The code snippet assigns the value of `totalOne` to the variable `ol` and the value of `len(suffZero) - 1` to the variable `zr`. Since `suffZero` is initially `[0]`, `len(suffZero)` is `1`, and thus `zr` is assigned the value `0`.

The other variables (`s1`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `n`, `i`, `el`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`, `suffZero` is `[0]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is `s1[n - 1]` which is '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `0`.**
