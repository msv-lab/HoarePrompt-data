To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the given code snippet on the variables. The code snippet modifies the `zeroInd` variable based on the function call `func_1(suffZero, ol)`.

Given:
- `zeroInd` is initially `0` if `el` is '>', and `n` if `el` is '<'.
- `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', and `[0, n]` if `el` is '<'.
- `ol` is `totalOne`.

The code snippet modifies `zeroInd` as follows:
- `zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`

Since the value of `func_1(suffZero, ol)` is not provided, we'll denote it as `func_1(suffZero, ol) = x` for the sake of explanation. Therefore, `zeroInd` becomes `2 * x`.

Now, we need to consider the two cases for `el`:

### Case 1: `el` is '>'
- `suffZero = [0]`
- `zeroInd` is initially `0`
- `zeroInd = 2 * func_1([0], ol)`

### Case 2: `el` is '<'
- `suffZero = [0, n]`
- `zeroInd` is initially `n`
- `zeroInd = 2 * func_1([0, n], ol)`

Since the exact value of `func_1(suffZero, ol)` is not provided, we will represent the final value of `zeroInd` in terms of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`.

### Output State:
- If `el` is '>', `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1([0], ol)`.
- If `el` is '<', `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1([0, n], ol)`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, minus one if `el` is '>', and unchanged if `el` is '<'; `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', and `[0, n]` if `el` is '<'; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on the conditions provided; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 2`; `el` is `s1[n - 2]` (which is either '<' or '>'); `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', and `1` if `el` is '<'; `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1([0], ol)` if `el` is '>', and `2 * func_1([0, n], ol)` if `el` is '<'; `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` if `ol` is less than or equal to `zr` and `el` is '>', otherwise `preOne[1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. If `el` is '<', `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, otherwise `2 * totalOne`; `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol` is greater than `zr` and `el` is '>'**.
