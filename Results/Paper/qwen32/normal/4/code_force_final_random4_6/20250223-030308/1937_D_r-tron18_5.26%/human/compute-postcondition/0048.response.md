Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, minus one; `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`, with the last element removed; `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', and `[0, n]` if `el` is '<'; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on the conditions provided; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 2`; `el` is `s1[n - 2]` (which is either '<' or '>'); `ol` is `totalOne` (updated to be `totalOne - 1`); `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', and `1` if `el` is '<'; `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1([0], ol)` if `el` is '>', and `2 * func_1([0, n], ol)` if `el` is '<'; `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` if `ol <= zr` and `el` is '>', otherwise `preOne[1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. If `el` is '<', `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` if `zr <= ol`, otherwise `2 * totalOne`; `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol` is greater than `zr` and `el` is '>'. If `ol <= zr`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `totalOne` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
