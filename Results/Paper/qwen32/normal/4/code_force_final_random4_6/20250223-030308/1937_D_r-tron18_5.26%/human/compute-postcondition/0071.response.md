The code snippet provided is `preOne.pop()`, which removes the last element from the list `preOne`.

Given the initial state:
- `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is `'>`.

After executing `preOne.pop()`, the last element of `preOne` is removed. This means that the length of `preOne` is reduced by 1, and the last cumulative sum is no longer included.

The other variables (`s1`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `n`, `i`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, minus one if `el` is '>', and unchanged if `el` is '<'; `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>', and now the last element has been popped; `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', `[0, n]` if `el` is '<', `[0, n - 1]` if `el` is '>' and there is an else part, and `[0, n, 2n - 1]` if `el` is '<' and there is an else part; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on the conditions provided; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 3`; `el` is `s1[n - 3]` (which is either '<' or '>'); `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.**
