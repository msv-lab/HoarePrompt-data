Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`, `suffZero` is `[0]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    el = s1[i]
    if el == '>':
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if ol <= zr:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
            oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
            oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
            fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
        preOne.pop()
        totalOne -= 1
    else:
        suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if zr <= ol:
            zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
            oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`. `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, minus one if `el` is '>', and unchanged if `el` is '<'. `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'. `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', and `[0, n]` if `el` is '<'. `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on the conditions: if `el` is '>' and `ol` (which is `totalOne`) is less than or equal to `zr` (which is `0`), then `ans[n-1]` is `- (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`; otherwise, `ans[n-1]` is `-preOne[1] + n + 1`. If `el` is '<' and `zr` (which is `1`) is less than or equal to `ol`, then `ans[n-1]` is `n - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + n + 1`; otherwise, `ans[n-1]` is `n - 2 * totalOne`. `n` is greater than 0. `i` is `n - 1`. `el` is `s1[n - 1]` (which is either '<' or '>'). `ol` is `totalOne` minus one if `el` is '>', otherwise `totalOne`. `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', and `1` if `el` is '<'. `zeroInd` is `0` if `el` is '>', and `n` if `el` is '<'. `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` if `ol` is less than or equal to `zr` and `el` is '>', otherwise `preOne[1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. If `el` is '<', `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, otherwise `2 * totalOne`. `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol` is greater than `zr` and `el` is '>'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, minus one if `el` is '>', and unchanged if `el` is '<'; `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', `[0, n]` if `el` is '<', `[0, n - 1]` if `el` is '>' and there is an else part, and `[0, n, 2n - 1]` if `el` is '<' and there is an else part; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on the conditions provided; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 2`; `el` is `s1[n - 2]` (which is either '<' or '>'); `ol` is `totalOne` minus one if `el` is '>', otherwise `totalOne`; `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', and `1` if `el` is '<'; `zeroInd` is `0` if `el` is '>', and `2 * func_1([0, n], ol)` if `el` is '<'; `oneInd` is calculated differently based on conditions involving `ol` and `zr`; `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol` is greater than `zr` and `el` is '>'. If `el` is '>', `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd` if `ol <= zr`, otherwise `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. If `el` is '<', `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd` if `zr <= ol`, otherwise `zeroInd - oneInd` with `zeroInd` and `oneInd` calculated differently based on conditions involving `suffZero` and `preOne`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, minus two if `el` is '>', minus one if `el` is '<', and unchanged if `el` is '<' and there is no else part; `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', `[0, n]` if `el` is '<', `[0, n - 1]` if `el` is '>' and there is an else part, and `[0, n, 2n - 1]` if `el` is '<' and there is an else part; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on the conditions provided; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 3`; `el` is `s1[n - 3]` (which is either '<' or '>'); `ol` is `totalOne` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1` if `el` is '>', and `1` if `el` is '<'; `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated based on conditions involving `suffZero`, `preOne`, `ol`, and `zr`; `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` if `el` is '>' and `ol > zr`, otherwise `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
