Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem using a combination of preprocessing and accumulation techniques to efficiently compute the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position. However, the implementation in `func_2` seems to have logical errors and does not correctly simulate the pinball movement and inversion of characters as described in the problem statement.

Here are the key issues with the provided program:

1. **Inversion of Characters**: The problem specifies that after the pinball moves from a cell, the character in that cell is inverted. The provided program does not account for this inversion in its calculations, which would significantly affect the movement of the pinball in subsequent steps.

2. **Accumulation and Indexing**: The use of `accumulate` and the calculations in `func_1` and `func_2` are not straightforward and do not directly correspond to simulating the pinball movement and inversion. The logic for determining `zeroInd` and `oneInd` and their usage in calculating `ans[i]` appears to be incorrect without a clear explanation of how it models the pinball movement and inversion.

3. **Complexity and Correctness**: While the program tries to optimize the solution using accumulation, the overall approach seems overly complex and does not align with a correct simulation of the pinball movement and inversion. A simpler and more intuitive approach would involve directly simulating the movement of the pinball for each starting position while keeping track of the character inversions.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
