Let's break down the provided code snippet and determine the impact on the variables:

```
ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
```

Given the initial state:

- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`.
- `suffZero` is `[0]`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `el` is `s1[n - 1]` which is '>'.
- `ol` is `totalOne`.
- `zr` is `0`.
- `zeroInd` is `0`.
- `oneInd` is `preOne[1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.
- `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`.

Let's evaluate the expression `ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`:

- `zeroInd` is `0`.
- `oneInd` is `preOne[1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`.

Since `zr` is `0`, `fi` simplifies to `func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 0)`.

The value of `ans[i]` will be:
```
ans[i] = 0 - (preOne[1] - func_1(preOne, 1)) + n + 1 - (func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 0))
```

Simplifying further:
```
ans[i] = -preOne[1] + func_1(preOne, 1) + n + 1 - func_1(preOne, 1) + func_1(preOne, 0)
ans[i] = -preOne[1] + n + 1 + func_1(preOne, 0)
```

Since `func_1(preOne, 0)` is typically `0` (as it's a cumulative sum starting from `0`), the expression further simplifies to:
```
ans[i] = -preOne[1] + n + 1
```

Thus, the output state will be:

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`; `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`; `suffZero` is `[0]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n - 1]` which is `-preOne[1] + n + 1`; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `n - 1`; `el` is `s1[n - 1]` which is '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `0`; `zeroInd` is `0`; `oneInd` is `preOne[1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`; `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`.**
