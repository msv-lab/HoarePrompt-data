The `print('Yes')` statement will output the string 'Yes'. This is a straightforward print statement that does not depend on any variables or conditions described in the initial state. The values of `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, and `q` do not affect the output of this specific print statement.

Output: **Yes**
