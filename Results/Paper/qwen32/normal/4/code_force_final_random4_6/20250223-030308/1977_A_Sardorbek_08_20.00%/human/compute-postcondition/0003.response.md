The code snippet assigns the tuple `(b, c)` to the variable `q`. The values of `a`, `i`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `b` is the first input integer, `c` is the second input integer, `q` is the tuple `(b, c)`**.
