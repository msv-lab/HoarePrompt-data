Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `b` is the first input integer.
   - `c` is the second input integer.
   - `q` is the tuple `(b, c)`.
   - `b` equals `c`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - `print('YES')`

The print statement is straightforward and simply prints the string `'YES'`. The values of the variables `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, and `q` do not affect the output of this particular print statement because the string `'YES'` is hardcoded and does not depend on any of these variables.

**Output:**
Output: **YES**
