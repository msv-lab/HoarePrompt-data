In the provided task, the for loop iterates over the range of `a`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop body is omitted, but we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the variables in the loop head.

The loop head contains:
- `i`: The loop variable.
- `a`: The number of iterations, which is given as input.

The state before the loop starts includes:
- `a`: The number of test cases.
- `n` and `m` for each test case: The number of moves Nikita can make and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.

However, according to the task, we can only adjust the state of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. 

To ensure the loop executes, `a` must be at least 1 because the loop will iterate `a` times. The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be automatically initialized to 0 by the `range` function in Python.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `a` to ensure it is greater than or equal to 1. The values of `n` and `m` for each test case are not part of the loop head and therefore should not be adjusted.

State: **`a` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0**
