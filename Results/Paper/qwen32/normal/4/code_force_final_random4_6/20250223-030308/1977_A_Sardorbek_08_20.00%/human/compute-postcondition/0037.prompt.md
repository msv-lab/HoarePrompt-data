Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer `a` (1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next `a` lines contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100), where n is the number of moves Nikita can make, and m is the desired number of cubes in the tower after those moves.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    b, c = map(int, input().split())
    q = b, c
    if b == c:
        print('YES')
    elif b < c:
        print('NO')
    elif a % 2 == b % 2:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `b` is the first input integer, `c` is the second input integer, and `q` is the tuple `(b, c)`. If `b` equals `c`, no additional changes are made to `a`. If `b` is not equal to `c`, and `b` is less than `c`, no additional changes are made to `a`. If `b` is not equal to `c` and `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, then `a` has the same parity as `b` if `a % 2 == b % 2`; otherwise, `a % 2` is not equal to `b % 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `b` is the first new input integer, `c` is the second new input integer, and `q` is the tuple `(b, c)`. The value of `q` remains unchanged regardless of whether `b == c` is true or false.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `b` is the first new input integer, `c` is the second new input integer, and `q` is the tuple `(b, c)`. The values of `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, and `q` remain unchanged regardless of whether `b` equals `c` or not.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
