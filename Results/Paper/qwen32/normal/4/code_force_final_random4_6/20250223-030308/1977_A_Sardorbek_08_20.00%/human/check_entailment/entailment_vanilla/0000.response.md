Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

The problem requires us to determine if, given `n` moves and a desired number of cubes `m` in the tower, it is possible to achieve exactly `m` cubes in the tower. In each move, we can either add or remove exactly one cube from the tower. 

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial Conditions**: The tower starts with 0 cubes.
2. **Moves**: Each move can either increase or decrease the number of cubes by 1.
3. **Final Condition**: After `n` moves, the tower should have exactly `m` cubes.

From this, we can derive the following:
- If `m` is greater than `n`, it is impossible to have `m` cubes because we can only add a maximum of `n` cubes.
- If `m` is less than 0, it is impossible to have `m` cubes because we can only remove a maximum of `n` cubes, starting from 0.
- The parity (odd or even nature) of the final number of cubes `m` should match the parity of the number of moves `n` because each move changes the parity of the number of cubes. For example, if we start with 0 cubes (even), after an odd number of moves, we will have an odd number of cubes, and after an even number of moves, we will have an even number of cubes.

Now let's analyze the provided code and see if it correctly implements the above logic:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)  # This line is unnecessary and does not affect the logic.
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

- The first `if` statement checks if `b` (number of moves) equals `c` (desired number of cubes). If they are equal, it prints 'YES'. This is correct only when `n` is equal to `m` and `n` is even (since we start from 0 cubes, an even number).
- The second `elif` statement checks if `b` is less than `c`. If true, it prints 'NO'. This is incorrect because it should check if `c` is greater than `b` (more cubes than moves is impossible).
- The third `elif` statement checks the parity of `a` (number of test cases) and `b` (number of moves). This is incorrect because it should check the parity of `b` and `c`.
- The `else` statement prints 'No' which is not always correct.

The correct logic should be:
- If `m` is greater than `n`, print 'NO'.
- If `m` is less than 0, print 'NO'.
- If the parity of `n` and `m` match, print 'YES'.
- Otherwise, print 'NO'.

The provided code does not correctly implement the above logic. Specifically, it incorrectly checks the parity against the number of test cases `a` instead of the number of moves `b`.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
