The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `b` and `c`. The variables `a` and `i` are not affected by this operation. The initial state specifies that `a` must be greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 0. After the code executes, `b` and `c` will hold the integer values provided as input.

Output State: **`a` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `b` is the first input integer, `c` is the second input integer**.
