The provided `print` statement is:

```python
print('Yes')
```

The string `'Yes'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement. The initial state and the other variables (`a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, `q`) do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it is printing a fixed string.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is given as `print('Yes')`.
2. The string `'Yes'` is a literal and does not depend on any variables or conditions in the initial state.
3. Therefore, the output will be the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
