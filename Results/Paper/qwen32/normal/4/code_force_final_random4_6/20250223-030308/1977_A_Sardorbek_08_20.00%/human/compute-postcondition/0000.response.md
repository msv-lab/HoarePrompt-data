Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer `a` (1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next `a` lines contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100), where n is the number of moves Nikita can make, and m is the desired number of cubes in the tower after those moves.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the value of the first integer input, which represents the number of test cases. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.
