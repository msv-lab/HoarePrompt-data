The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `a` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `b` is the first new input integer, `c` is the second new input integer, and `q` is the tuple `(b, c)`**
