### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not solve the problem as described. The task requires calculating the maximum beauty of the array, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. However, the given program sorts the array and prints the sorted array elements, not the calculated beauty.

To achieve the correct solution, the program should:
1. Sort the array.
2. Calculate the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
3. Print the beauty for each test case.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the current implementation only sorts the array and prints the sorted elements, without calculating the beauty. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
