The code takes the input, converts it into a list of integers, sorts these integers, converts them back into strings, and then creates a map object `ar` containing these sorted string representations.

Given the initial state, `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet provided. `n` is the integer input by the user and is used to read the input values. `ar` is updated to contain the sorted string representations of the integers from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is the integer input by the user, `ar` is a map object containing the sorted string representations of integers from the input.**
