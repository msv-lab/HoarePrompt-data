Let's break down the given code and the initial state to determine the output:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. This variable represents the number of test cases or iterations, but it is not directly used in the provided code snippet.
- `n` is the new integer input by the user. This variable is not explicitly used in the provided code snippet either.
- `ar` is a map object containing the sorted string representations of integers from the input. This means `ar` is the result of applying the `str` function to each integer in some input list and then sorting these string representations.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join(ar))
```

### Analysis:
- The `ar` variable is a map object, which means it contains the string representations of integers that have been sorted.
- When we use `' '.join(ar)`, Python will concatenate all the elements of the `ar` map object into a single string, separated by spaces.
- Since `ar` contains sorted string representations of integers, the output will be a space-separated string of these sorted integers.

### Output:
The output will be a space-separated string of the sorted string representations of the integers from the input.

### Example:
If the input integers were `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]`, their string representations would be `['3', '1', '4', '1', '5', '9']`. After sorting, this list would become `['1', '1', '3', '4', '5', '9']`. Joining these with spaces would result in the string `'1 1 3 4 5 9'`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **a space-separated string of the sorted string representations of the integers from the input**
