Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The program sorts the array and prints it, but it does not calculate the maximum beauty of the array as defined in the problem statement. To find the maximum beauty, the array should be rearranged such that the absolute differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This can be achieved by arranging the array in either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing order. The beauty of the array is then the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in this sorted order.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        beauty = sum(ar[i] - ar[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)

func()
```

This program sorts the array, computes the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements, and prints the result for each test case.
