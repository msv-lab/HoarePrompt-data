Reasoning:  
The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The task is to find the maximum beauty of the array, which is the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, the array should be sorted in ascending order. However, the current program sorts the array and prints the sorted array itself, not the calculated beauty.

To correctly solve the problem, after sorting the array, we should calculate the beauty by iterating through the sorted array and summing up the differences between consecutive elements.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        beauty = sum(ar[i] - ar[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

The original program just outputs the sorted array, which is not the required output.

Correctness: **False**
