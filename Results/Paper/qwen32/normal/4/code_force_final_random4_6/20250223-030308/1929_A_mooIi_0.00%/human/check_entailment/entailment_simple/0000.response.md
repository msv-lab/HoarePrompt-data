Reasoning:  
The provided program is supposed to determine the maximum beauty of the array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, the array should be sorted in ascending order. This is because the differences between consecutive elements will be maximized when the array is sorted.

However, the provided program does not calculate the beauty of the array. Instead, it sorts the array and prints the sorted array. This does not solve the problem as stated. The program should compute the beauty after sorting the array and print that value.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect for the given problem description.

Correctness: **False**
