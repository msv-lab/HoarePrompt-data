The code snippet `n = int(input())` will change the value of `n` to the integer value input by the user. The initial state specifies that `n` is the integer input by the user, but this line of code will overwrite `n` with a new integer input. The values of `t` and `ar` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is the new integer input by the user, `ar` is a map object containing the sorted string representations of integers from the input.**
