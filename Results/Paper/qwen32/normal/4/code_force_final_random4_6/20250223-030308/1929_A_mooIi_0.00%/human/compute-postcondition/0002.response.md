The code snippet takes an input string of integers, splits it into individual components, converts them to integers, sorts them, and then converts them back to strings. The variable `ar` is assigned the result of this process.

Given the initial state, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and `n` is an input integer, the value of `t` is not affected by the code snippet. The variable `ar` is introduced and assigned the sorted list of strings derived from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a map object containing the sorted string representations of integers from the input.**
