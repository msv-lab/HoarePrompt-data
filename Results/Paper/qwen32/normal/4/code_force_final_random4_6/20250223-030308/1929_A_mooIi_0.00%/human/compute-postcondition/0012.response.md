Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and the loop has executed `t` times. For each of the `t` executions, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `ar` is a map object containing the sorted string representations of `n` integers provided in the input. The final output consists of `t` lines, each line being the space-separated sorted string representations of the integers from the corresponding input.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop are complete, the program will have printed `t` lines. Each line corresponds to one of the test cases, where the integers from that test case's input are sorted and then printed as space-separated strings. The value of `t` remains the same as it was at the beginning, indicating the total number of test cases processed.
