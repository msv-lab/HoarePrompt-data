You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ a ≤ 30, and 1 ≤ b ≤ 30.

    #State: `t` is the initial number of test cases, and `n`, `a`, `b` are the values from the last test case processed. `ans1` and `ans2` are not defined after the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the given problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (the number of yogurts), `a` (the price for one yogurt), and `b` (the price for two yogurts on promotion). The goal is to determine the minimum cost to buy exactly `n` yogurts.

The logic used in the program is as follows:
- If `n > 1`, it calculates two possible costs:
  - `ans1`: The cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price, i.e., `a * n`.
  - `ans2`: The cost if as many yogurts as possible are bought in pairs at the promotion price, and the remaining yogurt (if any) is bought at the regular price, i.e., `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.
- It then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
- If `n == 1`, it simply prints the cost of one yogurt, i.e., `a`.

### Correctness Check

Let's verify if this logic covers all potential cases and edge cases:

1. **Case 1: `n == 1`**
   - The program correctly prints `a` since there's only one yogurt to buy.
   - Example: `n = 1, a = 5, b = 9` → Output: `5`.

2. **Case 2: `n` is even**
   - The program calculates the cost if all yogurts are bought in pairs at the promotion price.
   - Example: `n = 4, a = 5, b = 11` → `ans1 = 20`, `ans2 = 22` → Output: `20`.

3. **Case 3: `n` is odd**
   - The program calculates the cost if all but one yogurt are bought in pairs at the promotion price, and the remaining yogurt is bought at the regular price.
   - Example: `n = 3, a = 5, b = 9` → `ans1 = 15`, `ans2 = 14` → Output: `14`.

4. **Case 4: `b >= 2 * a`**
   - If the promotion price is not cheaper than buying two yogurts at the regular price, the program should fall back to buying all yogurts at the regular price.
   - Example: `n = 4, a = 5, b = 11` → `ans1 = 20`, `ans2 = 22` → Output: `20`.

5. **Case 5: `b < 2 * a`**
   - If the promotion price is cheaper, the program should use the promotion as much as possible.
   - Example: `n = 3, a = 5, b = 9` → `ans1 = 15`, `ans2 = 14` → Output: `14`.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the logic and potential cases, it appears that the program correctly handles all scenarios described in the problem statement. There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause the program to produce incorrect results.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**. The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for any valid input within the given constraints.
