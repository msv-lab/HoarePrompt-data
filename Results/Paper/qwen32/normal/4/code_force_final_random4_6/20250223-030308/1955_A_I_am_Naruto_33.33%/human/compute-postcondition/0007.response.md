Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the first integer from the input and is explicitly given as 1.
- `a` is the second integer from the input.
- `b` is the third integer from the input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `a` is the second integer from the input. The exact value of `a` is not provided in the initial state, but we know it is an integer.
- The `print(a)` statement will output the value of `a`.

### Output Description:
Since the exact value of `a` is not specified, we describe the output in terms of `a`.

Output: **a (where a is the second integer from the input)**
