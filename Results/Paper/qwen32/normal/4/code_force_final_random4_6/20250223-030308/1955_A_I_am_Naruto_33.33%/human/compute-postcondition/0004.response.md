The code snippet calculates `ans2` based on the values of `b`, `n`, and `a`. Given that `ans1` is already defined as `a * n`, the calculation for `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. 

The value of `ans2` is derived from the integer division of `b * n` by 2 and the remainder of `a * n` divided by 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input and is greater than 1, `a` is the second integer from the input, `b` is the third integer from the input, `ans1` is `a * n`, `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.**
