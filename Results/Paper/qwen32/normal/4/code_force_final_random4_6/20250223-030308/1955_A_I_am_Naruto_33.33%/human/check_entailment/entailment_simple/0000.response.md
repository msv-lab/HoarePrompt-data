### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to handle multiple test cases where each test case involves determining the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts given the individual price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - **Case 1: `n > 1`**
     - `ans1` is calculated as `a * n`, which represents the total cost if each yogurt is bought individually.
     - `ans2` is calculated as `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`, which represents the total cost if yogurts are bought in pairs wherever possible, and any remaining yogurt is bought individually.
     - The program then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
   - **Case 2: `n == 1`**
     - Since only one yogurt is needed, the cost is simply `a`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case on a separate line.

### Verification with Test Cases:

Let's verify the program with the provided test cases:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `2 5 9`
  - Calculation:
    - `ans1 = 2 * 5 = 10`
    - `ans2 = 9 * 2 // 2 + 5 * 2 % 2 = 9 + 0 = 9`
    - Minimum cost: `9`
  - Output: `9` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `3 5 9`
  - Calculation:
    - `ans1 = 3 * 5 = 15`
    - `ans2 = 9 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 13 + 5 = 18`
    - Minimum cost: `15`
  - Output: `14` (Incorrect, should be `15`)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `3 5 11`
  - Calculation:
    - `ans1 = 3 * 5 = 15`
    - `ans2 = 11 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 16 + 5 = 21`
    - Minimum cost: `15`
  - Output: `15` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `4 5 11`
  - Calculation:
    - `ans1 = 4 * 5 = 20`
    - `ans2 = 11 * 4 // 2 + 5 * 4 % 2 = 22 + 0 = 22`
    - Minimum cost: `20`
  - Output: `20` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program fails to produce the correct output for the second test case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
