Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, `b` is the third integer from the input, `ans1` is `a * n`.**

In natural language: The value of `ans1` is calculated as the product of `a` and `n`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
