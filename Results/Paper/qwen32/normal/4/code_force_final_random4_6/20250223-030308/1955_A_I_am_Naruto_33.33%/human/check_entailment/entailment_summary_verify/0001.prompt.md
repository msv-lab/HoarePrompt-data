You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the given conditions. Specifically, it computes two possible values: `ans1` as `a * n` and `ans2` as `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` when `n` is greater than 1, and directly prints `a` when `n` is 1. The function prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis
Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts. There are two pricing options:
1. Buy one yogurt for `a` burles.
2. Buy two yogurts for `b` burles.

The goal is to find the minimum cost to buy exactly `n` yogurts.

### Program Analysis
The program processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b` and calculates the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts.

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Calculating Minimum Cost:**
   - If `n > 1`, the program calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1`: Cost if all yogurts are bought individually, which is `a * n`.
     - `ans2`: Cost if yogurts are bought in pairs as much as possible:
       - `b * (n // 2)`: Cost for the full pairs of yogurts.
       - `a * (n % 2)`: Cost for any remaining yogurt that cannot form a pair.
   - The program then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
   - If `n == 1`, the program simply prints `a` because buying one yogurt individually is the only option.

### Correctness Check
- **Case 1: `n > 1`**
  - The program correctly computes the cost of buying all yogurts individually (`ans1`).
  - It also correctly computes the cost of buying yogurts in pairs (`ans2`), accounting for any remaining yogurt.
  - The program then selects the minimum of these two costs, which is the optimal solution.

- **Case 2: `n == 1`**
  - The program correctly handles the case where only one yogurt is needed by simply buying it individually at price `a`.

### Example Validation
Let's validate the program with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1:** `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
  - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9`
  - Minimum cost is `9`.

- **Test Case 2:** `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 18 + 5 = 23`
  - Minimum cost is `15`.

- **Test Case 3:** `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 22 + 5 = 27`
  - Minimum cost is `15`.

- **Test Case 4:** `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
  - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 22`
  - Minimum cost is `20`.

The program produces the correct output for all test cases.

### Conclusion
The program correctly calculates the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts under the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
