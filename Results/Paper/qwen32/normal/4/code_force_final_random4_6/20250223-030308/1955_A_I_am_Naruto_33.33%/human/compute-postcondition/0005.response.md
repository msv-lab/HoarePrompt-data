To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given variables and their relationships based on the initial state provided.

### Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (This variable is not directly used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this specific task.)
- `n` is the first integer from the input and is greater than 1.
- `a` is the second integer from the input.
- `b` is the third integer from the input.
- `ans1` is calculated as `a * n`.
- `ans2` is calculated as `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.

### Calculation:
1. **ans1**: This is simply the product of `a` and `n`.
2. **ans2**: This is calculated in two parts:
   - `b * n // 2`: This is the integer division of `b * n` by 2.
   - `a * n % 2`: This is the remainder when `a * n` is divided by 2.

Therefore, `ans2` can be described as the integer division of `b * n` by 2 plus the remainder when `a * n` is divided by 2.

### Output:
The `print(min(ans1, ans2))` statement will print the smaller of the two values: `ans1` and `ans2`.

Given the initial state, we can describe the output as follows:
- `ans1` is `a * n`.
- `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.

The output will be the minimum of these two calculated values.

Output: **min(a * n, b * n // 2 + a * n % 2)**
