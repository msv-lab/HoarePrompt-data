The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and conditions for `ans1` and `ans2` are defined based on the value of `n`. However, since the code only reads the input and does not perform any calculations or define `ans1` and `ans2`, these conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, `b` is the third integer from the input. If `n` > 1, then `ans1` is `a * n` and `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. Otherwise, `ans1` and `ans2` are not defined.**
