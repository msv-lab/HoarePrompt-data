The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are input integers, and there's a condition for a subsequent loop that the next input value must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again. However, this condition is not directly relevant to the current code snippet, which only assigns values to `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer.**
