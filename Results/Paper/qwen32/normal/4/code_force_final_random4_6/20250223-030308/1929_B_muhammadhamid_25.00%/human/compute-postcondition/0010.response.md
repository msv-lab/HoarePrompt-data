Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input. If `k` is 1, its value remains 1. Otherwise, the value of `k` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `k` is less than or equal to 2 times `n`, then `k` satisfies `k <= 2 * n`. If `k` is greater than 2 times `n`, then `k` satisfies `k > 2 * n`.**
