The `continue` statement in Python does not change the values of any variables; it merely skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration. Given that the `continue` statement is provided without a loop context, it implies that the loop and its conditions are already established and understood.

Since the `continue` statement does not alter the values of `n` or `k`, and the loop's continuation condition is based on the next input value being greater than 0, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, and the next input value must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.**
