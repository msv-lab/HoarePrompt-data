Postcondition: **`a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `t`, `n` (must be greater than 0), `k`, and a list of `n` integers; `x` is the Cowdeforces rating of the cow at index `k`; `i` is 0. If the current value of the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `a` is greater than `x`, then `ind` is `[0]` and `c` is 1. Otherwise, `ind` remains an empty list and `c` remains 0.**
