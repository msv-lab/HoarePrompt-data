The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `ind`. The initial state mentions that `a` is a list of tuples containing specific details about test cases, cows, and their ratings. The variable `x` is defined as the Cowdeforces rating of the cow at index `k` in the list of ratings.

The code does not modify `a`, `x`, `t`, `n`, `k`, or any other variables mentioned in the initial state. It only creates a new list `ind` which is initially empty.

Output State: **`a` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5) representing the number of cows, an integer `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`) representing your cow's index, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows; `x` is the Cowdeforces rating of the cow at index `k` in the list of ratings; `ind` is an empty list.**
