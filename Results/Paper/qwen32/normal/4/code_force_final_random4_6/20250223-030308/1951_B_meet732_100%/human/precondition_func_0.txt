a is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of cows, an integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ n) representing your cow's index, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. It is guaranteed that the a_i's are pairwise different, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
