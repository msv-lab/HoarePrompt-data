Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `a`, where each tuple contains the number of test cases `t`, the number of cows `n`, the index of your cow `k`, and a list of Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The function returns different values based on specific conditions:**

- **Case_1:** If the loop terminates at index `n` or when `c` becomes 2, it returns `n - 1`.
- **Case_2:** It returns `k - 1`.
- **Case_3:** It returns the first element of `ind` minus 1, where the first element of `ind` is not 0 and is greater than `k`.
- **Case_4:** It returns the maximum of `(k - ind[0])` and `(ind[0] - 1)`, where `ind[0]` is a non-zero index less than or equal to `k` and `c` is 1.
- **Case_5:** It returns the minimum of `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`.
- **Case_6:** It returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`, where `ind` is a list of two indices of cows with ratings greater than `x`, `ind[0]` is not equal to 0, and `k` is greater than `ind[1]`.
- **Case_7:** It returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.
