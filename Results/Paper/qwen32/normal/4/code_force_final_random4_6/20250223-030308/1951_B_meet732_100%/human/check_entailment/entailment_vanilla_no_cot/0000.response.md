Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are a few issues with the given program:

1. The function `func_1` does not take the parameter `n`, which is used inside the function. This will result in a `NameError` because `n` is not defined within the scope of `func_1`.

2. The logic for determining the maximum number of wins is flawed. The current implementation does not account for the optimal swap condition where the cow `k` can be swapped with another cow to maximize its wins. The algorithm should consider:
   - The number of cows with a higher rating than cow `k` in the initial positions.
   - The positions of these cows and how swapping can potentially increase the number of wins for cow `k`.

3. The function does not handle the case where cow `k` is already in the best possible position to win the maximum number of matches without a swap.

4. The function does not consider the possibility of swapping cow `k` with any other cow to maximize its wins, which is a key part of the problem.

A correct solution would involve:
- Simulating the matches without any swap to determine the number of wins cow `k` can achieve.
- Considering all possible swaps of cow `k` with other cows and simulating the matches to find the maximum number of wins.
- Returning the maximum number of wins between the no-swap scenario and all possible swap scenarios.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect and needs to be revised to correctly solve the problem.
