Output State: **`a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `t`, `n` (must be greater than 0), `k`, and a list of `n` integers; `x` is the Cowdeforces rating of the cow at index `k`; `i` is 2; `ind` remains [1, 2] if the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `a` was initially greater than `x`, or [1] if `ind` was initially [1, 2] but the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `a` is not greater than `x`, or an empty list if `ind` was initially empty or the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `a` is not greater than `x`; `c` remains 2 if it was initially 2 and the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `a` is greater than `x`, or 0 or 1 based on its initial value and the comparison with `x`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
