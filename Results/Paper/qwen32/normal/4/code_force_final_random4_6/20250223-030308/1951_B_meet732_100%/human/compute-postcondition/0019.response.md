The variable `c` is incremented by 1. The initial state does not specify a value for `c`, so we can only say that `c` is now `c + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `t`, `n` (must be greater than 0), `k`, and a list of `n` integers; `x` is the Cowdeforces rating of the cow at index `k`; `i` is 2; `ind` is either an empty list or [1] with 2 appended to it; `c` is `c + 1`.**
