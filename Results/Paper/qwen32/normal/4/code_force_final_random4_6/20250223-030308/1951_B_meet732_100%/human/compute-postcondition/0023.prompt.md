Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5) representing the number of cows, an integer `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`) representing your cow's index, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows; `x` is the Cowdeforces rating of the cow at index `k` in the list of ratings; `ind` is an empty list; `c` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] > x:
        ind.append(i)
        c += 1
    if c == 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `t`, `n` (must be greater than 0), `k`, and a list of `n` integers; `x` is the Cowdeforces rating of the cow at index `k`; `i` is 0; `ind` remains an empty list. If `c` was 2, `c` remains 2. Otherwise, `c` remains 0. The current value of the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `a` is not greater than `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `t`, `n` (must be greater than 0), `k`, and a list of `n` integers; `x` is the Cowdeforces rating of the cow at index `k`; `i` is 1; `ind` remains an empty list if the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `a` is not greater than `x`, otherwise `ind` is [1]; if `c` was 2, `c` remains 2 if the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `a` is not greater than `x`, otherwise `c` becomes 3. Otherwise, `c` remains 0 if the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `a` is not greater than `x`, otherwise `c` becomes 1. If `c` was 2 and the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `a` is greater than `x`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `t`, `n` (must be greater than 0), `k`, and a list of `n` integers; `x` is the Cowdeforces rating of the cow at index `k`; `i` is 2; `ind` is [1, 2] if the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `a` was initially greater than `x`, or [1] if `ind` was initially [1, 2] but the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `a` is not greater than `x`, or an empty list if `ind` was initially empty or the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `a` is not greater than `x`; `c` remains 2 if it was initially 2 and the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `a` is greater than `x`, or 0 or 1 based on its initial value and the comparison with `x`. If `c` was initially 2 and the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `a` is greater than `x`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `c` retains its initial value and `ind` is adjusted based on the comparison with `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
