Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of dimensions `n` by `m` filled with characters 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, it determines if the grid meets a specific condition: it prints 'NO' if the first row is uniform (all characters are the same) and different from the last row, or if the first column is uniform and different from the last column. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.**
