The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the newest input string in `a` to `last_row`. Given the initial state, `last_row` is already the last character of the newly appended string in `a`. After the execution of the code, `last_row` will be the concatenation of its current value and the last character of the newest input string in `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing three elements (the original string, the newly appended string, and the newest input string), `first_row` is the concatenation of the original first character of the string in `a`, the first character of the newly appended string in `a`, and the first character of the newest input string in `a`, `last_row` is the concatenation of the last character of the newly appended string in `a` and the last character of the newest input string in `a`, `i` is 0.**
