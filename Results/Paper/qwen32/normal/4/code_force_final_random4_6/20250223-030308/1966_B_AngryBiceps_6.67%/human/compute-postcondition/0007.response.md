The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last string in the list `a` to the `first_row` string. Given that `a` is a list containing one input string, `a[-1]` refers to that single string, and `a[-1][0]` is the first character of that string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing one input string, `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a`, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is 0.**

In natural language: The variable `first_row` now holds the first character of the string contained in the list `a`. All other variables retain their initial values.
