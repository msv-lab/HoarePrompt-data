The `print('YES')` statement in the provided code snippet is independent of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, `last_row`, and `i`. The print statement is a simple output statement that will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Here's the breakdown of the given initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.
- `a` is a list containing `n` input strings.
- `first_row` is a string containing the first characters of each of the `n` strings in `a` concatenated together.
- `last_row` is a string containing the last characters of each of the `n` strings in `a` concatenated together.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- Additional conditions about the uniqueness of characters in `a[0]` and the equality of `first_row` and `last_row` are provided, but these do not affect the print statement.

Since the print statement is simply `print('YES')`, the output will be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
