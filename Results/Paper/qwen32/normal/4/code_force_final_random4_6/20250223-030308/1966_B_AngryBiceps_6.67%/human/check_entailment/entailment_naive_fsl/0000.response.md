Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it only checks if the first row and the last row are the same or if the first column and the last column are the same. This is not sufficient to determine if the entire grid can be made the same color.

Consider the following counterexample:

Input:
```
1
3 3
BWB
WBB
BWB
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

Explanation:
In this case, no matter which two squares of the same color you choose to perform the operation on, you cannot make the entire grid the same color. The program, however, would output "YES" for this input because the first and last rows are not the same and the first and last columns are not the same, but it does not correctly determine that it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
