Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem asks if it is possible to make all squares in a grid the same color using specific operations. The operations allow us to select any two squares of the same color and then color all squares in the subrectangle defined by those two squares to that color.

### Key Observations
- If the grid can be made entirely one color, then the grid must be such that it's possible to "spread" one color to cover the entire grid.
- The operations allow us to "fill" a rectangle with the same color. This means we need to check if there's a way to connect all the same-colored squares in such a way that the entire grid can be filled with that color.
- A simple observation is that if the first row and the last row have the same color and are consistent in their pattern, then the grid can likely be filled with that color. However, this is not a sufficient condition alone.
- Another important observation is that if there is a single color that appears in every row and every column, then the entire grid can be filled with that color.

### Code Analysis
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by checking two conditions:
1. If the first row is uniform (all the same color) and the first row is not the same as the last row.
2. If the first column is uniform (all the same color) and the first column is not the same as the last column.

However, these conditions are not sufficient to determine if the entire grid can be filled with one color. The code does not account for the possibility that a single color might appear in every row and column, which would allow the entire grid to be filled with that color.

### Counterexample
Consider the following grid:
```
2 2
BB
BB
```
The code would output "YES" because the first row and the last row are the same and uniform. This is correct.

However, consider another grid:
```
2 2
BW
WB
```
The code would output "NO" because the first row is not the same as the last row. This is incorrect because we can still fill the entire grid with one color by selecting appropriate pairs of squares.

### Conclusion
The code does not correctly handle all cases and therefore is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
