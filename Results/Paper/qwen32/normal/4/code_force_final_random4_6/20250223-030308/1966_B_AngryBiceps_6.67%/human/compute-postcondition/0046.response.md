The `print('NO')` statement in the given code snippet is a simple print statement that outputs the string 'NO' regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, `last_row`, and `i`.

Here is the breakdown of the given information:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.
- `a` is a list containing `n` elements, where each element is an input string.
- `first_row` is the concatenation of the first characters of each string in `a`.
- `last_row` is the concatenation of the last characters of each string in `a`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- The first string in `a` consists of identical characters.
- The first string in `a` is not the same as the last string in `a`.

Despite these details, the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables. It simply outputs the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
