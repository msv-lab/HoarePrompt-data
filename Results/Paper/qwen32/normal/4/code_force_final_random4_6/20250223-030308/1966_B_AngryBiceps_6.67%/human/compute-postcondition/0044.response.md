Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is an input string), `first_row` is the concatenation of the first characters of each string in `a`, `last_row` is the concatenation of the last characters of each string in `a`, `i` is `n-1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all `n` iterations:
- `t` remains unchanged as an integer between 1 and 10,000.
- `n` remains the same, indicating how many strings were input.
- `m` remains the second integer from the input and is not affected by the loop.
- `a` is a list containing all `n` input strings.
- `first_row` is a string made by taking the first character of each input string and concatenating them in order.
- `last_row` is a string made by taking the last character of each input string and concatenating them in order.
- `i` is set to `n-1`, which is the last index of the list `a`.
