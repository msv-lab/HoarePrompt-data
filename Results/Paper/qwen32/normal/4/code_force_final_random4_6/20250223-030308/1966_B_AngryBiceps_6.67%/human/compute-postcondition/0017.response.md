Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings, `first_row` is a string containing the first characters of each of the `n` strings in `a` concatenated together, `last_row` is a string containing the last characters of each of the `n` strings in `a` concatenated together, `i` is `n-1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations:
- `t` remains the same integer within the specified range.
- `n` remains the same integer indicating the total number of strings to be processed.
- `m` remains the second integer from the input and is not used in the loop.
- `a` is a list that contains all `n` input strings.
- `first_row` is a string formed by concatenating the first character of each string in `a`.
- `last_row` is a string formed by concatenating the last character of each string in `a`.
- `i` is the index of the last iteration, which is `n-1`.
