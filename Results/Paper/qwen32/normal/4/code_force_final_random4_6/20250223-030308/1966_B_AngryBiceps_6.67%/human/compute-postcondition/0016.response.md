The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last string in the list `a` to the variable `last_row`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `m` is the second integer from the input
- `a` is a list containing three input strings
- `first_row` is the first character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the first character of the last string in `a` and then concatenated with the first character of the last string in `a` again
- `last_row` is the last character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the last character of the last string in `a`
- `i` is 2

After executing the code snippet, `last_row` will be updated to include the last character of the last string in `a` again.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing three input strings, `first_row` is the first character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the first character of the last string in `a` and then concatenated with the first character of the last string in `a` again, `last_row` is the last character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the last character of the last string in `a` and then concatenated with the last character of the last string in `a` again, `i` is 2.**
