Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `min(n, k_initial)`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `b` is updated `i` times based on `p[b] - 1`, `s` is updated `i` times based on `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `k` is `max(0, k_initial - i)`, `bm` is the accumulated value after `i` iterations, `sm` is the accumulated value after `i` iterations, `bp` is the accumulated value of `a[b]` after `i` iterations, `sp` is the accumulated value of `a[s]` after `i` iterations. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` is greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.**
