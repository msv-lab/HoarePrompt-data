Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Summary:
- We are given a permutation `p` and an array `a`.
- Two players, Bodya and Sasha, start at positions `P_B` and `P_S` in the permutation `p`.
- Each player's score increases by the value at their current position in array `a` on each turn.
- Each player can either stay at their current position or move to the position indicated by the permutation `p`.
- The game lasts for `k` turns, and the player with the higher score at the end wins. If the scores are equal, it's a draw.

### Key Observations:
1. **Optimal Strategy**: The optimal strategy for each player is to always move to the position that maximizes their score gain. However, the problem doesn't explicitly require this optimization; rather, it seems to assume that both players play optimally without requiring an explicit strategy implementation.
2. **Score Calculation**: We need to calculate the scores for both players after `k` turns based on their movements.
3. **Cycle Detection**: The permutation `p` can form cycles. Once a player enters a cycle, their movements will repeat. We need to account for this to avoid unnecessary calculations.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`.
   - It adjusts `P_B` and `P_S` to be zero-indexed.

2. **Score Calculation**:
   - It initializes `bp` and `sp` with the values at `P_B` and `P_S` in array `a`.
   - It calculates the initial scores `bm` and `sm` by multiplying the initial values by `k`.

3. **Simulation Loop**:
   - The loop runs `k` times, updating the positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation `p`.
   - It updates the scores `bm` and `sm` by adding the values at the new positions.
   - The loop breaks once `k` turns are completed.

4. **Comparison and Output**:
   - After the loop, it compares the scores `bm` and `sm` and prints the winner or "Draw" accordingly.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Score Update**: The score updates inside the loop are incorrect. The line `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` is incorrect because it doesn't properly calculate the score gain for each turn. Similarly, `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` is incorrect.
2. **Cycle Detection**: The program doesn't detect cycles in the permutation, which can lead to incorrect results if `k` is large.
3. **Initial Score Calculation**: The initial score calculation `bm = a[b] * k` and `sm = a[s] * k` is incorrect because it assumes that the players stay at their initial positions for all `k` turns, which is not the case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above. It does not correctly simulate the game according to the rules and does not handle cycles in the permutation.

**Correctness: False**
