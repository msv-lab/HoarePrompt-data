To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 1
- `k` is -1
- `b` is `p[b] - 1`
- `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`
- `p` is a list of integers from the input
- `a` is a new list of integers from the input
- `bm` is `max(0, a[b])`
- `sm` is `2 * a[s]`
- `sp` is `3 * a[s]`
- `bp` is `3 * a[b]`

The only variables that can be adjusted for the next iteration are `i` and `n`. Since `i` is incremented in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `2` (since it was `1` at the end of the previous iteration). The value of `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a new list of integers from the input, `bm` is `max(0, a[b])`, `sm` is `2 * a[s]`, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`**
