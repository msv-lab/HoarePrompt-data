Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains several logical errors that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores:**
   - The program incorrectly calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. It attempts to use `max` inappropriately to update the scores, which doesn't align with the problem's requirements.
   - Specifically, the lines `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` are incorrect. These lines do not correctly reflect the scoring mechanism described in the problem.

2. **Infinite Loop Risk:**
   - The loop `for i in range(n):` can potentially run for `n` iterations, which is not necessary and could lead to incorrect results. The loop should only run `k` times, as the game lasts for exactly `k` turns.

3. **Indexing Issues:**
   - The program correctly adjusts the indices for 0-based indexing by subtracting 1 from `b` and `s` initially. However, it incorrectly adjusts the indices inside the loop by subtracting 1 from `p[b]` and `p[s]`, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Moves:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the moves as described in the problem. It should either stay in the current position or move to the position indicated by the permutation, but the current implementation incorrectly updates the scores based on future positions.

5. **Unnecessary Variables:**
   - Variables like `sp` and `bp` are used but do not contribute to the correct calculation of the scores.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        bm = 0
        sm = 0
        for _ in range(k):
            bm += a[b]
            sm += a[s]
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

In this corrected version:
- The scores are correctly updated by adding the value of the current position `a[b]` and `a[s]` to `bm` and `sm`, respectively.
- The loop runs exactly `k` times, as required.
- The indices are correctly adjusted for 0-based indexing.
