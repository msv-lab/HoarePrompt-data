Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[p[...p[b] - 1] - 1] - 1` (nested `k` times), `s` is `p[p[...p[s] - 1] - 1] - 1` (nested `k` times), `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a new list of integers from the input, `bm` is the maximum value accumulated over `k` iterations, `sm` is the maximum value accumulated over `k` iterations, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for `k` iterations, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for `k` iterations, and `bm` is less than `sm`.**
