Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a new list of integers from the input, `bm` is `max(0, a[b])`, `sm` is `max(0, a[s])`, `sp` is `2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`**

The value of `k` is decremented by 1, so it changes from 0 to -1. All other variables remain unchanged.
