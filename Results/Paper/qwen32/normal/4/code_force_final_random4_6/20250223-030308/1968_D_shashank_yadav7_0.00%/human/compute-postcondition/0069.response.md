Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, we need to determine the new state of the variables after executing the line `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `n` is greater than 0
- `k` is 0 (the second integer from the input minus 1)
- `b` is `p[b] - 1`
- `s` is `p[s] - 1`
- `p` is a list of integers from the input
- `a` is a new list of integers from the input
- `bm` is `a[b] * 0`
- `sm` is `a[s] * 0`
- `sp` is `a[s]`
- `bp` is `a[b]`
- If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of

Since `k` is 0, the expression `a[b] * k + bp` simplifies to `0 + bp`, which is just `bp`.

The line `bm += max(bm, bp)` then becomes `bm += max(bm, bp)`. Since `bm` is initially `a[b] * 0`, which is 0, we have:
- `bm += max(0, bp)`

Given that `bp` is `a[b]`, the expression `max(0, bp)` will be `bp` if `bp` is greater than 0, or 0 if `bp` is 0 or negative. However, since `a` is a list of integers and `b` is an index derived from `p[b] - 1`, `bp` (which is `a[b]`) is an integer from the list `a`.

Therefore, `bm` will be updated to `bp` if `bp` is greater than 0, or it will remain 0 if `bp` is 0 or negative.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a new list of integers from the input, `bm` is `max(0, a[b])`, `sm` is `a[s] * 0`, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`**
