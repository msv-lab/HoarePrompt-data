Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly simulate the game described in the problem statement. Specifically, there are several issues with the logic used to calculate the scores for Bodya and Sasha.

1. **Incorrect Score Calculation**:
   - The program incorrectly calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. The scores should be incremented by `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively on each turn, but the program incorrectly updates the scores using `bm` and `sm` in a way that does not reflect the rules of the game.
   - The lines `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` do not correctly simulate the game rules. The `max` function is incorrectly used here, and the scores should simply be incremented by `a[b]` and `a[s]` on each turn.

2. **Incorrect Loop Logic**:
   - The loop logic is flawed. The loop should run exactly `k` times, but the decrement of `k` and the break condition are not correctly implemented. The loop should decrement `k` and update the positions and scores accordingly.

3. **Initialization of Scores**:
   - The initial scores `bp` and `sp` are set to `a[b]` and `a[s]`, which is correct. However, the scores `bm` and `sm` are initialized to `a[b] * k` and `a[s] * k`, which is incorrect. The scores should be initialized to `0` and then incremented by `a[b]` and `a[s]` on each turn.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        bp = 0
        sp = 0
        for _ in range(k):
            bp += a[b]
            sp += a[s]
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
        if bp > sp:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bp < sp:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version initializes the scores to `0` and correctly increments them by `a[b]` and `a[s]` on each turn. The loop runs exactly `k` times, and the positions are updated correctly based on the permutation `p`.

Since the original program does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement, the correctness is **False**.
