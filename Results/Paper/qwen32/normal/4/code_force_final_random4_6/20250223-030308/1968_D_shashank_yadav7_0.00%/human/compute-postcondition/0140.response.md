Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the input minus 3, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp) + bm`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`, `sp` is `sp + a[s]`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `bm` is updated to be the sum of its current value and the maximum of its current value and the expression `a[b] * k + bp`. All other variables retain their previous values.
