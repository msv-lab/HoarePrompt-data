The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print('Bodya')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'Bodya'`. None of the variables or objects described in the initial state (`t`, `i`, `n`, `b`, `s`, `p`, `a`, `k`, `bm`, `sm`, `bp`, `sp`) are being used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'Bodya'`.

Output: **Bodya**
