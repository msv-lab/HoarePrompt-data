Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer value obtained from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The constraints for `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b -= 1
    s -= 1
    sp = a[s]
    bp = a[b]
    bm = a[b] * k
    sm = a[s] * k
    for i in range(n):
        k -= 1
        if k == 0:
            break
        b = p[b] - 1
        s = p[s] - 1
        bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
        sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
        sp += a[s]
        bp += a[b]
    if bm > sm:
        print('Bodya')
    elif bm < sm:
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 0; `i` is the number of iterations completed (min(n, number of iterations until `k` becomes 0)); `n` is greater than 0; `k` is `n - i` if `k` did not reach 0 within `n` iterations, or 0 if `k` reached 0; `b` is updated `i` times to `p[b] - 1`; `s` is updated `i` times to `p[s] - 1`; `p`, `a` remain unchanged; `bm` is updated `i` times to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is updated `i` times to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`; `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for `i` iterations; `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for `i` iterations. After the if-else block, `bm` is either less than `sm` or greater than or equal to `sm`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `k` (which is 0), `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `b` is `p[0] - 1`, `s` is `p[0] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a new list of integers from the input, `bm` is the maximum value accumulated over `k` iterations (which is 0 since `k` is 0), `sm` is the maximum value accumulated over `k` iterations (which is 0 since `k` is 0), `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for `k` iterations (which is 0 since `k` is 0), `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for `k` iterations (which is 0 since `k` is 0). If `bm` is greater than `sm`, the condition holds; otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `min(n, k_initial)`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `b` is updated `i` times based on `p[b] - 1`, `s` is updated `i` times based on `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `k` is `max(0, k_initial - i)`, `bm` is the accumulated value after `i` iterations, `sm` is the accumulated value after `i` iterations, `bp` is the accumulated value of `a[b]` after `i` iterations, `sp` is the accumulated value of `a[s]` after `i` iterations. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` is greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
