Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a new list of integers from the input, `bm` is `max(0, a[b])`, `sm` is `max(0, a[s])`, `sp` is `2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`.**

Explanation: The value of `s` is updated to `p[s] - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
