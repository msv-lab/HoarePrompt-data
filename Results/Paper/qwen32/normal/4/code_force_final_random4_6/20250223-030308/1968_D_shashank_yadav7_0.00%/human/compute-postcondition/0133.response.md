The code snippet provided increments the value of `bp` by the value of `a[b]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the new value of `bp` will be the old value of `bp` plus `a[b]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the input minus 2, `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`, `sp` is `sp + a[s]`.**

In simpler terms, after executing the code, `bp` is increased by the value of `a[b]`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
