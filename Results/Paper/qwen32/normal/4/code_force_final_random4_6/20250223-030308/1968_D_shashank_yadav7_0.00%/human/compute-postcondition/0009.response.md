The code snippet `bm = a[b] * k` calculates the value of `bm` by multiplying the element at index `b` of the list `a` with the integer `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value obtained from the input, which must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `n`, `k`, and `s` are the four integers obtained from the input with `s` decreased by 1; `b` is the integer obtained from the input minus 1; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `a[s-1]`; `bp` is `a[b]`; `bm` is `a[b] * k`.**
