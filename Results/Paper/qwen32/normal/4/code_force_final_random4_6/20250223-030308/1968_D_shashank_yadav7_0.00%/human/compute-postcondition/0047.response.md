The given `print` statement is:

```python
print('Sasha')
```

This statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or conditions described in the initial state. The string 'Sasha' is explicitly provided to the `print` function.

Therefore, the output will be the string 'Sasha'.

Output: **Sasha**
