To determine the new state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to carefully examine how the variables are affected.

Given:
- `t` is an integer greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `k` is 0.
- `b` is `p[b] - 1`.
- `s` is `p[s] - 1`.
- `p` is a list of integers from the input.
- `a` is a new list of integers from the input.
- `bm` is `max(0, a[b])`.
- `sm` is `a[s] * 0`, which simplifies to `0`.
- `sp` is `a[s]`.
- `bp` is `a[b]`.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
```

Let's break it down:
- `sm` is initially `0`.
- `k` is `0`, so `a[s] * k` is `0`.
- `sp` is `a[s]`.
- Therefore, `a[s] * k + sp` simplifies to `0 + a[s]`, which is `a[s]`.

The expression `max(sm, a[s])` becomes `max(0, a[s])`.

Since `sm` is `0`, the `max` function will return `a[s]` if `a[s]` is greater than `0`; otherwise, it will return `0`.

Thus, `sm` will be updated to `a[s]` if `a[s]` is greater than `0`; otherwise, it will remain `0`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a new list of integers from the input, `bm` is `max(0, a[b])`, `sm` is `max(0, a[s])`, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`**.
