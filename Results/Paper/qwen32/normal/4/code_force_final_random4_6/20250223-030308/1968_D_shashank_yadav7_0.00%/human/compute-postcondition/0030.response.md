The code snippet `sp += a[s]` increments the value of `sp` by `a[s]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 0
- `k` is -1 if the initial value of `k` was 0, otherwise `k` is `k - 1`
- `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`
- `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`
- `p`, `a`, `sp`, and `bp` remain as described in the initial state
- `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`
- `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`
- `sp` is `sp + a[s]`
- `bp` is `bp + a[b]`

After executing `sp += a[s]`, the new value of `sp` is `sp + a[s]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is -1 if the initial value of `k` was 0, otherwise `k` is `k - 1`; `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`; `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`; `p`, `a`, `sp`, and `bp` remain as described in the initial state; `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`; `sp` is `sp + a[s] + a[s]`; `bp` is `bp + a[b]`.**
