To determine the final state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables evolve.

The loop starts with `cur` set to `low` and increments `cur` by 1 in each iteration until `high < cur`. The loop condition is `high >= cur`, and within the loop, there is a conditional statement that checks if `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`. If this condition is true, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks out of the loop. If the condition is false, `cur` is incremented by 1.

The loop will execute until either:
1. The condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is true, and the loop breaks, or
2. `cur` exceeds `high`, and the loop exits without breaking.

Let's analyze the output states after the first 3 iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1`.
- After 2 iterations: `cur` is either `low + 1` or `low + 2`.
- After 3 iterations: `cur` is either `low + 2` or `low + 3`.

From this, we can infer that the loop will continue to increment `cur` by 1 until either the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met, or `cur` exceeds `high`.

The final state of the loop can be one of two possibilities:
1. The loop breaks because `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is true, and it prints `p1 - cur + p3`.
2. The loop exits because `cur` exceeds `high` without the condition being met, and it prints `p3`.

Given the conditions, the final output state will be determined by whether the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met at any point during the loop execution.

Since we don't have specific values for `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, we can't determine the exact value of `cur` at which the loop breaks or exits. However, we can describe the final state based on the possible outcomes.

If the loop breaks, the output will be `p1 - cur + p3` where `cur` is the value that satisfies `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`. If the loop exits without breaking, the output will be `p3`.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **The loop prints either `p1 - cur + p3` if the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met for some `cur` between `low` and `high`, or `p3` if no such `cur` is found.**
