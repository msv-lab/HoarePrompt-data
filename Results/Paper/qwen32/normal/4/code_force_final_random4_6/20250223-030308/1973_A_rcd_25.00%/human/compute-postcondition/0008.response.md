Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- The current value of `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(p1 + p2)
```

Let's break down the information given:
1. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
2. `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`.

Since the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is at least as large as `p1 + p2`, the value of `p1 + p2` must be even. This is because an odd number minus an even number results in an odd number. Therefore, `p1 + p2` must be even to satisfy the condition that `p1 + p2 + p3` is odd.

However, the specific values of `p1` and `p2` are not provided, so we cannot determine their exact numerical values. We only know that their sum is even.

The print statement will output the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 + p2 is an even integer)**
