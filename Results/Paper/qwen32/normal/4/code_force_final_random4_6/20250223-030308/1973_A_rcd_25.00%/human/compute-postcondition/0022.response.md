Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. `cur` is either `low + 1` or `low + 2`. `high` must be at least `cur`.**

Explanation: The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. Therefore, if `cur` was previously `low`, it is now `low + 1`. If `cur` was previously `low + 1`, it is now `low + 2`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
