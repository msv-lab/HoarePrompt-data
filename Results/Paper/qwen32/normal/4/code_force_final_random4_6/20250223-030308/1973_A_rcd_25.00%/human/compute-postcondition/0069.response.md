Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 499; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `cur` is equal to `low`. Additionally, `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `high`, and `cur` remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
