Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `cur` is equal to `low`.**

Natural language: The variable `cur` has been assigned the value of `low`, which is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. All other variables retain their initial values.
