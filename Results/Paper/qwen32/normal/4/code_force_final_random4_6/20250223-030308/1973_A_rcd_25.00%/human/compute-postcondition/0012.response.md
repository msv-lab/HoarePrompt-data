To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure that the condition `high >= cur` is satisfied. Given the definitions of `cur` and `high`, let's analyze the situation:

- `cur` is initialized to `low`, where `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.

Since `cur` is set to `low`, the condition `high >= cur` will always be true because `high` is defined as the maximum of the two values, and `cur` is the minimum. Therefore, the loop will definitely execute the first time without any need to adjust the values of `cur` and `high`.

Thus, no adjustments are needed to the program state for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. `cur` is equal to `low`.**
