To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `high` and `cur`.

The `while` loop condition is `high >= cur`. For the loop to execute one more time, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.
- `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, then `cur` remains equal to `low`. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented to `low + 1` and `p1 - cur` is greater than `p2 - (p3 - cur)`.

We need to ensure that `high >= cur` for the loop to execute one more time. Since `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1`, `high` should be at least `cur`.

No other states need to be adjusted except for ensuring the relationship between `high` and `cur`.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:
- Ensure `high` is at least `cur`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1`. `high` must be at least `cur`.**
