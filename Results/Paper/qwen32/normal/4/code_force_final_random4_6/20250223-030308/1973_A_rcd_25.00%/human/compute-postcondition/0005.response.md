The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.**
