Output State: **The loop has processed all `t` input cases, each consisting of three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. For each case, the program checks if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1`. If the sum is even, the program checks if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`. If true, it prints the sum of `p1` and `p2`. Otherwise, it finds the largest possible value of `cur` such that `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` within the range defined by `low` and `high`, and prints `p1 - cur + p3`. If no such `cur` exists, it prints `p3`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the program has evaluated each set of scores and printed the appropriate result based on the conditions provided.
