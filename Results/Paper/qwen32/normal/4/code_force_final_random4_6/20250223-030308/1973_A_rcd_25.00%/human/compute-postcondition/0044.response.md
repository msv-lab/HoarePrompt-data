The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `cur` is equal to `low + 1`. Additionally, `p1 - cur` is greater than `p2 - (p3 - cur)`.
