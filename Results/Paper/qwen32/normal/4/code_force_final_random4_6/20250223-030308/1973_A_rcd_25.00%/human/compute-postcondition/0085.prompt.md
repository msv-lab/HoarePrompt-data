Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500. Each of the following `t` lines contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30, representing the scores of the three players in a non-decreasing order.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
    if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
        print(-1)
        continue
    if p3 >= p1 + p2:
        print(p1 + p2)
    else:
        low, high = min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)
        cur = low
        while high >= cur:
            if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                print(p1 - cur + p3)
                break
            else:
                cur += 1
        else:
            print(p3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the program continues without further action in the if block. Otherwise, the loop prints either `p1 - cur + p3` if the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met for some `cur` between `low` and `high`, or `p3` if no such `cur` is found.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the program continues without further action. Otherwise, the program prints either `p1 - cur + p3` if the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met for some `cur` between `low` and `high`, or `p3` if no such `cur` is found.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 499; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` >= `p1` + `p2`, the program does not specify a change in the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, or `p3`. Otherwise, the output will be `p1 - cur + p3` if the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met during the loop execution; otherwise, it will be `p3`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
