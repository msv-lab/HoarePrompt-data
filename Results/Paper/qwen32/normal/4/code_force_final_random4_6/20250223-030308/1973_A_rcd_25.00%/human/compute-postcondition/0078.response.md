The only variable in the loop head is `high` and `cur`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `high >= cur`. If `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `high` must be at least `cur`.
- The loop condition `high >= cur` must hold true for the loop to execute again.

Given that `high` must be at least `cur`, we need to ensure that after the last iteration, `high` is still greater than or equal to `cur` to allow the loop to proceed. Since the condition `high >= cur` must be satisfied, no adjustment is needed if this condition is already met from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state should remain as it is, ensuring that `high` is at least `cur`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 499; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` must be at least `cur`. If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, `cur` remains equal to `low`. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 1.**
