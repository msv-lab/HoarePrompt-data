The code snippet calculates the `low` and `high` values based on the differences between `p3` and `p1`, and `p3` and `p2`. Given that `p3` is less than `p1 + p2` and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, we can determine the output state as follows:

Since `p3` is less than both `p1` and `p2`, `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` will be negative. The `min` function will select the more negative value, and the `max` function will select the less negative value (closer to zero).

Let's denote `d1 = p3 - p1` and `d2 = p3 - p2`. Given that both `d1` and `d2` are negative, `low` will be the more negative of the two, and `high` will be the less negative of the two.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.**
