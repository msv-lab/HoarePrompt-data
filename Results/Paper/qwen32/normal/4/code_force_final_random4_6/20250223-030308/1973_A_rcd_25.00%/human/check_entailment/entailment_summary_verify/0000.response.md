### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate. We'll check the logic and verify it against the provided test cases and the problem description.

#### Problem Breakdown:
- We need to find the maximum number of draws in a series of chess games played among three players.
- The scores are given in non-decreasing order: \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).
- If the sum of the scores is odd, it's impossible to achieve those scores with the given rules, so the output should be `-1`.
- If the sum is even, we need to determine the maximum number of draws.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Sum Check**:
   - The first check is whether the sum of the scores is even. If not, it prints `-1` because it's impossible to have an odd total score with the given scoring system.
   
2. **High Score Condition**:
   - If \( p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2 \), the maximum number of draws is \( p_1 + p_2 \). This is because the highest score player could have won all games against the other two players and the remaining games could have been draws between the other two players.
   
3. **General Case**:
   - If \( p_3 < p_1 + p_2 \), the code calculates the possible number of draws by iterating through possible values of `cur` (which represents the number of games where the highest score player won against one of the other players).
   - The code uses the conditions `low` and `high` to determine the range of possible wins for the highest score player and iterates to find a valid configuration.

#### Test Case Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**: `0 0 0`
  - Sum is 0 (even), \( p_3 < p_1 + p_2 \), and the code correctly prints `0` (no games were played).
  
- **Test Case 2**: `0 1 1`
  - Sum is 2 (even), \( p_3 < p_1 + p_2 \), and the code correctly prints `1` (one draw between the second and third players).
  
- **Test Case 3**: `1 1 1`
  - Sum is 3 (odd), and the code correctly prints `-1` (impossible scores).
  
- **Test Case 4**: `1 1 2`
  - Sum is 4 (even), \( p_3 < p_1 + p_2 \), and the code correctly prints `2` (one win for the third player against each of the other two, and one draw).
  
- **Test Case 5**: `3 3 3`
  - Sum is 9 (odd), and the code correctly prints `-1` (impossible scores).
  
- **Test Case 6**: `3 4 5`
  - Sum is 12 (even), \( p_3 < p_1 + p_2 \), and the code correctly prints `6` (three wins for the third player against each of the other two, and three draws).
  
- **Test Case 7**: `1 1 10`
  - Sum is 12 (even), \( p_3 < p_1 + p_2 \), and the code correctly prints `2` (eight wins for the third player against each of the other two, and two draws).

#### Additional Test Case:
- **Test Case**: `0 2 4`
  - Sum is 6 (even), \( p_3 < p_1 + p_2 \). The code should correctly print `2` (two wins for the third player against each of the other two, and two draws).
  - The code indeed prints `2` for this case, as per the provided explanation.

Based on the analysis, the code correctly handles all the provided test cases and the additional test case. The original assessment incorrectly states that the code fails for the `0 2 4` test case, but this is not the case. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
