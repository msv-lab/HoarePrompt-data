The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a string `s` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. It then calculates and prints the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string `s`, adding 1 to the count if there are no occurrences of '0' followed by '1'.
