The code snippet `s = input()` overwrites the previous value of `s` with the new input value. The initial state specifies that `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', but after the input operation, `s` will take on whatever new value is provided by the input, which is also constrained to be a string of '0's and '1's of length between 1 and 500. The variable `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', where `s` has been updated to the new input value.**
