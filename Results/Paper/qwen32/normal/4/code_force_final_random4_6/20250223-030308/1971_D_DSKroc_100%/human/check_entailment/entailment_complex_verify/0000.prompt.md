You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and for each test case, s is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 0
        
        flag = 0
        
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        
        if flag == 0:

    #State: `t` remains unchanged as it is the number of test cases and is not modified by the loop. `s` is the input string for the current iteration, `count` is the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string `s` for the current iteration, `flag` indicates whether there is at least one occurrence of '0' followed by '1' in the string `s` for the current iteration (0 if no such pair exists, 1 if at least one exists). `q` will be equal to `t` after the loop completes, as it increments with each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a string `s` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. It then calculates and prints the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string `s`, adding 1 to the count if there are no occurrences of '0' followed by '1'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Breakdown:
The task is to determine the minimum number of contiguous substrings (pieces) a binary string can be cut into, such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program uses the following logic:
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the binary string `s`.
- It initializes `count` to 0 and `flag` to 0.
- It iterates through the string and increments `count` whenever it encounters a change in character (from '0' to '1' or '1' to '0').
- If it finds a '0' followed by a '1', it sets `flag` to 1.
- After the loop, if `flag` is still 0 (indicating no '0' followed by '1'), it prints `count + 1`. Otherwise, it prints `count`.

### Potential Issues:

1. **Counting Changes:**
   - The program correctly counts the number of transitions between '0' and '1'.
   - However, the final result should be `count + 1` regardless of the value of `flag`.

2. **Flag Usage:**
   - The `flag` is unnecessary because the number of pieces needed is always `count + 1` (each transition between '0' and '1' indicates a new piece is needed, and there is one additional piece before the first transition).
   - The condition `if flag == 0: print(count + 1)` is incorrect because it implies that if there are no '0's followed by '1's, the string is already sorted and should be counted as one piece. However, even if there are no '0's followed by '1's, there could still be a transition from '1' to '0', which would require more than one piece.

### Correctness Check:
Let's test the program with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case: `11010`**
   - Transitions: `1->0`, `0->1`, `1->0`
   - `count = 3`
   - `flag = 1` (since there is a '0' followed by a '1')
   - Output: `3` (correct)

2. **Test Case: `00000000`**
   - Transitions: None
   - `count = 0`
   - `flag = 0` (since there are no '0's followed by '1's)
   - Output: `1` (correct)

3. **Test Case: `1`**
   - Transitions: None
   - `count = 0`
   - `flag = 0`
   - Output: `1` (correct)

4. **Test Case: `10`**
   - Transitions: `1->0`
   - `count = 1`
   - `flag = 1`
   - Output: `1` (incorrect, should be `2`)

5. **Test Case: `0001111`**
   - Transitions: `0->1`
   - `count = 1`
   - `flag = 1`
   - Output: `1` (correct)

6. **Test Case: `0110`**
   - Transitions: `0->1`, `1->0`
   - `count = 2`
   - `flag = 1`
   - Output: `2` (correct)

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the case where the string starts with '1' and has a '0' later correctly. Specifically, the test case `10` should output `2`, but the program outputs `1`. This indicates that the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The program incorrectly uses a `flag` to determine whether to add an extra piece. The correct approach is to always output `count + 1`, as each transition between '0' and '1' indicates a new piece, and there is one additional piece before the first transition.
