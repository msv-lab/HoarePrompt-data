You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        flag = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)



- Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and for each test case, s is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 0
        
        flag = 0
        
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)
        
    #State: `t` remains unchanged as it is the number of test cases and is not modified by the loop. `s` is the input string for the current iteration, `count` is the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string `s` for the current iteration, `flag` indicates whether there is at least one occurrence of '0' followed by '1' in the string `s` for the current iteration (0 if no such pair exists, 1 if at least one exists). `q` will be equal to `t` after the loop completes, as it increments with each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap
The task is to determine the minimum number of contiguous substrings (pieces) a given binary string can be cut into, such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's before all '1's).

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the binary string `s`.

2. **Logic:**
   - The program initializes `count` to 0, which will count the number of transitions from '0' to '1' or '1' to '0'.
   - It also initializes `flag` to 0, which will be used to check if there exists a transition from '0' to '1'.
   - The program iterates through the string `s` from the first character to the second last character.
     - If the current character is different from the next character, it increments `count`.
     - If the current character is '0' and the next character is '1', it sets `flag` to 1.
   - After the loop:
     - If `flag` is 0 (meaning there are no '0's followed by '1's in the string), it prints `count + 1`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `count`.

### Correctness Analysis

- **Counting Transitions:**
  - The `count` variable is correctly incremented every time there is a transition from '0' to '1' or '1' to '0'. This is because such transitions indicate a point where the string needs to be cut to ensure that all '0's are before all '1's when rearranged.
  
- **Handling Sorted Strings:**
  - If there are no transitions from '0' to '1' (i.e., the string is already sorted), `flag` remains 0. In this case, the program correctly outputs `count + 1`. This is because even a sorted string needs at least one piece, and since `count` is 0 for a sorted string, `count + 1` equals 1, which is correct.
  
- **Handling Unsorted Strings:**
  - If there are transitions from '0' to '1', `flag` is set to 1. In this case, the program correctly outputs `count`. This is because the number of cuts required is equal to the number of transitions between '0' and '1'.

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange a binary string into a sorted binary string. It correctly handles both sorted and unsorted strings.
