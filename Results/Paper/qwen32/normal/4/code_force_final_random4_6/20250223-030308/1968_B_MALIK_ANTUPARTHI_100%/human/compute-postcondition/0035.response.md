The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (let's call it `i_end`), and `a` is a constant that does not change. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i_end + 1` must be less than `a`.

Given that we don't have the exact value of `i_end` from the previous iteration, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i_end + 1`. Since `i_end` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, it must have been `i - 1` in the current context. Therefore, the new value of `i` should be `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer read from input; `c` is an integer read from input; `d` is an input string; `e` is a string read from input; `j` equals `b` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking early, otherwise `j` is the value at which the loop breaks; `k` is the final value determined by the loop's logic, either set to `j + 1` when `k == c` or `j == b - 1`, or set to `j` when `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`; `i` is `i + 1`**
