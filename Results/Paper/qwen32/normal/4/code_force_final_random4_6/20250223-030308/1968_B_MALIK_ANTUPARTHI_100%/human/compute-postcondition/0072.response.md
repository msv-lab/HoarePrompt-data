Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is the first integer read from input; `c` is the second integer read from input; `d` is the new input string; `e` is the new string read from input; `j` equals `b` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise `j` is the value at which the loop breaks; `k` is the value determined by the conditions inside the loop at the point of breaking or completion; `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.**

Explanation: The variable `e` is reassigned to the new string read from the input. All other variables retain their previous values.
