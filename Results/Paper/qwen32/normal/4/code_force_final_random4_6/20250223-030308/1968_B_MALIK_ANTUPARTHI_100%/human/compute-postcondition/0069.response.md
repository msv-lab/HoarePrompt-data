The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1` from the previous iteration. The value of `a` remains unchanged.

Given that `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i + 1` must be less than `a`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is the first integer read from input; `c` is the second integer read from input; `d` is the new input string; `e` is the new string read from input; `j` equals `b` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise `j` is the value at which the loop breaks; `k` is the value determined by the conditions inside the loop at the point of breaking or completion; `i` is `i + 1`.**

Since `i` is incremented at the end of the previous iteration, we need to reflect that in the state at the start of the next iteration.
