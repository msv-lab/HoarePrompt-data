To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and understand the variables and their relationships.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
- `a` is an integer greater than 0.
- `b` is the first integer read from input.
- `c` is the second integer read from input.
- `d` is the new input string.
- `e` is the new string read from input.
- `j` equals `b` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise `j` is the value at which the loop breaks.
- `k` is the value determined by the conditions inside the loop at the point of breaking or completion.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

### Key Points:
- The value of `k` is dependent on the conditions inside a loop.
- `j` is related to the loop's completion or break condition.
- The exact values of `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and the loop's behavior are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `k`.

### Analysis:
Given the initial state, `k` is a variable whose value is determined by the loop's behavior. Since the exact loop logic and conditions are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `k`. However, we can describe `k` as the value that results from the loop's execution based on the provided conditions.

### Conclusion:
The `print(k)` statement will output the value of `k`, which is determined by the loop's behavior and the conditions inside the loop. Since the exact conditions and loop logic are not provided, we cannot specify a numerical value for `k`.

Output: **k (where k is the value determined by the conditions inside the loop at the point of breaking or completion)**
