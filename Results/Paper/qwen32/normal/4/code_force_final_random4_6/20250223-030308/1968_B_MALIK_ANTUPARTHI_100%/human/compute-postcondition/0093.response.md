To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is only `j`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `b-1` (since `range(b)` generates values from 0 up to, but not including, `b`).

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5
- `a` is an integer greater than 0
- `b` is the first integer read from input and must be greater than 0
- `c` is the second integer read from input
- `d` is the new input string
- `e` is the new string read from input
- `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1
- `j` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1

Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `i`) do not change based on the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is the first integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `c` is the second integer read from input; `d` is the new input string; `e` is the new string read from input; `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `j` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration plus 2**.

However, since `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the correct state should reflect that `j` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is the first integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `c` is the second integer read from input; `d` is the new input string; `e` is the new string read from input; `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `j` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**.
