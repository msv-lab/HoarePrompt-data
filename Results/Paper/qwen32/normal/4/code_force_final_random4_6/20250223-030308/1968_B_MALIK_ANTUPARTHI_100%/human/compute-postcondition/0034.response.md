To determine the output of the `print(k)` statement, we need to understand the logic and state of the variables involved in the loop and the conditions that affect the value of `k`.

### Variables and Conditions:
1. **t**: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (This variable seems to be related to the number of test cases but is not directly involved in the calculation of `k` for a single test case.)
2. **n** and **m**: Integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 (These variables are not directly involved in the calculation of `k` for the given snippet.)
3. **a**: An integer greater than 0 (Not directly involved in the calculation of `k` for the given snippet.)
4. **b**: An integer read from input.
5. **c**: An integer read from input.
6. **d**: An input string.
7. **e**: A string read from input.
8. **j**: Equals `b` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking early, otherwise `j` is the value at which the loop breaks.
9. **k**: Determined by the loop's logic:
   - `k` is set to `j + 1` if `k == c` or `j == b - 1`.
   - `k` is set to `j` if `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`.

### Loop Logic:
The loop logic affects the value of `j` and subsequently `k`. Since the exact loop is not provided, we can infer the following:
- The loop iterates over some range, possibly from `0` to `b-1`.
- If a certain condition is met within the loop (e.g., `d[j]` is found in `e[k:]`), the loop breaks, and `j` takes the value at which the loop breaks.
- If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `j` is set to `b`.

### Determining `k`:
- If `j` equals `b - 1` or `k` equals `c`, then `k` is set to `j + 1`.
- Otherwise, `k` is set to `j` if `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`.

### Output:
Given the conditions and the loop logic, the value of `k` depends on the specific values of `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e`. Since the exact values of `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `k`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the `print(k)` statement will output the final value of `k` determined by the loop's logic.

Output: **k (where k is the final value determined by the loop's logic, either set to j + 1 when k == c or j == b - 1, or set to j when d[j] is not found in e[k:])**
