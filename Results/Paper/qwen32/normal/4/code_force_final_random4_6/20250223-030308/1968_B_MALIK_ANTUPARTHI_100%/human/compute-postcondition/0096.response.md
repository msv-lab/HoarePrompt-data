Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is the first integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `c` is the second integer read from input; `d` is the new input string; `e` is the new string read from input; `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `j` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `k` is `j + 1`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. The code snippet provided is a `break` statement, which causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not affect the values of any variables.
