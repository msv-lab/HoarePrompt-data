The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `b`.

Given the conditions:
- `j` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.
- The loop runs while `j` is less than `b`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was incremented by 1, so for the next iteration, `j` should be incremented again.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is the first integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `c` is the second integer read from input; `d` is the new input string; `e` is the new string read from input; `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `j` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 2.**

Note: The values of `k` and the conditions related to the characters in the strings `d` and `e` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
