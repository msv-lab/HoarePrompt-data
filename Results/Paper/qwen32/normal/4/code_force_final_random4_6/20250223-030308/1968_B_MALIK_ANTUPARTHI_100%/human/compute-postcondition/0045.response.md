Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` must be at least 1, `c` is the second integer read from input, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the new string read from input, `j` is the value at which the loop breaks, `k` is `j + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `d[j]` is an element present in the substring `e[k:]`. Additionally, either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The loop breaks early, so `j` is set to the value at which the loop breaks. `k` is then set to `j + 1`, and `i` is incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` remain unchanged. The condition that either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1` still holds.
