The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the range `1, n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these for the next iteration. According to the loop, it will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. So, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented again by 1 from its current value. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the range.

The other variables `t`, `r`, `prev`, and `r2` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted in this context.

State: **`t` is some value, `n` is greater than 1, `r` is the value provided by the user, `i` is incremented by 1 (from its previous value)**

To be more specific:
- If `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it should be 3 at the start of the next iteration.
- `n` remains greater than 1.
- `r`, `prev`, and `r2` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is some value, `n` is greater than 1, `r` is the value provided by the user, `i` is incremented by 1 (specifically, if `i` was 2, now `i` is 3)**

To generalize:
State: **`t` is some value, `n` is greater than 1, `r` is the value provided by the user, `i` is incremented by 1**
