Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

Initial State:
- `t` is unchanged (not relevant to the print statement).
- `n` is greater than `i + 2` (not directly relevant to the print statement).
- `kp` is incremented by 1 (not relevant to the print statement).
- `g` is 0 (not relevant to the print statement).
- `v1` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or `0` if no `'<'` was received) (not relevant to the print statement).
- `v2` is `n - 1` (not relevant to the print statement).
- `r` is the new input string (not relevant to the print statement).
- `i` is incremented by 1 (relevant to the print statement).
- The output buffer is flushed (not relevant to the print statement).
- `prev` is set according to the conditions (relevant to the print statement).
- `r2` is set according to the conditions (not relevant to the print statement).

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` will hold the new value after the increment.
- `prev` is set according to the conditions, but we don't have the exact value of `prev` from the initial state description.

Since the print statement prints `i` twice and `prev` twice, we can describe the output in terms of the current value of `i` and the value of `prev` at the time of the print statement.

Output: **? [new value of i] [new value of i] [prev] [prev] (where [new value of i] is the value of i after it has been incremented by 1 and [prev] is the value of prev set according to the conditions)**

To make it more precise, let's assume the initial value of `i` before the increment was `x`. After the increment, `i` becomes `x + 1`. The value of `prev` is not explicitly given, but it is set according to the conditions provided in the initial state.

Output: **? [x + 1] [x + 1] [prev] [prev] (where [x + 1] is the new value of i after incrementing and [prev] is the value of prev set according to the conditions)**

Since the exact initial value of `i` (`x`) and the value of `prev` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `i` after the increment. However, we can provide the most precise description based on the given information.

Output: **? [i] [i] [prev] [prev] (where [i] is the value of i after it has been incremented by 1 and [prev] is the value of prev set according to the conditions)**
