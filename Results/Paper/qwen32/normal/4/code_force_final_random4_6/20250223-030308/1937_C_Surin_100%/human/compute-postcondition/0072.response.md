The provided Python code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This command flushes the internal buffer of the standard output, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the console immediately. It does not change the values of any variables or the state of the program in terms of variable assignments or conditions.

Therefore, the Output State remains unchanged from the Initial State.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the input `r` was `<`. If no `r` was `<`, `v1` is 0, `prev` is the last `i` for which `r` was `'>'` or `r` was `'='` and `r2` was `'<'`.**
