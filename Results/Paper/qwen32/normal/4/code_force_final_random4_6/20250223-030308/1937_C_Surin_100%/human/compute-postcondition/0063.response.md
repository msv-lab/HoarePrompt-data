Let's break down the given information and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
2. `n` is an integer greater than 1.
3. `i` is incremented by 1 (this means `i` has some initial value, and we are told it is incremented by 1, so `i` is `i + 1`).
4. `r` is the value of `input()` (this means `r` is assigned the value that the user inputs, but it is not used in the print statement).

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

### Analysis:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so it will print the new value of `i`.
- `prev` is not defined in the initial state, so we can assume `prev` has some value that was set earlier in the code, but we don't know what it is from the given information. We will denote it as `prev` in the output.

### Output:
The print statement will output a formatted string starting with `?` followed by the new value of `i` twice, and then the value of `prev` twice.

Output: **? [i] [i] [prev] [prev] (where [i] is the incremented value of i and [prev] is the value of prev)**
