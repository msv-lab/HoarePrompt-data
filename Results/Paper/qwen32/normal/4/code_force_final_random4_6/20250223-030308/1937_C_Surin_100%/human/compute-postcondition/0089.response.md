The code snippet provided reads a new input string and assigns it to the variable `r`. No other variables are modified by this code snippet.

Given the initial state, the variable `r` is being updated to a new input string, while all other variables retain their previous values. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i` if `r` equals `'<'`, otherwise `v1` remains 0, `prev` is the last `i` for which `r` was `'>'` or `r` was `'='` and `r2` was `'<'`, `kp` is incremented by 1, `v2` is `i + 1`, `r` is the new input string, `i` is `i + 1`**.
