Postcondition: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `prev` is `i` if `r2` is `'<'`, otherwise `prev` remains 0, `kp` is incremented by 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or `0` if no `'<'` was received), `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is an input string, `r` is not `'>'`, and if `r` is equal to `'='`, `r2` is the new input string.**
