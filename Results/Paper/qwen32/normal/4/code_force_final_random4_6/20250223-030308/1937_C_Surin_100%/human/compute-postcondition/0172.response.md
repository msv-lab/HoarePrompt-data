To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head: `i` and `n`.

Here is the given for loop:
```
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The `range(1, n)` function generates numbers starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1. The value of `i` is automatically initialized to 1 at the start of the loop, so we do not need to adjust `i` before the loop starts.

Let's consider the provided state:
- `t` is unchanged.
- `n` is the integer value of the user's input.
- `prev` is 0.
- `kp` is incremented by 1.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or `0` if no `'<'` was received).
- `v2` is `n-1`.

Since only `i` and `n` are relevant for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1. The other variables (`t`, `prev`, `kp`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`) do not affect the execution of the loop and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute is:
State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` must be greater than 1, `prev` is 0, `kp` is incremented by 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or `0` if no `'<'` was received), `v2` is `n-1`**
