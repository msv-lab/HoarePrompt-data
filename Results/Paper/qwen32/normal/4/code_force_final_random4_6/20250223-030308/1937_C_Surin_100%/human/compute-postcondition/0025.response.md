The code snippet `r = input('')` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `r`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `v2` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the input operation.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `i + 2`
- `n` is an integer greater than `i + 2`
- `v2` is `i + 2`

Since `r` is assigned the value of the user input, the output state will include `r` with the value provided by the user.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `n` is an integer greater than `i + 2`, `v2` is `i + 2`, `r` is the user input**.
