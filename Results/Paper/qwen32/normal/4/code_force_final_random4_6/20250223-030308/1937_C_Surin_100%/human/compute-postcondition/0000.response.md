The given code snippet defines a lambda function `I` that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split string into an integer, returning the result as a list. This lambda function does not affect the variables `t` or `n` directly, nor does it define or modify the secret permutation `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}`. The precondition regarding the values of `t` and `n`, as well as the properties of the permutation, remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and there exists a secret permutation `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}; `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split string into an integer, returning the result as a list.**
