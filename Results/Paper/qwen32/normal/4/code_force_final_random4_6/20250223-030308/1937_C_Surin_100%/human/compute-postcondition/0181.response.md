The provided code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the console or file immediately. It does not change any variables or their values; it only affects the output stream.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, no variables are affected. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` must be greater than 1, `prev` is 0, `kp` is incremented by 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or `0` if no `'<'` was received), `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is an input string, `r` is not `'>'`, and `r` is equal to `'='`.**
