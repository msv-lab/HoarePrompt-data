The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `1`, `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because the range starts from 1 and goes up to, but does not include, `n`.

Given that the initial state includes `t` and `prev`, these variables do not affect the execution of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted. The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 1 when the loop starts, so it does not need to be adjusted in the initial state.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is some value, `prev` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1**
