Postcondition: **`t` is some value, `n` is greater than 1, `r` is the value provided by the user, `i` is incremented by 1. If `r` is equal to '>', `prev` is equal to `i`. If `r` is equal to '=', `r2` is the value provided by the user as input. If `r2` is equal to '<', then `prev` is set to the value of `i`. Otherwise, `prev` remains unchanged. If `r` is neither '>' nor '=', `prev` remains unchanged.**
