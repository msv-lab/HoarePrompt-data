The code snippet `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` to `v1`. Given that `v2` is `i+2`, after this assignment, `v1` will also be `i+2`. The values of `i`, `r`, and `n` remain unchanged. The initial state mentioned that `v1` is `i+1` if the original `r` equals `<`, otherwise `v1` is undefined. However, since `v1` is reassigned to `v2`, which is `i+2`, the condition regarding `r` becomes irrelevant for `v1` in the output state.

Output State: **`i` is `i+2`, `v2` is `i+2`, `r` is the new input string, `v1` is `i+2`, `n` is unchanged**.
