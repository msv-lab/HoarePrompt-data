Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the input `r` was `<`. If no `r` was `<`, `v1` is 0. If `r` is `'>'`, `prev` is set to `i`. If `r` is `'='`, `prev` is set to `i` if `r2` is `'<'`, otherwise `prev` remains unchanged. If `r` is neither `'>'` nor `'='`, `prev` remains unchanged. `r` is the user's input, `i` is incremented by 1; `r2` is the new user's input. If `r2` is `'<'`, `prev` is set to `i`. If `r` is `'='` and `r2` is `'<'`, `prev` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `prev` remains unchanged.**
