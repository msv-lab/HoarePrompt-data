The value of `v2` is reassigned to be equal to `i`. The value of `i` is `i+2`, so `v2` will now also be `i+2`. The values of `r`, `v1`, and `n` remain unchanged. If `r` equals `<`, `v1` is `i+1`; otherwise, `v1` is undefined. The value of `n` is unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i+2`, `v2` is `i+2`, `r` is an input string, `v1` is `i+1` if `r` equals `<`, otherwise `v1` is undefined, `n` is unchanged**.
