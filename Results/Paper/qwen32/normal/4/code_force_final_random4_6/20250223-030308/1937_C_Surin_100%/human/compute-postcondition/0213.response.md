To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state provided and understand the roles of the variables `prev` and `v1`.

### Analysis of Variables:
- `t`: Unchanged, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.
- `n`: The integer value of the user's input, but its value is not directly used in the print statement.
- `kp`: Incremented by 1, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.
- `g`: Set to 0, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.
- `v1`: The last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or `0` if no `'<'` was received).
- `v2`: Set to `n-1`, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.
- `prev`: The last value of `i` for which the input was `'>'` or `'='` followed by `'<'` (or `0` if no such input was received).

### Determining Values:
- `v1` is explicitly described as being the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or `0` if no such input was received).
- `prev` is explicitly described as being the last value of `i` for which the input was `'>'` or `'='` followed by `'<'` (or `0` if no such input was received).

### Print Statement:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
```
This will print the string `'!'` followed by the values of `prev` and `v1`.

### Final Output:
Based on the initial state provided, the output will be:
Output: **! [prev] [v1] (where [prev] is the last value of i for which the input was '>' or '=' followed by '<' (or 0 if no such input was received), and [v1] is the last value of i for which the input was '<' (or 0 if no '<' was received))**
