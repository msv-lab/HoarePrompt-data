Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and there exists a secret permutation `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}; `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split string into an integer, returning the result as a list; `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer.
Code of the loop:
for kp in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    g = 0
    v1 = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        v2 = i
        print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r = input('')
        if r == '<':
            v1 = v2
    prev = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r = input()
        if r == '>':
            prev = i
        elif r == '=':
            print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r2 = input('')
            if r2 == '<':
                prev = i
    print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
    sys.stdout.flush()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the input `r` was `<`. If no `r` was `<`, `v1` is 0, `prev` is the last `i` for which `r` was `'>'` or `r` was `'='` and `r2` was `'<'`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `prev` is the value determined by the user's inputs throughout the `n-1` iterations of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is unchanged, `n` is the integer value of the user's input, `kp` is incremented by 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or `0` if no `'<'` was received), `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'>'` or `'='` followed by `'<'` (or `0` if no such input was received).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
