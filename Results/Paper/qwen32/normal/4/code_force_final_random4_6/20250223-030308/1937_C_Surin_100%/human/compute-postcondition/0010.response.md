The code provided reads an input value but does not assign it to any variable, so the value of `r` is not used further in the provided snippet. The variables `t`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is `i`**
