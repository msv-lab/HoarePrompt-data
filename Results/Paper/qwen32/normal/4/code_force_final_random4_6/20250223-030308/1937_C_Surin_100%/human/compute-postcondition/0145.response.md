The code snippet reassigns the value of `n` to the integer value of the user's input. The values of `t`, `prev`, and `kp` remain unchanged. The new value of `n` will be whatever integer the user inputs.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is the integer value of the user's input, `prev` is the value determined by the user's inputs throughout the `n-1` iterations of the loop, `kp` is incremented by 1.**
