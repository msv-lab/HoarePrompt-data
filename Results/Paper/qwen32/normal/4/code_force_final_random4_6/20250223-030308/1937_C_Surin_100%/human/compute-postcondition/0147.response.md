Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is the integer value of the user's input, `prev` is the value determined by the user's inputs throughout the `n-1` iterations of the loop, `kp` is incremented by 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0.**

Natural Language: The variable `v1` has been assigned the value 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `prev`, `kp`, and `g`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
