The code snippet provided only contains the line `g = 0`, which sets the variable `g` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `v1`, `prev`, or `kp`) are affected by this line.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is the integer input by the user; `g` is 0; `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the input `r` was `<`. If no `r` was `<`, `v1` is 0; `prev` is the last `i` for which `r` was `'>'` or `r` was `'='` and `r2` was `'<'`; `kp` is incremented by 1**.
