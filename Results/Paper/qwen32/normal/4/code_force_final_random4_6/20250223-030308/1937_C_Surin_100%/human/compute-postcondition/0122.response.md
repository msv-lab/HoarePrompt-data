Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is some value (not explicitly defined, not used in the print statement).
- `n` is greater than 1 (not explicitly defined, not used in the print statement).
- `r` is the value provided by the user (not explicitly defined, not used in the print statement).
- `i` is incremented by 1 (implies `i` has some initial value, and it is incremented by 1 before this print statement).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement uses an f-string to format the output.
- It includes the value of `i` twice.
- It also includes the value of `prev` twice.

### Knowns and Unknowns:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1 before the print statement, so if `i` was initially `x`, it will now be `x + 1`.
- The value of `prev` is not defined in the given initial state, so it could be any value.

### Output Description:
- The output will start with a literal `?`.
- It will then print the current value of `i` twice.
- It will then print the value of `prev` twice.

Since the exact value of `i` and `prev` are not provided, we can only describe them in terms of their definitions.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [i] [i] [prev] [prev] (where i is the incremented value and prev is the value provided or defined elsewhere in the code)**
