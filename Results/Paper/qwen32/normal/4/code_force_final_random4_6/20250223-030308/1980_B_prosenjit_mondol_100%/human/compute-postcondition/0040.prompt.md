Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n, f, and k are integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 100.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
    f -= 1
    k -= 1
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    x = a[f]
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    if a[k] > x:
        print('NO')
    elif a[k] < x:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k + 1] < x else 'MAYBE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `f` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `k` is the third integer from the input minus 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order, `x` is `a[f]`. If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, then `a[k]` is greater than `x`. Otherwise, `a[k]` is less than or equal to `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 999, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `f` is the second integer from the new input minus 2, `k` is the third integer from the new input minus 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and sorted in descending order, `x` is the element at index `f` in the list `a`. No additional changes are made to the variables regardless of whether `a[k] > x` or `a[k] <= x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 999, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `f` is the second integer from the new input minus 1, `k` is the third integer from the new input minus 1, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input and sorted in descending order, `x` is the element at index `f` in the list `a`. The loop will execute one more time if the input integer for the range is greater than 0. If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, the condition is met; otherwise, the condition is not met. In both cases, the values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
