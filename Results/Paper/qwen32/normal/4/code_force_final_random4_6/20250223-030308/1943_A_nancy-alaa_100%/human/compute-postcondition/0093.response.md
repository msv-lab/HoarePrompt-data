Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine the output of the `print(i)` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`n`**: Must be at least `i + 1`. This means `n` is an integer and `i` is an integer such that `n >= i + 1`.
2. **`arr`**: A list of integers obtained from an input string split by spaces.
3. **`mpp`**: A `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
4. **`i`**: Initially, `i` is an integer. The value of `i` is not explicitly given, but it is used to index into `arr` and check in `mpp`.
5. **`first`**: A boolean variable that is set to `True` if `i` was not a key in `mpp` before the if statement. Otherwise, it remains unchanged.
6. **The if statement and loop logic**: 
   - If `i` was not a key in `mpp`, `first` is set to `True` and `i` is added to `mpp` with a frequency of 1.
   - `i` is then incremented by 1.
   - If the new `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, the loop or if statement is broken out of.

### Code Snippet:
The code snippet is simply:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The value of `i` is initially some integer.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1 after the if statement.
- The print statement will output the value of `i` after it has been incremented.

### Output:
Since `i` is incremented by 1 before the print statement, the printed value of `i` will be the initial value of `i` plus 1.

Output: **i + 1 (where i is the initial value of i before the increment)**
