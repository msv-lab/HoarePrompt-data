Postcondition: **`n` must be at least `i + 2`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split by spaces, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is `True`, `i` is `i + 2`. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
