Let's break down the given initial state and understand the variables involved:

1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4. This is a loop counter or similar, but it's not directly relevant to the `print(i)` statement.
2. `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0. This variable is not directly relevant to the `print(i)` statement either.
3. `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input line and converting each split component to an integer. This variable is not directly relevant to the `print(i)` statement.
4. `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`. This variable is not directly relevant to the `print(i)` statement.
5. `first` is a boolean. This variable is not directly relevant to the `print(i)` statement.
6. `i` is `i + 1`. This statement suggests that `i` is incremented by 1, but it does not provide the initial value of `i`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `i` without more information.

Given the information provided, we can only say that the value of `i` is whatever its current value is plus 1. Since the initial value of `i` is not specified, we can't provide a precise numerical value for `i`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(i)` statement will be the value of `i` after it has been incremented by 1.

Output: **i (where i is the value of i after being incremented by 1)**
