Output State: **`n` is an input integer; the loop prints the first integer `i` that is not in `mpp.keys()` or the first integer `i` such that `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `True`. The variable `first` will be `True` if an integer `i` with `mpp[i] == 1` has been encountered, and the variable `i` will be the last value it took before the loop broke. The loop has not yet exhausted the number of iterations specified by `int(input())`.**

Natural Language: The variable `n` is now an integer obtained from the input. The conditions and behavior of the loop remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
