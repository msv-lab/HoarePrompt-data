Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `n` must be at least 0.
2. `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split by spaces.
3. `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
4. `first` is False.
5. `i` is not a key in `mpp`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is mentioned to not be a key in the `mpp` Counter object. However, the specific value of `i` is not directly provided in the initial state. The only information we have about `i` is that it is not one of the keys in the `mpp` dictionary.
- Since `i` is not a key in `mpp`, it means `i` is not an element in the list `arr` because `mpp` counts the frequency of elements in `arr`.

### Output:
Given the initial state, the value of `i` is not explicitly defined, but we know it is not an element of the list `arr`. Thus, the printed value of `i` will be whatever value it holds, which is not specified in the initial state.

Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we can only describe it as a value that is not a key in `mpp`.

Output: **i (where i is a value not present in the list arr)**
