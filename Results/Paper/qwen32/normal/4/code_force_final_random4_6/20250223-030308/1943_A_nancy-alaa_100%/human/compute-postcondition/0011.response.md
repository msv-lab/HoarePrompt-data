Let's break down the given initial state and determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4. This variable `t` represents the number of test cases or iterations, but it is not directly used in the given print statement.
2. `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0. This variable `n` likely represents the number of elements in the list `arr`.
3. `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input line and converting each split component to an integer. This is the main list of integers we are working with.
4. `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`. This means `mpp` is a dictionary-like object where keys are the unique integers from `arr` and values are their respective counts.
5. `first` is a boolean variable set to `True`, but it is not used in the given print statement.
6. `i` is a key in `mpp` with `mpp[i]` equal to 1. This means `i` is an integer that appears exactly once in the list `arr`.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(i)
```
Here, `i` is a key in the `mpp` dictionary where the count of `i` is 1. This implies that `i` is an integer in `arr` that occurs exactly once.

### Output:
Since `i` is defined as an integer that appears exactly once in `arr`, the print statement will output this integer.

Output: **i (where i is an integer that appears exactly once in the list `arr`)**
