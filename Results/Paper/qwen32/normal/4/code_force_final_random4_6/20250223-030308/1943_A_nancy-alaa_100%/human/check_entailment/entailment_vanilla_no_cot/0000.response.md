Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. The program seems to be attempting to find the MEX based on the counts of elements in the original array `a`, but it does not account for the strategic choices made by Alice and Bob.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider how Alice and Bob will play optimally:

1. **Alice's Strategy**: Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`. To do this, she should aim to include as many distinct elements as possible in `c` before Bob can block her.
2. **Bob's Strategy**: Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`. To do this, he should try to prevent Alice from including certain elements that would increase the MEX.

The optimal strategy involves understanding the distribution of elements in the array and how they can be picked by Alice and Bob. Here is a correct approach:

- Count the occurrences of each element in the array.
- Alice will try to pick elements in such a way that the smallest missing number (MEX) is maximized. This means she will try to fill in the smallest numbers first.
- Bob will try to block Alice from picking elements that would increase the MEX.

The correct solution involves iterating through the numbers from 0 to n and determining the MEX based on the counts and the turns of Alice and Bob.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        mex = 0
        while True:
            if mex in mpp and mpp[mex] > 0:
                mpp[mex] -= 1
                if mpp[mex] == 0:
                    del mpp[mex]
                mex += 1
            else:
                print(mex)
                break

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the MEX by simulating the process of Alice and Bob picking elements optimally.
