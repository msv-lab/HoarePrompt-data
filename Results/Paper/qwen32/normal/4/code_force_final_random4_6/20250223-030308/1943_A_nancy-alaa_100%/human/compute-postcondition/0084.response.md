The `break` statement will terminate the innermost loop or conditional block it is placed in, but it does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split by spaces, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is True, and `i` is a key in `mpp` with a frequency of 1.**
