Let's break down the given initial state and understand the variables and their values step by step:

1. **`n` must be at least 0**: This tells us that `n` is a non-negative integer, but its exact value is not specified.

2. **`arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split by spaces**: This means `arr` is a list of integers, and these integers were derived from an input string where the integers were separated by spaces.

3. **`mpp` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each integer in `arr`**: A `Counter` object from the `collections` module in Python creates a dictionary-like object where keys are the elements from the list `arr` and values are the counts of how many times each element appears in the list.

4. **`first` is True**: This is a boolean variable, and it is set to `True`.

5. **`i` is a key in `mpp` with a frequency of 1**: This means `i` is an integer that appears exactly once in the list `arr`. The `Counter` object `mpp` will have a key `i` with a value of 1.

Given this information, the `print(i)` statement will print the integer `i`, which is a unique element in the list `arr` (an element that appears exactly once).

Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `i`. However, we can describe it as an integer that appears exactly once in the list `arr`.

Output: **i (where i is an integer that appears exactly once in the list `arr`)**
