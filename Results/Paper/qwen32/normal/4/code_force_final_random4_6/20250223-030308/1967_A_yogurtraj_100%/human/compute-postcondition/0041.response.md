To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the relationships between the variables.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `ii` is 0.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is initially defined as `k - (n-1) * (a[n-1] - a[n-2])` and then set to 0.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.
- `r` is the last element of the list `a`, i.e., `a[n-1]`.
- `rem` is 0.
- `y` is 0.

### Expression Breakdown:
The expression in the `print` statement is:
```
(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y
```

Let's substitute the known values into this expression:
- `r` is `a[n-1]`, the last element of the sorted list `a`.
- `rem` is 0.
- `y` is 0.

So the expression simplifies to:
```
(r - 1) * n + 1 + 0 + 0
```
Which further simplifies to:
```
(r - 1) * n + 1
```

### Final Output:
The final output depends on the value of `r` (which is `a[n-1]`, the last element of the sorted list `a`) and `n` (the first integer from the input).

Since we don't have the exact values of `a` and `n`, we can only express the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(r - 1) * n + 1 (where r is the last element of the sorted list `a` and n is the first integer from the input)**
