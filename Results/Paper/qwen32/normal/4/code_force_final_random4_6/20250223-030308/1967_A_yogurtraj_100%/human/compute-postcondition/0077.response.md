The code snippet assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to `r`. Given that `i` is 3, `r` will be assigned the value of `a[4]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is at least 4, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 3, `k` is `k_initial - 4 * (a[4] - a[3])`, `r` is `a[4]`**.
