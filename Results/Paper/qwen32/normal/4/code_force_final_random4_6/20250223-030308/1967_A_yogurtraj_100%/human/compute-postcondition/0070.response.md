The loop head in the given for loop is `i` and `n`. Only these variables can be adjusted to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `ii` is 1
- `n` is at least 2
- `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input
- `i` is 2

The loop condition is `for i in range(0, n - 1)`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. The value of `n` does not need to be adjusted since the condition `i < n - 1` will still be true as long as `n` is at least 4 (since `i` will be 3 and `n - 1` will be at least 3).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is at least 4, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 3**
