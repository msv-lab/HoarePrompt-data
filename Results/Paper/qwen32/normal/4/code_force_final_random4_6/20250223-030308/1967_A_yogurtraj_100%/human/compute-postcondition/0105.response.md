To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100
- `ii` is 2
- `n` is an integer greater than 0
- `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input
- `i` is 3

Code Snippet:
```
r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
```

From the code snippet, `r` is assigned the value of `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`. Here, `i` is 3, so `a[i]` refers to the element at index 3 in the list `a`. The value of `k` is not specified in the initial state, so we will keep it as `k` in our output. 

The variables `t`, `ii`, `n`, and `a` are not modified by this statement, so they retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input, `i` is 3, `r` is `a[3] + k // 4`**.
