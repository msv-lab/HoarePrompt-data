The value of `r` is updated to `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input, `k` is the integer input, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0. Additionally, `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input, `k` is the integer input, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0. Additionally, `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`.**
