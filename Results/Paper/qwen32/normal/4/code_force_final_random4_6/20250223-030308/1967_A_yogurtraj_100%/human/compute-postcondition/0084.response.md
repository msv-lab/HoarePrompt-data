To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the expression inside the `print` statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `ii` is 1.
- `n` is the number of elements in the list `a`.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `r` is the last element of the list `a` (i.e., `a[n - 1]`).
- `rem` is 0.
- `y` is 0.
- `k` is 0.

### Expression to Evaluate:
The expression inside the `print` statement is:
```
(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y
```

### Step-by-Step Evaluation:
1. **Determine `r`**: `r` is the last element of the sorted list `a`. Since `a` is sorted and contains integers, `r` is the largest integer in the list.
2. **Determine `n`**: `n` is the number of elements in the list `a`. This is a fixed value based on the length of the list `a`.
3. **Determine `rem` and `y`**: Both `rem` and `y` are explicitly stated as 0.

Now, let's substitute the known values into the expression:
- `rem` is 0.
- `y` is 0.

So the expression simplifies to:
```
(r - 1) * n + 1 + 0 + 0
```
Which further simplifies to:
```
(r - 1) * n + 1
```

### Final Output Description:
The expression `(r - 1) * n + 1` will be evaluated based on the values of `r` and `n`. Since `r` is the last (largest) element in the sorted list `a` and `n` is the number of elements in `a`, the expression represents a specific calculation involving these values.

However, without the exact values of `r` and `n`, we can't compute the exact numerical value. But we can describe the output in terms of `r` and `n`:

Output: **(r - 1) * n + 1 (where r is the last element of the sorted list `a` and n is the number of elements in `a`)**
