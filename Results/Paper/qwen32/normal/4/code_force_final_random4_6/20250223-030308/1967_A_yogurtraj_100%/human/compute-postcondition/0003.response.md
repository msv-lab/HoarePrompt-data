The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `t`, `ii`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.**
