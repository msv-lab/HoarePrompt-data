Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0. If ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k), then `k` is 0, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, and the loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is `a[i + 1]`.**
