The code snippet `r = a[i + 1]` assigns the value of the element at index `i + 1` in the list `a` to the variable `r`. Given that `i` is 4, the value of `r` will be `a[5]`.

The other variables (`t`, `ii`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and `k`) remain unchanged by this operation. Specifically, `k` has been modified in the initial state, but its new value is not relevant to the execution of this particular line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input, `i` is 4, `k` is decreased by `5 * (a[5] - a[4])`, `r` is `a[5]`.**
