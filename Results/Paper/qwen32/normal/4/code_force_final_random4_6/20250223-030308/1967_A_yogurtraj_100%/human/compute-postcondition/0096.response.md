The given code snippet calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `(i + 1)` and assigns it to the variable `rem`. The other variables remain unchanged. Here is the updated state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input, `k` is the integer input, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is 0. Additionally, `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`.**
