The code snippet calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1` and assigns it to the variable `rem`. The variables `t`, `ii`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and `r` are not affected by this operation.

Given that `i` is 3, the expression `i + 1` evaluates to 4. Therefore, `rem` will be the remainder of `k` divided by 4.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is at least 4, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 3, `r` is `a[3] + k // 4`, `rem` is `k % 4`.**
