Let's break down the provided initial state to understand the values of the variables involved in the `print` statement.

1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100. However, `t` is not used in the `print` statement.
2. `ii` is set to 2, but it is also not used in the `print` statement.
3. `n` is an integer greater than 0.
4. `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input.
5. `k` is updated to `k - (n - 1) * (a[n - 1] - a[n - 2])`.
6. `r` is calculated as `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
7. `rem` is set to 0, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
8. `y` is set to 0, but it is not used in the `print` statement.

The `print` statement is:
```
print((r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n)
```

Let's substitute the value of `r` into the expression:
- `r = a[n - 1] + k // n`
- Therefore, `r - 1 = a[n - 1] + k // n - 1`
- The expression becomes: `((a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n) + 1 + k % n`

Now, let's simplify the expression:
- `((a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n) + 1 + k % n`
- `= (a[n - 1] * n + (k // n) * n - n) + 1 + k % n`
- `= (a[n - 1] * n + k - n) + 1 + k % n`
- `= a[n - 1] * n + k - n + 1 + k % n`

Since `k` can be expressed as `k = k - (n - 1) * (a[n - 1] - a[n - 2])`, the exact value of `k` depends on the input values. However, the expression `a[n - 1] * n + k - n + 1 + k % n` is what will be printed.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **a[n - 1] * n + k - n + 1 + k % n (where a[n - 1] is the last element of the sorted list `a`, n is the length of the list `a`, and k is updated to k - (n - 1) * (a[n - 1] - a[n - 2]))**
