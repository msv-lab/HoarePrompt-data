The code snippet provided reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to the variable `b`. The initial state mentions that `b_i` is a list of `m` integers, and this list is being updated by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are the integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
