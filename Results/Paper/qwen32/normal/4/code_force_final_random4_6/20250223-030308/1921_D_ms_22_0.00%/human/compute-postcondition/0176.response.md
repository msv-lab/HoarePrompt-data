Output State: **`max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element, `b` is a list of integers read from the input and is now sorted, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`.**

In this output state, `diff2` has been calculated as the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of the sorted list `b`. All other variables retain their initial values or states as described in the initial state.
