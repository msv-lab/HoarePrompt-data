The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string components, converts each of these components to an integer, and then assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`.

Given the initial state, `a` was previously described as a list of `n` integers. After executing the code snippet, `a` will be updated to reflect the new list of integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is an integer between 0 and `m`, `tp2` is an integer between 0 and `m`, and `ans` is the accumulated sum of the largest differences found during the loop.**
