The code snippet `tp1 = 0` sets the variable `tp1` to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` are adjusted indices, `ans` is the sum of the minimum differences, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input and is now sorted.**
