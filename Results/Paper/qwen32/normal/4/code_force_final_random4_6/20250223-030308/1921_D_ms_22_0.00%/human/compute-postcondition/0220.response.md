Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, i, index)` (one less than before), `t` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `n` elements, and `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `item` is the tuple `(-diff, i, index)` that was popped from `max_heap`; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`; `tp1` is incremented by 1; `ans` is increased by `diff1`.**

In simple terms: The variable `ans` has been increased by the value of `diff1`, which is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`. All other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state, except for `ans` which has been updated.
