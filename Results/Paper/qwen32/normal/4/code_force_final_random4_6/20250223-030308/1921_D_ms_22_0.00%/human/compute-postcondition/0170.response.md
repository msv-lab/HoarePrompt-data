Output State: **`max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` and `tp2` are adjusted indices, `ans` is the sum of the minimum differences, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input and is now sorted.**

Explanation: The code snippet `max_heap = []` reassigns `max_heap` to an empty list, but it does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the other variables retain their initial values or states as described in the initial state.
