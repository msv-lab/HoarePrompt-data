The code snippet pushes a tuple into the `max_heap` using the `heapq.heappush` function. The tuple consists of the negative of `diff1`, the value of `i`, and 0. This operation modifies the `max_heap` by adding the new tuple, but it does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `diff1`, or `diff2`. The `max_heap` now contains at least one element, which is the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` is a list containing the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and `diff1` is greater than `diff2`.**
