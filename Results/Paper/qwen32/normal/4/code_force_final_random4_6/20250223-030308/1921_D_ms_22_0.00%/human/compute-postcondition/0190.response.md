Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing two tuples. The first tuple is `(-diff1, i_next, 0)` if `diff1` (which is `abs(i_next - b[0])`) is greater than `diff2` (which is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`), otherwise it is `(-diff2, i_next, m - 1)`. The second tuple is `(-diff1, i_next, 0)` if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, otherwise it is `(-diff2, i_next, m - 1)`. The variables `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, with `tp1` being 0, `tp2` being `m - 1`, `ans` being 0, `t` being greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `n` and `m` being integers read from the input, `a` being a list of integers read from the input with at least one element, and `b` being a sorted list of integers read from the input. `i` is the next element in `a` if there are more elements to process, denoted as `i_next`. `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])` and `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`.** 

In simpler terms: The variable `diff2` is now updated to `abs(i - b[m - 1])`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the `max_heap` list's tuples are conditionally updated based on the new value of `diff2`.
