Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is `-n`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, and `max_heap` is a list containing `n` tuples of the form `(-diff, a[i], index_in_b)`.
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is `-n`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples of the form `(-diff, a[i], index_in_b)`, `item` is the tuple `(-diff, a[i], index_in_b)` that was popped from `max_heap`, and `ans` is updated based on the conditions. If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, then `tp1` and `tp2` are reset to 1 and `m - 1` respectively if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, otherwise `tp1` and `tp2` are reset to 0 and `m - 2` respectively, and `ans` is set to the larger of `diff1` or `diff2`. If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, `ans` is updated by adding `diff`, and `tp1` or `tp2` is updated to 1 or `m - 2` respectively depending on whether `item[2]` equals `tp1`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is `-n`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` has one less element, `item` is the tuple `(-diff, a[i], index_in_b)` that was popped from `max_heap`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `ans` is updated by adding `diff1` to it and `tp1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated by adding `diff2` to it and `tp2` is decremented by 1. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, `ans` is updated to `ans + diff` and `tp1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans + diff` and `tp2` is decremented by 1.`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is `-n`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` has one less element than before, `item` is the tuple `(-diff, a[i], index_in_b)` that was popped from `max_heap`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`, and if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`; otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, `ans` is updated to `ans + diff` and `tp1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans + diff` and `tp2` is decremented by 1`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
