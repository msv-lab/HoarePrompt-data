### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the total difference between Petya's array `a` and Vasya's array `c`, which is formed from a selection of integers from Vasya's array `b`. The algorithm leverages a max-heap to keep track of the largest possible differences for each element in `a` against the smallest and largest elements in `b`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm and its correctness:

1. **Sort the Array `b`:** The array `b` is sorted to facilitate the calculation of differences between elements of `a` and the closest elements in `b`.
   
2. **Initialize a Max-Heap:** A max-heap (`max_heap`) is used to store the largest differences for each element in `a` along with the index of the corresponding element in `b` that gives this difference.

3. **Calculate Initial Differences:**
   - For each element `i` in `a`, the program calculates the absolute differences with the smallest (`b[0]`) and largest (`b[m-1]`) elements in `b`.
   - The larger of these two differences is pushed onto the max-heap with a negative sign to simulate a max-heap using Python's `heapq` (which is a min-heap by default).

4. **Process the Max-Heap:**
   - The program pops elements from the max-heap one by one.
   - If the index of the element in `b` is out of bounds (`tp1` to `tp2`), it recalculates the differences using the next smallest and largest available elements in `b` and updates `ans` accordingly.
   - If the index is within bounds, it adds the stored difference to `ans` and updates the pointers `tp1` or `tp2` to reflect the used element in `b`.

5. **Output the Result:** After processing all elements in `a`, the accumulated sum of differences (`ans`) is printed as the result for the current test case.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the strategy of maximizing the differences by always choosing the largest possible difference for each element in `a` against the available elements in `b`. The use of a max-heap ensures that the largest differences are considered first, and the pointers `tp1` and `tp2` efficiently manage the selection of elements from `b`.

Given the problem constraints and the described algorithm, the program should produce the correct results for all valid inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
