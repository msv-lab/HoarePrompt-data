The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must have been greater than 0 for the loop to have executed. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `t` needs to be greater than 0 after the previous iteration.

State: **`max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` and `tp2` are adjusted indices, `ans` is the sum of the minimum differences, `t` must be greater than 0**
