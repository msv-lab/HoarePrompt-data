Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is an integer between 0 and `m`, `tp2` is an integer between 0 and `m`, and `ans` is the accumulated sum of the largest differences found during the loop for all test cases.**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be 0, indicating that no more test cases remain to be processed. The variables `n` and `m`, as well as the lists `a` and `b`, will retain their values from the last test case processed. The `max_heap` will be empty, and the indices `tp1` and `tp2` will reflect the final positions in the list `b` after processing all test cases. The variable `ans` will hold the total accumulated sum of the largest differences found during the loop for all test cases.
