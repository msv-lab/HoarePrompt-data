The code snippet `ans += -item[0]` subtracts the first element of the tuple `item` from `ans`. Given that `item` is a tuple that was popped from `max_heap`, and `max_heap` contains at least one tuple, we can assume `item[0]` is the first element of that tuple. Since `max_heap` is a max heap, `item[0]` is typically the largest element in the heap before the pop operation.

The value of `ans` will be updated to its current value minus the first element of `item`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `max_heap` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple after the pop operation, `item` is the tuple that was popped from `max_heap`, `ans` is updated to `ans - item[0]`.**
