The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string elements, converts each of these elements to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in the variable `b`. 

The initial state mentions that `max_heap`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` have specific states or values. None of these are affected by the execution of the given code snippet. The only variable that is updated is `b`, which is assigned the new list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` and `tp2` are adjusted indices, `ans` is the sum of the minimum differences, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input.**
