Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, i, index)` (one less than before), `t` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `item` is the tuple `(-diff, i, index)` that was the smallest in `max_heap` before the pop operation, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`.**

In simpler terms: The state remains the same except that a new variable `diff1` is introduced, which holds the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the element at index `tp1` in the list `b`.
