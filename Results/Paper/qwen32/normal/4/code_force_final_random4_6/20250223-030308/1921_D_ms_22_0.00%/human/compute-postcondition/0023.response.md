The code snippet `heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))` pushes a new tuple into the `max_heap` list, which is structured as a heap. The tuple contains the negative of `diff1`, the value of `i`, and the index `0`.

Given the initial state, `max_heap` already contains a tuple. The new tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` is added to `max_heap`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 and `n` is at least 1, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` contains two tuples, the first one is `(-abs(i - b[0]), i, 0)` or `(-abs(i - b[m - 1]), i, m - 1)` and the second one is `(-diff1, i, 0)`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(new_i - b[m - 1])`.**
