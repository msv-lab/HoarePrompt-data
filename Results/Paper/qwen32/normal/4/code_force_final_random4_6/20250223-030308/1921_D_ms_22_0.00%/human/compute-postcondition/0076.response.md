The given code snippet is:

```python
ans += -item[0]
```

This line of code is equivalent to:

```python
ans = ans - item[0]
```

The impact of this code is that it subtracts the value of `item[0]` from `ans`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, and `item` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple after the pop operation, `item` is the tuple that was popped from `max_heap`. `ans` is updated to `ans - item[0]`.**
