The code snippet `item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)` removes and returns the smallest element from the `max_heap`. Since the heap contains tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)`, the smallest element (which is the largest `diff` due to the negative sign) is removed. 

Hereâ€™s the impact:
- `max_heap` will have one less element.
- `item` will hold the tuple that was the smallest in the heap, which corresponds to the largest `diff`.

Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, i, index)` (one less than before), `t` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `item` is the tuple `(-diff, i, index)` that was the smallest in `max_heap` before the pop operation.**
