The code snippet adds a new tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` to the `max_heap` list using `heapq.heappush`. Given the initial state, `max_heap` already contains two tuples. After the `heappush` operation, `max_heap` will have three tuples.

The values of the other variables (`tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `diff1`, `diff2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing three tuples: the first two tuples are either `(-diff1, i_next, 0)` or `(-diff2, i_next, m - 1)` based on the comparison of `diff1` and `diff2`, and the third tuple is `(-diff1, i, 0)`. `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with at least one element, and `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input. `i` is the next element in `a` if there are more elements to process, denoted as `i_next`. `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])` and `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`.**
