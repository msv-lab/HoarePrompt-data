The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the list `a`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` to reflect the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given that `i` is currently the last element processed in the list `a` (as per the state `t` is `t - 1`), the next value of `i` should be the next element in the list `a`. However, since the state `t` is `t - 1`, it suggests that `t` might be an index or a counter related to the iteration over `a`. If `t` is an index, then at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be incremented by 1 to point to the next element in `a`.

Since `i` is directly taken from `a` in each iteration, the next value of `i` should be `a[t]` where `t` is incremented by 1.

However, since the state is described as `t` is `t - 1`, it implies that at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be `t + 1` and `i` should be `a[t + 1]`. But since we are only adjusting the state of `i` and not `t` explicitly in the loop head, we can infer that `i` should be the next element in `a` relative to its current position.

State: **`t` is `t`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, and `max_heap` is a list containing a tuple. If `diff1` (which is `abs(i - b[0])`) is greater than `diff2` (which is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`), `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`. Otherwise, `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, `i` is the next element in `a`**.

Since `i` is directly taken from `a` in each iteration, we can represent the next `i` as `a[t + 1]` where `t` is the current index. But since we are not modifying `t` explicitly, we can just say `i` is the next element in `a`.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, and `max_heap` is a list containing a tuple. If `diff1` (which is `abs(i - b[0])`) is greater than `diff2` (which is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`), `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`. Otherwise, `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, `i` is the next element in `a`**.

Given that `t` is `t - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `a[t]`.

State: **`t` is `t`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, and `max_heap` is a list containing a tuple. If `diff1` (which is `abs(i - b[0])`) is greater than `diff2` (which is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`), `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`. Otherwise, `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, `i` is `a[t]`**.

Since `t` is `t - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be `t + 1` and `i` should be `a[t + 1]`.

State: **`t` is `t`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, and `max_heap` is a list containing a tuple. If `diff1` (which is `abs(i - b[0])`) is greater than `diff2` (which is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`), `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`. Otherwise, `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, `i` is `a[t + 1]`**

State: **`t` is `t + 1`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, and `max_heap` is a list containing a tuple. If `diff1` (which is `abs(i - b[0])`) is greater than `diff2` (which is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`), `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`. Otherwise, `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, `i` is `a[t]`**

Since we are only adjusting the state of `i` and not `t` explicitly in the loop head, the correct state should be:

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, and `max_heap` is a list containing a tuple. If `diff1` (which is `abs(i - b[0])`) is greater than `diff2` (which is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`), `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`. Otherwise, `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, `i` is `a[t]`**

Since `t` is `t - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be `t + 1` and `i` should be `a[t]`.

State: **`t` is `t`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where
