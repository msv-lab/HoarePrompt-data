The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `max_heap`. No other variables are modified or used in this snippet. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, and `max_heap` is an empty list.**
