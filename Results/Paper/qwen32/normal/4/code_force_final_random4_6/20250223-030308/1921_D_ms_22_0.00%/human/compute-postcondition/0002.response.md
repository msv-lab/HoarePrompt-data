To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the condition `t > 0`. The variable `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, which means `t` is already within a range that satisfies the condition `t > 0`. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes at least once.

Let's summarize the state right before the loop, ensuring that `t` is indeed greater than 0:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a_i` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b_i` is a list of `m` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

Since `t` is already guaranteed to be greater than 0 within the specified range, the state remains unchanged.
