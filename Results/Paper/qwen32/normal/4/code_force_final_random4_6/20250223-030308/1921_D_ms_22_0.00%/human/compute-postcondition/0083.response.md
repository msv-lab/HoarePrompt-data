The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, we need to adjust `t` to be greater than 0. The simplest adjustment would be to set `t` to 1, but any value greater than 0 would suffice.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is an integer between 0 and `m`, `tp2` is an integer between 0 and `m`, and `ans` is the accumulated sum of the largest differences found during the loop.**
