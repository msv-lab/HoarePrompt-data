Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem based on the given description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading:**
    - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of cities), the list of city coordinates `cities`, `m` (number of queries), and the queries themselves.

2. **Determining Closest Cities:**
    - `forward_cities` is calculated using the `func_1` function for the original list of cities.
    - `backward_cities` is calculated using the `func_1` function for the reversed list of cities.
    - The `func_1` function calculates the cost (either 1 coin for the closest city or the exact distance to the closest city) for each city to travel to its closest city.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
    - `pref_sum_f` is a list of prefix sums for the `forward_cities` list.
    - `pref_sum_b` is a list of prefix sums for the `backward_cities` list, reversed to align with the original direction.

4. **Processing Queries:**
    - For each query, the program determines if it's moving forward (`a < b`) or backward (`a > b`) and calculates the cost based on the corresponding prefix sum list.

5. **Function `func_1`:**
    - For each city, it checks the distance to the previous and next city.
    - If the next city is closer, it assigns `1` to the current position in the `prog_cities` list.
    - Otherwise, it assigns the distance to the next city.
    - Note that the function does not handle the case where the previous city is closer, which should be handled by reversing the list and recalculating.

### Issues in the Program:

- **Incorrect Handling of Closest Cities:**
    - The `func_1` function does not correctly handle the case where the previous city is closer. It should assign `1` to the current position if the previous city is closer, but the current implementation does not do this.
    - The function should also handle the edge cases where a city is at the beginning or end of the list correctly.

- **Incorrect Prefix Sum Calculation:**
    - The prefix sums are calculated based on the incorrect `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` lists. The values in these lists are not correctly representing the cost to travel to the closest city for each city.

- **Incorrect Query Processing:**
    - The program uses the prefix sums to calculate the cost for each query, but the prefix sums are not correctly calculated due to the issues in `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues described above, the program does not correctly solve the problem as intended. The `func_1` function does not correctly determine the closest city for each city, and the prefix sums are not calculated correctly based on these incorrect values.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
