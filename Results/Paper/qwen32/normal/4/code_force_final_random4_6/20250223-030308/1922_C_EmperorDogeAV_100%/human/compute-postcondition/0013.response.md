Output State: **`cities` is a list of lists, where each sublist represents a test case and contains integers. The first integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) represents the number of cities, followed by `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities. The next integer `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) represents the number of queries, followed by `m` pairs of integers x_i, y_i (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i) representing the queries. `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros except for the `i`-th element which is now `abs(forward - cities[i])`. `n` is at least 2. If `i` is greater than 0, `back` is set to `cities[i - 1]`; otherwise, `back` remains -99999999999999999999. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, `forward` is set to `cities[i + 1]`; otherwise, `forward` remains 999999999999999999. The absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `forward` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`.**

In simple terms, the `prog_cities` list now has its `i`-th element updated to the absolute difference between the `i`-th city's coordinate and the coordinate of the city immediately following it (`forward`). All other variables remain unchanged.
