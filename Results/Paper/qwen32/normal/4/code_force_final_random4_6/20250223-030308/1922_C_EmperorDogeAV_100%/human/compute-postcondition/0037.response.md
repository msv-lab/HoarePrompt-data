Output State: **The program returns the list `prog_cities` which contains `n - 1` elements where each element at index `i` is `1` if the absolute difference between `cities[i + 1]` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `cities[i - 1]` (for `i > 0`), otherwise it is the absolute difference between `cities[i + 1]` and `cities[i]`.**

This means that for each pair of consecutive cities in the `cities` list, the program checks if the distance to the next city is smaller than the distance to the previous city. If it is, it records `1` in the `prog_cities` list; otherwise, it records the actual distance to the next city.
