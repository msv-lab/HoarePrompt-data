The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `2`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`n`, `k`, `costs`, `h`, `curr`, `i`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will simply be the number `2`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `n` is initialized to `0`.
2. The variable `k` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}`.
3. The list `costs` is defined as `[1 - k, 1]`.
4. The variable `h` is defined as `n // (n - k + 1)` from the first iteration.
5. The variable `curr` is initialized to `0`.
6. The variable `i` is initialized to `1`.
7. The condition `h >= k` is provided but not relevant to the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement is `print(2)`, it will output the integer `2` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **2**
