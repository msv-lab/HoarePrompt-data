Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`; `h` is `curr`; `curr` is `n // i` where `i` is an undefined variable.**

In this output state, the value of `h` has been updated to be equal to the value of `curr`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
