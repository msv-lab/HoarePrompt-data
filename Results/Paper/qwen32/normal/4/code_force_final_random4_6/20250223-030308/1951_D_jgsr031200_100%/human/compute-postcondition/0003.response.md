Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- The current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print(1)`.
- This statement will print the integer `1` regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.

### Output:
The `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`. It simply outputs the number `1`.

Output: **1**
