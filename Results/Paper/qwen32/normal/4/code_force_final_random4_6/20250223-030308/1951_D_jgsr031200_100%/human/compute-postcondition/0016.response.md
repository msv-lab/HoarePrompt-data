The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `costs`. Therefore, we can only adjust those states for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is `n - i * curr`
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}
- `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`
- `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`
- `h` is `curr`
- `curr` is `n // i` where `i` is an undefined variable

The `for` loop iterates over the `costs` list. At the end of the previous iteration, the loop variable `i` would have taken on the value of the last element of `costs`. Since `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`, the loop variable `i` would have been `1` at the end of the previous iteration.

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to take on the next value in the `costs` list. Since the last value in `costs` was `1`, the next value to be taken by `i` would be `n - k + 1`.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be `n - k + 1`
- `costs` remains `[n - k + 1, 1]`

State: **`n` is `n - i * curr`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`; `h` is `curr`; `curr` is `n // i` where `i` is an undefined variable; `i` is `n - k + 1`**
