The code snippet provided is:

```python
curr = n // i
```

Given the initial state, `curr` is initially defined as `n // i`. However, the code reassigns `curr` to `n // i` again. This means the value of `curr` does not change from its initial value.

The other variables remain unchanged as the code does not affect them.

Output State: **`n` is `n - i * curr`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`; `h` is `curr`; `curr` is `n // i` where `i` is `n - k + 1`; `i` is `n - k + 1`**.
