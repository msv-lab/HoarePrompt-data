Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, the impact of the code on the variables can be described as follows:

The code snippet `n -= i * curr` modifies the value of `n` by subtracting the product of `i` and `curr` from it. The values of `k`, `costs`, `h`, and `curr` remain unchanged, except for the updated value of `n`.

The value of `n` after the execution of the code is `n - i * curr`.

Output State: **`n` is `n - i * curr`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`; `h` is `curr`; `curr` is `n // i` where `i` is an undefined variable.**
