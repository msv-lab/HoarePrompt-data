The code snippet `n -= i * curr` updates the value of `n` by subtracting `i * curr` from it. Given the initial state, we know that `i` is `n - k + 1` and `curr` is `n // i`. Therefore, `i * curr` is `(n - k + 1) * (n // (n - k + 1))`. 

Let's calculate the new value of `n`:

1. `i` is `n - k + 1`
2. `curr` is `n // i`, which is `n // (n - k + 1)`
3. `i * curr` is `(n - k + 1) * (n // (n - k + 1))`, which simplifies to `n` if `n` is exactly divisible by `n - k + 1`. Otherwise, it is the largest multiple of `n - k + 1` that is less than or equal to `n`.

Since `n` is initially `n - i * curr`, after the operation `n -= i * curr`, `n` becomes `0`.

The other variables (`k`, `costs`, `h`, `curr`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `2 * curr`, `curr` is `n // i` where `i` is `n - k + 1`, `i` is `n - k + 1`**.
