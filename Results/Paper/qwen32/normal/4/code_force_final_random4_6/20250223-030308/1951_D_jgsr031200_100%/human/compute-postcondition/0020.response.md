To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `i`. The loop iterates over the list `costs`, so `i` will take on the next value in the list `costs`.

Given the current state:
- `n` is 0
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}
- `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`
- `h` is `2 * curr`
- `curr` is `n // i` where `i` is `n - k + 1`
- `i` is `n - k + 1`

Since `n` is 0, the list `costs` becomes `[0 - k + 1, 1]` which simplifies to `[1 - k, 1]`.

In the previous iteration, `i` was `1 - k`. For the next iteration, `i` will take the next value from the list `costs`, which is `1`.

Let's update the state accordingly:
- `i` will be `1` for the next iteration.
- Since `i` changes, `curr` which is `n // i` will also change. Given `n` is `0`, `curr` will be `0 // 1` which is `0`.
- `h` is `2 * curr`, so `h` will be `2 * 0` which is `0`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `costs`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is 0, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `costs` is a list `[1 - k, 1]`, `h` is 0, `curr` is 0, `i` is 1**
