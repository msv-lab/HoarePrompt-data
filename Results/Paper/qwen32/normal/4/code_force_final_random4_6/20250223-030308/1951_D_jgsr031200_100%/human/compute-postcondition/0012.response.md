In the given for loop, the loop iterates over the elements in the `costs` list. The loop head only includes the variable `i`, which is used to iterate over each element in `costs`. Therefore, the state of `i` does not need to be adjusted as it is automatically assigned by the loop. However, the state of `costs` needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute.

According to the problem statement, `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`. Since the list has at least two elements, the loop will execute. Therefore, no adjustment to `costs` is necessary to ensure that the loop can execute. The states of other variables (`n`, `k`, `h`) are not relevant to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`; `h` is 0**
