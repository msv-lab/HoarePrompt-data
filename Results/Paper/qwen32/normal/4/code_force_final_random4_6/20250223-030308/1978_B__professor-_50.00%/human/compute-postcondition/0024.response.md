Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 2; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input; `_` is 1. If `b - a >= n`, the condition is satisfied as per the if part. Otherwise, the condition `b - a < n` is satisfied as per the else part.**
