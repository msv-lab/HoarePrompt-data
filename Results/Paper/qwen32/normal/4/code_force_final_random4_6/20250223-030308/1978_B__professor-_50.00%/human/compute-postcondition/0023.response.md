To determine what will be printed, let's break down the expression inside the `print` statement:

The expression is:
```
int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)
```

Let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - `(b - a) / 2`: This part calculates the average of the first and last term in the sequence from `a` to `b` (assuming `b >= a`).
   - `(b - a + 1)`: This part calculates the number of terms in the sequence from `a` to `b` (inclusive).
   - `int(...)`: This ensures that the final result is an integer.

2. **Sub-expressions**:
   - `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1)`: This part calculates the sum of an arithmetic sequence from `a` to `b` and then divides by 2.
   - `a * n`: This part multiplies the first term `a` by `n`.

3. **Combining Sub-expressions**:
   - The entire expression calculates the sum of an arithmetic sequence from `a` to `b` and then adds `a * n` to it.

However, to provide a precise description, we need to consider the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `n` which are not explicitly provided in the initial state. Therefore, we will describe the output in terms of these variables.

**Output Calculation**:
- The sum of the arithmetic sequence from `a` to `b` is given by:
  \[
  \text{Sum} = \frac{(b - a + 1) \times (a + b)}{2}
  \]
- The final expression becomes:
  \[
  \text{Output} = \text{Sum} + a \times n = \frac{(b - a + 1) \times (a + b)}{2} + a \times n
  \]

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `n` are not provided, we will describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **\(\frac{(b - a + 1) \times (a + b)}{2} + a \times n\) (where \(a\), \(b\), and \(n\) are integers obtained from the input)**
