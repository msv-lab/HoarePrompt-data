Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns under the given promotion rules. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Condition `b <= a`:** 
   - The program correctly handles the scenario where the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`. In this case, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a`.

2. **Condition `b - a >= n`:**
   - The program correctly handles the scenario where the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`. In this case, Bob should sell all buns at the modified price, and the total profit is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` down to `b - n + 1`.

3. **General Case:**
   - The program incorrectly calculates the profit for the general case where `b > a` and `b - a < n`. The formula used in the program is not correct for this scenario.

Here's the correct approach for the general case:

- Bob should sell the first `k` buns at the modified price, where the price of the `i`-th bun is `(b - i + 1)`. The profit from these `k` buns is the sum of the arithmetic series from `b` down to `b - k + 1`.
- The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
- The goal is to find the value of `k` that maximizes the total profit.

The correct formula for the sum of the first `k` terms of the modified price series is:
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{k}{2} \times (2b - k + 1) \]

The total profit is:
\[ \text{Total Profit} = \frac{k}{2} \times (2b - k + 1) + (n - k) \times a \]

To find the optimal `k`, you can iterate over possible values of `k` or use a more efficient method to determine the maximum profit.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            max_profit = 0
            for k in range(min(n, b - a + 1) + 1):
                profit = (k * (2 * b - k + 1)) // 2 + (n - k) * a
                max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
            print(max_profit)

func()
```

This corrected program will correctly compute the maximum profit for each test case.
