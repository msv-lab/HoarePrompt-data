Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. `n`, `a`, and `b` are still undefined as per the given code snippet.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if b <= a:
        print(n * a)
    elif b - a >= n:
        print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
    else:
        print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then no change is made to `a` or `b`. If `b` is greater than `a`, then the difference between `b` and `a` is either at least `n` or less than `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 2; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input. No change is made to `a` or `b` regardless of whether `b` is less than or equal to `a` or greater than `a`. The difference between `b` and `a` remains either at least `n` or less than `n` if `b` is greater than `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 2; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input; `_` is 1. If `b <= a`, the condition is satisfied as per the if part. Otherwise, if `b - a < n`, the condition is satisfied as per the else part.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
