The code snippet takes an input line, splits it into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input.**
In natural language, this means that `t` retains its initial value as the number of test cases, while `n`, `a`, and `b` are now specific integers provided in the input.
