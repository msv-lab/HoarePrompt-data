The only variable in the loop head is `q`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `ans`. If `ans` has at least one element, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is a set containing at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `ans` must still have at least one element, and `q` must be the next element in the set `ans`.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m` being greater than 0. `ans` is a set containing at least one element. `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set. `q` is the next element in the set `ans`.**
