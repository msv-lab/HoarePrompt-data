Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m` being greater than 0. `ans` is a set containing at least one element. `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`. The current value of `c` is either '1' or '?'. `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.**

In natural language: The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain the same as they were returned by `func_3()`, with `m` still being greater than 0. The set `ans` still contains at least one element. The values of `r` and `c` remain the same, where `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()` and `c` is the second value, which is either '1' or '?'. The set `temp` now includes two values: `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.
