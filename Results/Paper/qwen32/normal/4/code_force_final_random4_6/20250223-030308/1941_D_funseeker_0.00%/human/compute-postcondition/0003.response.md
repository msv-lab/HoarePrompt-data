Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing the value `x`, `r` is the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`**

In natural language: The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain as the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m` still being greater than 0. The set `ans` still contains the value `x`. Additionally, `r` and `c` are assigned the first and second values, respectively, from the string returned by `func_1()` after it is split.
