Output State: **`n`, `m` is one less than the previous value, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` is greater than 0, `ans` is an empty set, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`**

In simple terms, the variable `r` has been converted to an integer, while all other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
