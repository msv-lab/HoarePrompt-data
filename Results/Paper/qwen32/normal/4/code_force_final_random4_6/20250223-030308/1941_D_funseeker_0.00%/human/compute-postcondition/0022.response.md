Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` is greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing the values `x` and potentially other values, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`. `q` is the next element in the set `ans` that hasn't been processed yet. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains the element `((q - r) % n)` and potentially other elements based on the value of `c`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.**
