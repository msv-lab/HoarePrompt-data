You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf and Bernard decided to play a game with their friends. n people stand
in a circle and start throwing a ball to each other. They are numbered from 1
to n in the clockwise order.

Let's call a transition a movement of the ball from one player to his
neighbor. The transition can be made clockwise or counterclockwise.

Let's call the clockwise (counterclockwise) distance from player y_1 to player
y_2 the number of transitions clockwise (counterclockwise) that need to be
made to move from player y_1 to player y_2 . For example, if n=7 then the
clockwise distance from 2 to 5 is 3 , and the counterclockwise distance from 2
to 5 is 4 .

Initially, the ball is with the player number x (players are numbered
clockwise). On the i -th move the person with the ball throws it at a distance
of r_i (1 \le r_i \le n - 1 ) clockwise or counterclockwise. For example, if
there are 7 players, and the 2 nd player, after receiving the ball, throws it
a distance of 5 , then the ball will be caught by either the 7 th player
(throwing clockwise) or the 4 th player (throwing counterclockwise). An
illustration of this example is shown below.

The game was interrupted after m throws due to unexpected rain. When the rain
stopped, the guys gathered again to continue. However, no one could remember
who had the ball. As it turned out, Bernard remembered the distances for each
of the throws and the direction for some of the throws (clockwise or
counterclockwise).

Rudolf asks you to help him and based on the information from Bernard,
calculate the numbers of the players who could have the ball after m throws.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m, x (2 \le n \le
1000 , 1 \le m \le 1000 , 1 \le x \le n ) — the number of players, the number
of throws made, and the number of the player who threw the ball first,
respectively.

The next m lines contain information about each throw in order. Each of them
contains an integer r_i (1 \le r_i \le n - 1 ) — the distance at which the i
-th throw was made, and a symbol c_i , equal to '0', '1', or '?':

  * if c_i ='0', then the i -th throw was made clockwise, 
  * if c_i ='1', then the i -th throw was made counterclockwise, 
  * if c_i ='?', then Bernard does not remember the direction and the i -th throw could have been made either clockwise or counterclockwise. 

It is guaranteed that the sum n \cdot m (n multiplied by m ) over all test
cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

In the first line, output the number of players k (1 \le k \le n ) who could
have the ball at the end of the game.

In the next line, output k numbers b_i (1 \le b_i \le n ) — the numbers of the
players in increasing order. All numbers must be different.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 4 : The function calculates and prints the number of unique players who will end up with an item after `m` throws in a circular manner, starting from player `x`. It also prints the list of these unique player numbers. If player number `0` is in the result, it is replaced with player number `n`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues that can lead to incorrect results in certain cases:

1. **Handling of Modulo Operation**: In Python, the modulo operation with a negative number can result in a negative value. For example, `(q - r) % n` can result in a negative number if `q - r` is negative. To ensure the result is always a positive number between 0 and n-1, you should use `(q - r) % n` and then add `n` if the result is negative, or use `(q - r) % n` directly and ensure the result is adjusted correctly. The current implementation does not handle this correctly.

2. **Handling of Zero in the Set**: The code checks for the presence of `0` in the set `ans` and replaces it with `n`. However, this adjustment is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. The modulo operation `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` should naturally give results in the range `[0, n-1]`. If `0` is in the set, it should correspond to player `n` (the last player), but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

To fix these issues, the code should be adjusted to ensure that all calculated positions are correctly within the range `[1, n]`. Here is a corrected version of the relevant part of the code:

```python
def func_4():
    (n, m, x) = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        (r, c) = func_1().split()
        r = int(r)
        temp = set()
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                # Ensure the result is in the range [1, n]
                temp.add((q + r - 1) % n + 1)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                # Ensure the result is in the range [1, n]
                temp.add((q - r - 1) % n + 1)
        ans = temp
    # Convert the set to a sorted list and print
    print(len(ans))
    print(*sorted(ans))
```

In this corrected version, `(q + r - 1) % n + 1` and `(q - r - 1) % n + 1` ensure that the result is always in the range `[1, n]`. This should handle all edge cases correctly.
