The code snippet adds a new element to the set `temp`. The element added is the result of the expression `(q + r) % n`. Since `n`, `m`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()` and `m` is greater than 0, these values remain unchanged. The set `ans` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code snippet. The variables `r` and `c` are derived from the return value of `func_1().split()`, so they remain unchanged as well. The variable `_` is incremented by 1, but since it is not used in the code snippet provided, its value is not relevant to the output state of `temp`. The only change is that `temp`, which was initially an empty set, now contains one element, which is `(q + r) % n`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m` being greater than 0; `ans` is a set containing at least one element; `r` is the first value returned by `func_1().split()` as an integer; `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()` and `c` is either '0' or '?'; `_` is incremented by 1; `temp` is a set containing the element `(q + r) % n`.**
