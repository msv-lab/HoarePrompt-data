Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m` being greater than 0; `ans` is a set containing at least one element; `r` is the first value returned by `func_1().split()` as an integer; `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`; `_` is incremented by 1; `q` is the next element in the set `ans` after the current one. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` also contains `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is neither '0' nor '1', `temp` remains an empty set.**
