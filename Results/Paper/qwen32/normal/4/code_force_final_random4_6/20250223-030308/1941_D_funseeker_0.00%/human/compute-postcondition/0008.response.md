The code snippet adds a tuple to the `temp` set, where the tuple contains the result of `(q + r) % n`. Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `temp`, which now contains the new tuple. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing the value `x`, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `temp` is a set containing the tuple `((q + r) % n)`**.
