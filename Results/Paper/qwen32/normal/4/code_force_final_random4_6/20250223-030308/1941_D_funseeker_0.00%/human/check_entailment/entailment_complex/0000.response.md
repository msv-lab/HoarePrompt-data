### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided functions and see if they collectively solve the problem as described.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Reads a line from standard input.
   - Strips leading/trailing whitespace.
   - Returns the string.
   - **Functionality:** Correct. It reads a line of input and cleans it up.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Calls `func_1` to read a line.
   - Converts the read line to an integer.
   - Returns the integer.
   - **Functionality:** Correct. It reads a single integer from the input.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - Calls `func_1` to read a line.
   - Splits the line into parts.
   - Converts each part to an integer.
   - Returns a list of integers.
   - **Functionality:** Correct. It reads a line of integers and returns them as a list.

4. **Function `func_4`:**
   - Reads `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3`.
   - Initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - Iterates `m` times, each time reading a distance `r` and a direction `c`.
   - For each throw, updates `ans` with the possible new positions of the ball depending on the direction `c` ('0' for clockwise, '1' for counterclockwise, '?' for either).
     - If `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the clockwise position `(q + r) % n` to `temp`.
     - If `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the counterclockwise position `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.
   - Updates `ans` with the new possible positions stored in `temp`.
   - After processing all throws, checks if `0` is in `ans` and replaces it with `n`.
   - Prints the number of unique players who could have the ball.
   - Prints the list of these unique player numbers.
   - **Functionality:** Correct. It correctly processes each throw, updating the set of possible players who could have the ball after each throw, considering both possible directions when the direction is unknown. It also handles the edge case where the position `0` is replaced with `n`.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the input, processes each throw, and outputs the correct set of players who could have the ball after all throws.

**Correctness: True**
