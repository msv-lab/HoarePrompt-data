Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m` being greater than 0; `ans` is a set containing at least one element; `r` is the first value returned by `func_1().split()` as an integer; `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`; `_` is incremented by 1. If `c` is either '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the element `(q + r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.**
