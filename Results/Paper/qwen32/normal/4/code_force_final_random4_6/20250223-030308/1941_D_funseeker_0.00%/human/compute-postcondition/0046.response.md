To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and the given initial and intermediate states.

### Loop Analysis
- **Loop Head:** The loop iterates over each element `q` in the set `ans`.
- **Loop Body:**
  - If `c` is '0' or '?', it adds `(q + r) % n` to `temp`.
  - If `c` is '1' or '?', it adds `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.

### Initial Conditions
- `ans` is initially an empty set.
- `m` is greater than 0.
- `r` and `c` are derived from `func_1().split()`.
- `temp` is initially an empty set.

### Iteration Analysis
- After the first iteration, `ans` contains at least one element, and `temp` is updated based on the conditions.
- After the second iteration, `ans` contains at least two elements, and `temp` is updated based on the conditions.
- After the third iteration, `ans` contains at least three elements, and `temp` is updated based on the conditions.

### Final State
- The loop will continue to iterate over all elements in `ans`.
- The final state of `temp` will be a set containing all the computed values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans` based on the conditions.

### Output State
- `n`, `m`, and `x` remain the same as they are not modified in the loop.
- `r` and `c` remain the same as they are not modified in the loop.
- `ans` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop.
- `temp` will contain all the computed values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans` based on the conditions.

### Conclusion
The final output state is where `temp` contains all the computed values for each `q` in `ans` based on the conditions provided in the loop.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m` being greater than 0. `ans` is a set containing all the elements that were iterated over. `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`. `temp` is a set containing all the values `(q + r) % n` and, if `c` is '1' or '?', also contains the value `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans`.**
