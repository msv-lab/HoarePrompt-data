The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are positive integers, but `m` is not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, `m` remains unchanged.

Output State: **Each test case contains two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2 · 10^6). The first line of the input contains the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4). The sum of `n` and the sum of `m` over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^6. `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the two integers read from the input.**
