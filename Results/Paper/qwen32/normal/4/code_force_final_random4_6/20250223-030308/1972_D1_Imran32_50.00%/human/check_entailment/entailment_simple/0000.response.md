Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to solve a different problem than the one described. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). However, the given program does not implement this logic.

The given program instead calculates a different value, specifically:
\[ n + \sum_{i=2}^{\sqrt{n}} \left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right\rfloor \]

This formula is not related to the problem of counting pairs (a, b) that satisfy the condition given in the problem statement. The program reads the input values for n and m, but then it only uses n and ignores m. It also uses a function named `func_1` which is not correctly named according to the problem context.

Since the given program does not implement the correct algorithm to solve the problem as described, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
