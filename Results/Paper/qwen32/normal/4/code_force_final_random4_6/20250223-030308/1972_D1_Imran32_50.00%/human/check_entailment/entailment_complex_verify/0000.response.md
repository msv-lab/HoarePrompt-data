### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description Review**:
   - The problem requires counting ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Code Review**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\).
   - It initializes `ans` with \(n\).
   - It calculates a value based on \(n\) and prints it, involving a loop that sums integer divisions.

3. **Annotations Review**:
   - The annotations confirm that the function `func_1` is incorrectly using `k` instead of `m`.
   - The logic inside `func_1` is unrelated to the problem requirements, focusing on square roots and integer divisions.

4. **Original Assessment Review**:
   - The original assessment is correct in identifying the mismatch between the problem description and the code.
   - The logic inside `func_1` does not match the problem requirements.
   - The code does not iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the specified condition.

5. **Verification with Example**:
   - For the input `n = 2` and `m = 3`, the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).
   - The provided code will not produce this output because it does not correctly implement the required logic.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` is mismatched with the problem requirements, and the logic inside it is unrelated to the problem's conditions.

**Final: False**
