Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Key Observations:
- For a pair \((a, b)\) to satisfy the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\), it must be that \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for some integer \(k\).
- This simplifies to \(a = (k-1) \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Implementation Analysis:
The provided code does not seem to follow the logic derived from the problem statement. Here's what the code does:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it calls `func_1`.
- `func_1` reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(m\)).
- It initializes `ans` to \(n\).
- It calculates the square root of \(n\) and iterates from 2 to the square root of \(n\).
- For each \(i\), it calculates `cnt` as \(i^2\) and adds \((n + i) // cnt\) to `ans`.
- Finally, it prints `ans`.

### Issues with the Provided Code:
1. The function `func_1` is incorrectly reading \(k\) instead of \(m\).
2. The logic inside `func_1` does not match the problem's requirements. It seems to be implementing a different algorithm, possibly for a different problem.
3. The code does not iterate over all pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).

### Correctness:
Given the mismatch between the problem requirements and the code's logic, the provided program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
