To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `root`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(2, root + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
We know that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

The variable `root` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.

Let's summarize the adjustments:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `root` remains the same.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `ans`, `cnt`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head alone.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^6);
- `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^6);
- `ans` is `n + (n + i) // cnt + (n + (i + 1)) // (i * i + 2 * i + 1)`;
- `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`;
- `cnt` is `i * i`;
- `i` is `i + 1`

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `i + 1` (from the end of the previous iteration).
- `root` remains `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^6); `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^6); `ans` is `n + (n + i) // cnt + (n + (i + 1)) // (i * i + 2 * i + 1)`; `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`; `cnt` is `i * i`; `i` is `i + 2`**
