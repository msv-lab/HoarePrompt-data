### Reasoning:
The provided annotated program does not solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the provided program does not perform any operations related to these conditions.

Instead, the program reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(m\) based on the problem statement) and calculates a value based on \(n\) alone. It sums \(n\) and the integer division of \((n + i)\) by \((i * i)\) for each \(i\) from 2 up to the square root of \(n\) plus one. This calculation does not correspond to the problem's requirements at all.

### Correctness:
Given that the program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
