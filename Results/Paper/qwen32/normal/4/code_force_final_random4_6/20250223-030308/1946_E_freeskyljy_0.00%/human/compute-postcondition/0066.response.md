Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2`, along with two lists of distinct integers `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}` and `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}` in increasing order. For each test case, the function evaluates certain conditions and returns 0 in three specific cases. If none of these cases are met, it returns a value `ans`.**
