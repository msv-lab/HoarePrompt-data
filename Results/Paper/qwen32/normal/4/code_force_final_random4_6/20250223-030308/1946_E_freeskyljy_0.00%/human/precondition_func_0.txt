t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n, m_1, and m_2 are integers such that 1 <= m_1, m_2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The sum of all n values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1} are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= p_i <= n. s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2} are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= s_i <= n.
