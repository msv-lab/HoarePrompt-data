Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the number of permutations of length `n` given the indices of prefix and suffix maximums.
- The program should return the count of such permutations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Code Analysis:
The code processes each test case by reading `n`, `m_1`, `m_2`, `L`, and `R`. It then checks several conditions and calculates the number of valid permutations using combinatorial logic.

#### Key Conditions:
1. `if L[-1] != R[0]: return 0` - The last prefix maximum must be the first suffix maximum.
2. `if L[0] != 1 or R[0] != N: return 0` - The first prefix maximum must be at index 1 and the first suffix maximum must be at index `n`.
3. `if M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 and (L[-2] == R[1]): return 0` - If there are more than one prefix and suffix maximums, the second last prefix maximum should not be the second suffix maximum.

#### Calculation:
- `ans = math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` - This calculates the number of ways to choose positions for the maximum elements.
- The code then iterates through the prefix and suffix maximums, adjusting `ans` by multiplying with the number of valid positions for other elements.

### Function Summary Recap:
The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, checks specific conditions, and calculates the number of valid permutations using combinatorial logic.

### Original Assessment Recap:
The original assessment claims the program is incorrect due to not handling certain edge cases, specifically a test case with multiple prefix and suffix maximums.

### Detailed Reasoning:
Let's revisit the specific test case mentioned in the original assessment:

#### Test Case:
```
1
4 2 2
1 3
2 4
```

- **Prefix Maximums**: `[1, 3]` (Indices 1 and 3)
- **Suffix Maximums**: `[2, 4]` (Indices 2 and 4)

**Analysis**:
- The last prefix maximum (index 3) is not the first suffix maximum (index 2), so the condition `if L[-1] != R[0]: return 0` is triggered, and the function returns `0`.

**Correctness**:
- The test case `[3, 4, 2, 1]` indeed satisfies the conditions, but the program fails to identify it because of the condition `if L[-1] != R[0]: return 0`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the last prefix maximum is not the first suffix maximum, which is a valid case in the problem description.

**Final Evaluation**:
Final: **False**
