### Reasoning:

The program follows a structured approach to determine the number of permutations that satisfy the given prefix and suffix maximum conditions. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Initial Checks:**
   - The first condition `L[-1] != R[0]` ensures that the last prefix maximum is the same as the first suffix maximum. This is necessary because the maximum element in the permutation must be both a prefix maximum and a suffix maximum.
   - The second condition `L[0] != 1 or R[0] != N` ensures that the first prefix maximum is at the start (index 1) and the first suffix maximum is at the end (index N). This is because the maximum element (N) must be at the start to be a prefix maximum and at the end to be a suffix maximum.
   - The third condition `M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 and (L[-2] == R[1])` ensures that the second last prefix maximum is not the same as the second suffix maximum. This is to avoid a conflict where the second maximum element could be incorrectly placed.

2. **Combinatorial Calculation:**
   - The initial combinatorial value `ans` is calculated using `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. This represents the number of ways to choose `L[-1] - 1` elements from the first `N - 1` elements to form the prefix up to the last prefix maximum.
   - The program then iterates backward from `L[-1] - 1` to 1, adjusting `ans` by multiplying it with the number of remaining elements that can be placed in the current position, taking care to skip positions that are prefix maxima.
   - Similarly, the program iterates forward from `R[0] + 1` to `N`, adjusting `ans` by multiplying it with the number of remaining elements that can be placed in the current position, taking care to skip positions that are suffix maxima.

3. **Modulo Operation:**
   - All calculations are performed modulo `10^9 + 7` to handle large numbers, as required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of permutations that satisfy the given prefix and suffix maximum conditions. It handles all edge cases and performs the necessary combinatorial calculations. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Your response:
