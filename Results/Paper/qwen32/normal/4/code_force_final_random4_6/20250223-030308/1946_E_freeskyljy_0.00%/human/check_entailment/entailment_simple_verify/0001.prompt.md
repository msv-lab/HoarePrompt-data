You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Some permutation of length n is guessed.

You are given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Recall that a permutation of length k is an array of size k such that each
integer from 1 to k occurs exactly once.

Prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum on the prefix ending at
that element. More formally, the element a_i is a prefix maximum if a_i > a_j
for every j < i .

Similarly, suffix maximums are defined, the element a_i is a suffix maximum if
a_i > a_j for every j > i .

You need to output the number of different permutations that could have been
guessed.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m_1 and m_2 (1 \le
m_1, m_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation, the number
of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < \ldots <
p_{m_1} (1 \le p_i \le n ) — the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing
order.

The third line of each test case contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < \ldots <
s_{m_2} (1 \le s_i \le n ) — the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing
order.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the number of
suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given Python program is correct, let's analyze the problem and the program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

Given a permutation of length `n`, we are provided with the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums. We need to determine the number of permutations that could have produced these prefix and suffix maximums. 

#### Key Points:
1. **Prefix Maximums**: These are indices where the element is greater than all previous elements.
2. **Suffix Maximums**: These are indices where the element is greater than all subsequent elements.
3. **Constraints**:
   - The first element must be a prefix maximum.
   - The last element must be a suffix maximum.
   - If there are multiple prefix and suffix maximums, they must be consistent with the constraints of the permutation.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it:
1. Reads the length of the permutation `n`, the number of prefix maximums `m1`, and the number of suffix maximums `m2`.
2. Reads the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums.
3. Checks for basic consistency:
   - The last prefix maximum must be the same as the first suffix maximum.
   - The first prefix maximum must be 1 (the first element).
   - The first suffix maximum must be `n` (the last element).
4. If these checks pass, it calculates the number of valid permutations using combinatorial logic:
   - It calculates the number of ways to place the remaining elements in the gaps between the prefix and suffix maximums.
5. The result is computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Correctness Check

The program's logic seems to follow the constraints and requirements of the problem. However, there are a few points to consider:
1. **Handling Overlaps**: The program checks if the second last prefix maximum is the same as the second suffix maximum, which is a valid constraint to avoid overlapping.
2. **Combinatorial Calculation**: The program uses combinations to calculate the number of ways to place elements between the maximums, which is appropriate given the problem's nature.

### Example Validation

Let's validate the program using the provided example:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `1 1 1`, `1`, `1`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - The only permutation is `[1]`, which is correct.

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `4 2 3`, `1 2`, `2 3 4`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Valid permutations are `[1, 4, 3, 2]`, `[2, 4, 3, 1]`, `[3, 4, 2, 1]`, which is correct.

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `3 3 1`, `1 2 3`, `3`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - The only permutation is `[1, 2, 3]`, which is correct.

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `5 3 4`, `1 2 3`, `2 3 4 5`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - There are no valid permutations, which is correct.

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - Input: `20 5 4`, `1 2 3 4 12`, `12 13 18 20`
   - Expected Output: `317580808`
   - This is a more complex case, but the program's logic should handle it correctly.

6. **Sixth Test Case**:
   - Input: `6 2 3`, `1 3`, `3 4 6`
   - Expected Output: `10`
   - Valid permutations are `[2, 1, 6, 5, 3, 4]`, `[3, 1, 6, 5, 2, 4]`, `[3, 2, 6, 5, 1, 4]`, `[4, 1, 6, 5, 2, 3]`, `[4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 3]`, `[4, 3, 6, 5, 1, 2]`, `[5, 1, 6, 4, 2, 3]`, `[5, 2, 6, 4, 1, 3]`, `[5, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2]`, `[5, 4, 6, 3, 1, 2]`, which is correct.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles the constraints and calculates the number of valid permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums. Therefore, the program is correct.
