The code snippet provided is `i -= 1`, which decrements the value of `i` by 1. According to the initial state, `i` is `L[-1] - 2`. Therefore, after the decrement, `i` will be `L[-1] - 3`.

No other variables are affected by this operation. The conditions and the values of `t`, `n`, `m_1`, `m_2`, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}`, `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}`, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, `cur`, `nums_left`, `ans`, and `MOD` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2` are integers such that 1 <= m_1, m_2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= p_i <= n, `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= s_i <= n, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are assigned the values from the input, `L` is a list of integers read from the input, `R` is a list of integers read from the input, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, `L[0]` is equal to 1, `R[0]` is equal to `N`, at least one of the following conditions is true: `M1` is not greater than 1, `M2` is not greater than 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`, `M1` is greater than 1, `cur` is `M1 - 3` if `i` equals `L[cur]`, otherwise `cur` remains `M1 - 2`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`, `i` is `L[-1] - 3`, and `L[-1]` must be greater than or equal to 4. If `i` is equal to `L[cur]`, then `cur` is updated to `M1 - 3`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `(ans * (nums_left + 1)) % MOD`.**
