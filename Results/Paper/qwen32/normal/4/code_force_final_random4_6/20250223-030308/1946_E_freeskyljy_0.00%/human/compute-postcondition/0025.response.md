The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `L[-1] - 2` and `L[-1]` must be greater than 2. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be greater than 1. Therefore, `L[-1]` must be at least 3 to ensure `i` is at least 1. However, since `i` must be greater than 1, `L[-1]` must be at least 4 to ensure `i` is at least 2.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2` are integers such that 1 <= m_1, m_2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= p_i <= n, `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= s_i <= n, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are assigned the values from the input, `L` is a list of integers read from the input, `R` is a list of integers read from the input, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, `L[0]` is equal to 1, `R[0]` is equal to `N`, at least one of the following conditions is true: `M1` is not greater than 1, `M2` is not greater than 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`, `M1` is greater than 1, `cur` is `M1 - 2`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 3`, `i` is `L[-1] - 2` and `L[-1]` must be greater than or equal to 4. If `i` is equal to `L[cur]`, then `cur` is updated to `M1 - 3`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `(ans * (nums_left + 1)) % MOD`.**
