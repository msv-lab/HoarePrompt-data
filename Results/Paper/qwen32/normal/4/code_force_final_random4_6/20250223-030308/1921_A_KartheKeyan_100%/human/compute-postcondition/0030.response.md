The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range `4`. Therefore, only `i` can be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1. Since the loop runs for `i` in the range of 4 (i.e., `i` will take values 0, 1, 2, 3), for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` must be a non-zero integer
- `coord` is a list containing two tuples `((x1, y1), (x, y))`
- `res` is 0
- `i` is 1
- `p1` is undefined
- `p2` is undefined
- `x` and `y` are the new input integers

For the next iteration, `i` should be 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` must be a non-zero integer, `coord` is a list containing two tuples `((x1, y1), (x, y))`, `res` is 0, `i` is 2, `p1` is undefined, `p2` is undefined, `x` and `y` are the new input integers**
