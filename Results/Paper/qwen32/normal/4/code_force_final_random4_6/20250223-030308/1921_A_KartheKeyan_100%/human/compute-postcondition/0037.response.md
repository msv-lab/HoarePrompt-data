Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be a non-zero integer; `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples `((x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4))`; `res` is `math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)`; `i` is 3; `p1` is \((coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])^2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1])^2\); `p2` is \((coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])^2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1])^2\); `x` and `y` are the new input integers.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to be the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`. All other variables retain their initial values.
