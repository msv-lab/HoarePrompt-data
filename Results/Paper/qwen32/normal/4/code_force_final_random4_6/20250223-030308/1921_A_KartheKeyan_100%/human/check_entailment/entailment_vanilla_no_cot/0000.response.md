Correctness: **False**

The given program attempts to calculate the area of a square but contains a logical error in the calculation of the side length. Specifically, the program calculates the squared distance between two adjacent points and then multiplies the square roots of these distances, which is incorrect. Instead, it should calculate the distance between two adjacent points and square that distance to get the area.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        coord = sorted(coord)
        # Calculate the distance between two adjacent points
        side_length = math.sqrt((coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2)
        # The area is the side length squared
        area = side_length ** 2
        print(int(area))
        n -= 1

func()
```

In this corrected version, the program calculates the distance between two adjacent points (which is the side length of the square) and then squares this distance to get the area. This should provide the correct output for the given problem.
