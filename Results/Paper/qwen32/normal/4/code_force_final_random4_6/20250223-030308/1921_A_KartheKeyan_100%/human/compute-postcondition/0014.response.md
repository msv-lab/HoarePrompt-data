Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be a non-zero integer; `coord` is a list containing four tuples `((x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4))`; `res` is 0; `i` is 3**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all four iterations, the variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, and `n` remains a non-zero integer. The list `coord` will contain four tuples, each representing a pair of integers `(x, y)` that were input during each iteration of the loop. The variable `res` remains 0, and the loop variable `i` will be 3, indicating that the loop has completed its fourth and final iteration.
