Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is a non-zero integer; `coord` is [(x, y)] with the new tuple `(x, y)` appended; `res` is 0; `i` is 1; `p1` is \((coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])^2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1])^2\) if `coord` has at least 2 elements, otherwise `p1` remains unchanged; `p2` is \((coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])^2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1])^2\) if `coord` has at least 4 elements, otherwise `p2` remains unchanged; `x` and `y` are the new input integers.**

Explanation: The `coord` list now includes the new tuple `(x, y)`. The values of `t`, `n`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `p1` and `p2` are recalculated if the conditions for their computation are met (i.e., `coord` has at least 2 elements for `p1` and at least 4 elements for `p2`).
