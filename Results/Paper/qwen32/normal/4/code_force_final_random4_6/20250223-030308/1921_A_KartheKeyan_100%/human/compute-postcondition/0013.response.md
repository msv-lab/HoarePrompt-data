The code appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Therefore, the list `coord` will now contain three tuples instead of two. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be a non-zero integer; `coord` is a list containing three tuples `((x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x, y))`; `res` is 0; `x` and `y` are the new integer inputs from the user; `i` is 2**.
