The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of the input provided. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. The initial condition that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100 still holds true.
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an input integer.**
