Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is a non-zero integer; `coord` is [(x, y)] with the new tuple `(x, y)` appended; `res` is 0; `i` is 2; `p1` is \((coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])^2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1])^2\) if `coord` has at least 2 elements, otherwise `p1` remains unchanged; `p2` is \((coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])^2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1])^2\) if `coord` has at least 4 elements, otherwise `p2` remains unchanged; `x` and `y` are the new input integers.**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. The values of `t`, `n`, `res`, `i`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged. The new tuple `(x, y)` is added to the end of the `coord` list, so `coord` now includes this additional element.
