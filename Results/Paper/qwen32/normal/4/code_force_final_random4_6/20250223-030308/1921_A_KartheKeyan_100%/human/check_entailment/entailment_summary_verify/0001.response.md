Let's carefully analyze the program and the provided function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
- We need to find the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners.
- The square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.
- The input consists of multiple test cases.
- For each test case, we are given four lines with two integers each, representing the coordinates of the square's corners.
- The output should be the area of the square for each test case.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads four lines of input, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of the square's corners. These coordinates are stored in the list `coord`.

2. **Sorting Coordinates:**
   - The coordinates are sorted. Sorting the coordinates helps in easily identifying pairs of adjacent sides of the square.

3. **Calculating Side Lengths:**
   - The program calculates the squared distance between the first two sorted points `p1` and between the last two sorted points `p2`. These distances represent the squared lengths of two adjacent sides of the square.
   - The side length of the square is then calculated as the square root of either `p1` or `p2` since both should be equal (sides of a square are equal).

4. **Calculating Area:**
   - The program calculates the area using the square root of the product of `p1` and `p2`, which is incorrect. It should use the square root of either `p1` or `p2` to get the side length of the square.
   - The correct formula for the area should be `side_length ** 2`, where `side_length = math.sqrt(p1)` or `math.sqrt(p2)`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Calculation of Side Lengths:**
  - The program calculates the area using the square root of the product of `p1` and `p2`, which is incorrect. It should use the square root of either `p1` or `p2` to get the side length of the square.
  - The correct formula for the area should be:
    ```python
    side_length = math.sqrt(p1)  # or math.sqrt(p2), since they should be equal
    area = side_length ** 2
    print(round(area))
    ```

### Corrected Calculation:
- The corrected calculation should be:
  ```python
  side_length = math.sqrt(p1)  # or math.sqrt(p2), since they should be equal
  area = side_length ** 2
  print(round(area))
  ```

### Conclusion:
The given program has an incorrect formula for calculating the area of the square. It should calculate the side length using the square root of either `p1` or `p2` and then square it to get the area.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the program is incorrect due to the wrong formula for calculating the area of the square. The program calculates the area using the square root of the product of `p1` and `p2`, which is incorrect. Instead, it should use the square root of either `p1` or `p2` to get the side length and then square it to find the area.

Final: **False**
