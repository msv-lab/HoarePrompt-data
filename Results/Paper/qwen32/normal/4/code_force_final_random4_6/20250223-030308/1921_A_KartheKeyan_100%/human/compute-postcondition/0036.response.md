The code snippet reassigns `p2` with the same expression it was initially assigned: \((coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])^2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1])^2\). Since the expression does not change, the value of `p2` remains the same. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be a non-zero integer; `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples `((x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4))`; `res` is 0; `i` is 3; `p1` is \((coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])^2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1])^2\); `p2` is \((coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])^2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1])^2\); `x` and `y` are the new input integers.**
