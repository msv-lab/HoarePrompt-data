To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `removals`.

Given:
- `removals` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `negatives` is a non-negative integer.
- `elements` is a list of integers.
- `pos` is a list containing two elements `[s - 2 * n, s - 2 * n]`.
- `s` is the sum of the elements in `elements` minus `elements[-i]`.
- If `negatives + i` is within the bounds of `elements`, `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements` plus `elements[-(negatives + i)]` minus `elements[-i]`.
- If `negatives + i` is out of bounds, `n` is 0.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, removals + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, to start the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value. The value of `removals` remains unchanged as it defines the upper bound of the loop.

Let's summarize the state adjustments:
- `i` was 1 at the start of the first iteration and has been incremented by 1 after each iteration. So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `removals` remains the same.

State: **`removals` must be greater than or equal to 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing two elements `[s - 2 * n, s - 2 * n]`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `elements` minus `elements[-i]`. If `negatives + i` is within the bounds of `elements`, `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements` plus `elements[-(negatives + i)]` minus `elements[-i]`. If `negatives + i` is out of bounds, `n` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since `i` was the loop variable and has been incremented by 1 after the previous iteration, we need to reflect that in the state.

State: **`removals` must be greater than or equal to 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing two elements `[s - 2 * n, s - 2 * n]`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `elements` minus `elements[-(i+1)]`. If `negatives + (i+1)` is within the bounds of `elements`, `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements` plus `elements[-(negatives + (i+1))]` minus `elements[-(i+1)]`. If `negatives + (i+1)` is out of bounds, `n` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`**

However, to strictly adhere to the format and only adjust the loop head variables, we get:

State: **`removals` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`**

But since we need to reflect the changes in `s` and `n` as well based on the new `i`, the most accurate state representation considering the loop head and derived variables would be:

State: **`removals` must be greater than or equal to 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is recalculated as `[s - 2 * n, s - 2 * n]` where `s` is the sum of the elements in `elements` minus `elements[-(i+1)]`. If `negatives + (i+1)` is within the bounds of `elements`, `n` is recalculated as the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements` plus `elements[-(negatives + (i+1))]` minus `elements[-(i+1)]`. If `negatives + (i+1)` is out of bounds, `n` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`**

Given the constraints of only adjusting the loop head variables, the final state considering only `i` and `removals` is:

State: **`removals` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`**
