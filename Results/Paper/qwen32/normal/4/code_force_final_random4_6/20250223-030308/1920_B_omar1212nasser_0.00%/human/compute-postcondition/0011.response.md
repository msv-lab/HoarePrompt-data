The `IndexError` could occur at `n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` if the index `-(negatives + i)` is out of bounds for the list `elements`. This would happen if `negatives + i` is greater than the length of the list `elements`.

If no `IndexError` occurs, `n` is updated to be the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements` plus `elements[-(negatives + i)]` minus `elements[-i]`.

If an `IndexError` does occur, `n` is set to 0.

Therefore, after the complete execution of the `try` statement, the output state is:
Output State: **`removals` must be greater than or equal to 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing one element `s - 2 * n`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `elements` minus `elements[-i]`. If `negatives + i` is within the bounds of `elements`, `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements` plus `elements[-(negatives + i)]` minus `elements[-i]`. If `negatives + i` is out of bounds, `n` is 0.**
