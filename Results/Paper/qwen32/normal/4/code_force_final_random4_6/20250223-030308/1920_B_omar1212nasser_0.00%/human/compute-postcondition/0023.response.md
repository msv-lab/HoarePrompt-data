The `IndexError` might be triggered at `n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` if the index `-(negatives + i)` or `-i` is out of bounds for the list `elements`. This could happen if `negatives + i` or `i` is larger than the length of `elements`, leading to an attempt to access an index that does not exist in the list.

Summarizing the try-except statement:
- If no `IndexError` occurs, `n` is incremented by the difference between `elements[-(negatives + i)]` and `elements[-i]`.
- If an `IndexError` occurs, `n` is set to 0.

Therefore, the final output state is:
Output State: **`removals` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 2`, `s` is decreased by `elements[-i]`. If no `IndexError` occurs, `n` is incremented by `elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]`; otherwise, `n` is 0.**
