Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by simulating the optimal moves of both Alice and Bob. However, there are several issues and inconsistencies in the implementation that need to be addressed.

1. **Hardcoded Condition in `func_2`**: The function `func_2` has a hardcoded condition that if `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3, it returns 0. This is incorrect and does not reflect the optimal strategy for the game. This hardcoded condition is not based on any logical game strategy and will lead to incorrect results for these specific values of `removals` and `negatives`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Negatives**: The function `func_2` attempts to handle the negation of elements by maintaining a sum `n` of the last `negatives + removals` elements and adjusting it as elements are removed. However, this approach does not correctly account for the optimal way to negate elements to minimize the sum. Specifically, it assumes that negating the largest possible number of elements from the end of the list is optimal, which is not necessarily true. The optimal strategy involves considering the smallest elements (after removals) for negation.

3. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**: The calculation of the sum `s` and the adjustment of `n` do not correctly reflect the optimal strategy. The sum `s` is supposed to be the sum of the remaining elements after removals, and `n` should be the sum of the elements that Bob negates. The current implementation does not correctly adjust `n` when elements are removed and negated.

4. **Lack of Proper Strategy**: The current implementation does not consider the optimal strategy for both players. Alice should aim to remove the largest elements to maximize the sum, and Bob should aim to negate the smallest elements (after removals) to minimize the sum. The current implementation does not correctly simulate this strategy.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is False.

Correctness: **False**
