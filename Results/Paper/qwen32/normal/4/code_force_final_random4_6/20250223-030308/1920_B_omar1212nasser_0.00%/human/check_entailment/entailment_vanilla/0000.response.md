Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x`, and then reads the list of `n` integers `a`.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The program sorts the array `a` in ascending order.

3. **Core Logic (func_2):**
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to compute the optimal sum after Alice and Bob's moves.
   - The function first checks for a special case where `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3`, returning `0` in this case. This is incorrect and does not generalize to all possible inputs.
   - It initializes an empty list `pos` and calculates the sum `s` of all elements.
   - It calculates the sum `n` of the last `negatives` elements (which are the largest elements after sorting).
   - It appends `s - 2 * n` to `pos`. This represents the sum if Alice removes no elements and Bob negates the `negatives` largest elements.
   - The function then iterates over possible numbers of elements Alice can remove (from 1 to `removals`):
     - It subtracts the `i`-th largest element from `s`.
     - It tries to add the next largest element that Bob can negate and subtract the `i`-th largest element from `n`. If an `IndexError` occurs, it sets `n` to `0`.
     - It appends `s - 2 * n` to `pos` for each iteration.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value in `pos`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Special Case Handling:**
   - The function `func_2` has a hardcoded special case for `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3`, which is not a general solution and is incorrect.

2. **Logic for Negation:**
   - The logic for handling Bob's negation is flawed. The program tries to add the next largest element that Bob can negate, but it doesn't correctly account for the number of negations Bob can perform. It should consider the smallest elements for negation after Alice's removals.

3. **General Strategy:**
   - The general strategy should involve removing the smallest elements first (Alice's move) and then negating the smallest remaining elements (Bob's move). The current logic does not correctly implement this strategy.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
