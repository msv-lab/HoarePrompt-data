The code appends the value of `s - 2 * n` to the list `pos`. The values of `removals`, `i`, `s`, and `n` are not changed by this line of code. 

Output State: **`removals` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 2`, `s` is decreased by `elements[-i]`, `n` is incremented by `elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` if no `IndexError` occurs, otherwise `n` is 0, `pos` has an additional element `s - 2 * n`.**
