The code snippet provided is `s -= elements[-i]`. This means that the variable `s` will be updated by subtracting the `i`-th element from the end of the list `elements` from it.

Given the initial state:
- `removals` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `negatives` is a non-negative integer
- `elements` is a list of integers
- `pos` is a list containing one element `s - 2 * n`
- `s` is the sum of the elements in `elements`
- `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements`

The value of `s` will be updated to `s - elements[-i]` after the execution of the code snippet. The variables `removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, `pos`, and `n` remain unchanged unless `i` is specifically related to `negatives` or affects the calculation of `n`.

Output State: **`removals` must be greater than or equal to 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing one element `s - 2 * n`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `elements` minus `elements[-i]`, `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements`.**
