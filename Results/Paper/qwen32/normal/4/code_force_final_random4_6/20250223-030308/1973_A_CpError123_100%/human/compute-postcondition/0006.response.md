Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input. If the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, the program does not execute the else part and continues with the next statement after the if-else block.**
