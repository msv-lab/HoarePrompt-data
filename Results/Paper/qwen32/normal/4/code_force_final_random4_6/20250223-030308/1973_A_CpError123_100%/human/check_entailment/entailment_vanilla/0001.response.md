To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic and constraints of the problem and compare it with the provided solution.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Game Scoring**:
   - A win gives 2 points.
   - A draw gives 1 point to each player.
   - The total points among all players must be even because each game contributes either 2 points (in case of a win) or 2 points (in case of a draw).

2. **Constraints**:
   - The scores are sorted in non-decreasing order: \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).
   - The scores are integers between 0 and 30.

3. **Objective**:
   - Determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened.
   - If the scores are inconsistent with any valid set of games, return -1.

### Solution Analysis:

The provided program follows these steps:

1. **Check Total Points Evenness**:
   - The total points \( p_1 + p_2 + p_3 \) must be even. If not, it's impossible to have a valid set of games, and the program correctly returns -1.

2. **Calculate Maximum Possible Draws**:
   - The maximum number of draws can be calculated using the formula \( \text{min} \left( \frac{p_1 + p_2 + p_3}{2}, p_1 + p_2 \right) \).
   - The term \( \frac{p_1 + p_2 + p_3}{2} \) represents the total number of games (since each game contributes 2 points).
   - The term \( p_1 + p_2 \) represents the maximum number of draws involving the first two players, as the third player's score is at least as high as the second player's score.

### Validation with Examples:

Let's validate the program with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `0 0 0`
   - Total points: 0 (even)
   - Maximum draws: \( \text{min} \left( \frac{0}{2}, 0 \right) = 0 \)
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `0 1 1`
   - Total points: 2 (even)
   - Maximum draws: \( \text{min} \left( \frac{2}{2}, 1 \right) = 1 \)
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `1 1 1`
   - Total points: 3 (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input: `1 1 2`
   - Total points: 4 (even)
   - Maximum draws: \( \text{min} \left( \frac{4}{2}, 2 \right) = 2 \)
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Example 5**:
   - Input: `3 3 3`
   - Total points: 9 (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

6. **Example 6**:
   - Input: `3 4 5`
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - Maximum draws: \( \text{min} \left( \frac{12}{2}, 7 \right) = 6 \)
   - Output: `6` (Correct)

7. **Example 7**:
   - Input: `1 1 10`
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - Maximum draws: \( \text{min} \left( \frac{12}{2}, 2 \right) = 2 \)
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or identify inconsistent scores. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
