Output State: **`t` is an input integer, Each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of an integer input, which represents the number of test cases. The conditions and constraints on the test cases themselves (the scores of the players) remain unchanged.
