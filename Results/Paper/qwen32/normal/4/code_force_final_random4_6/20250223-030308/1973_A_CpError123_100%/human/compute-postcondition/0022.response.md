Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2; `_` is 1; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the new input; `x` is `(a + b + c) // 2` (using the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c`); `y` is `a + b` (using the new values of `a` and `b`). If `(a + b + c) % 2 != 0`, then `x` and `y` are updated using the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. Otherwise, `x` and `y` retain their values based on the old values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.**
