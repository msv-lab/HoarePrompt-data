Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input; `x` is `(a + b + c) // 2`. If the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, the program does not execute the else part and continues with the next statement after the if-else block.**

In simple terms, the value of `x` is calculated as the integer division of the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` by 2. The conditions on `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.
