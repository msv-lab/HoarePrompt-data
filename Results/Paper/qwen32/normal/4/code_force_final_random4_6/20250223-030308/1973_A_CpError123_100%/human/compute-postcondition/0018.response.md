The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is the iteration counter. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is the current iteration counter, and `t` is the total number of iterations.

To execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `_` is the next iteration counter, so `_` is incremented by 1; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input; `x` is `(a + b + c) // 2`; `y` is `a + b`.**

Since only the state of `_` in the loop head needs to be adjusted:
State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `_` is incremented by 1; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input; `x` is `(a + b + c) // 2`; `y` is `a + b`.**

To be more precise, if `_` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it should now be 1 for the next iteration to start:
State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2; `_` is 1; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input; `x` is `(a + b + c) // 2`; `y` is `a + b`.**
