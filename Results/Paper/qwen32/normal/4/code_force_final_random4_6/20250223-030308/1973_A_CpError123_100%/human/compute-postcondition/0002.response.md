The code snippet reads three integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state does not provide specific values for `a`, `b`, and `c`, but it does indicate that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1. This precondition is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input.**
