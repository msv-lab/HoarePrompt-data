Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three chess players, or to determine if the scores are inconsistent with any valid set of games and results.

### Key Observations

1. **Total Points Calculation**: In any game, the total points awarded are 2 (if there is a winner and a loser) or 2 (if it's a draw). Therefore, the sum of the scores of all three players must be even.

2. **Maximum Draws**: The maximum number of draws is limited by the total points and the distribution of points among the players. If we denote the scores of the players as \(a \leq b \leq c\), then the maximum number of draws can be thought of as the number of games that could have ended in a draw, which is constrained by the total points.

### Program Analysis

Let's go through the program:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the scores of the three players. This part is correct.

2. **Checking Total Points**: The program checks if the sum of the scores is even. If not, it prints `-1` because the scores cannot be the result of a valid set of games. This is correct.

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws**:
   - `x = (a + b + c) // 2`: This calculates the total number of games played, since each game contributes 2 points.
   - `y = a + b`: This is the sum of the scores of the two players with the lowest scores.
   - `print(min(x, y))`: The maximum number of draws is the minimum of the total number of games and the sum of the scores of the two players with the lowest scores. This is because the maximum number of draws is limited by the points that the two players with the lowest scores could have earned.

### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Input**: `0 0 0`
   - Total points: `0` (even)
   - `x = 0`, `y = 0`
   - Maximum draws: `0`
   - Output: `0` (correct)

2. **Input**: `0 1 1`
   - Total points: `2` (even)
   - `x = 1`, `y = 1`
   - Maximum draws: `1`
   - Output: `1` (correct)

3. **Input**: `1 1 1`
   - Total points: `3` (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (correct)

4. **Input**: `1 1 2`
   - Total points: `4` (even)
   - `x = 2`, `y = 2`
   - Maximum draws: `2`
   - Output: `2` (correct)

5. **Input**: `3 3 3`
   - Total points: `9` (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (correct)

6. **Input**: `3 4 5`
   - Total points: `12` (even)
   - `x = 6`, `y = 7`
   - Maximum draws: `6`
   - Output: `6` (correct)

7. **Input**: `1 1 10`
   - Total points: `12` (even)
   - `x = 6`, `y = 2`
   - Maximum draws: `2`
   - Output: `2` (correct)

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all the given examples and adheres to the logic derived from the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
