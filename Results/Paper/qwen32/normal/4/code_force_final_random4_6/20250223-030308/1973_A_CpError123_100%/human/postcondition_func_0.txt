The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three sorted integer scores. For each test case, it checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the function outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates two values: half the sum of the scores and the sum of the first two scores, then outputs the smaller of these two values.
