You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        y = a + b
        print(min(x, y))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        
        y = a + b
        
        print(min(x, y))
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial number of test cases. For each test case, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. If the sum `(a + b + c)` is odd, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2` and `y` as `a + b`, then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic and constraints of the problem and compare it with the provided solution.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Game Scoring**:
   - A win gives 2 points.
   - A draw gives 1 point to each player.
   - The total points among all players must be even because each game contributes either 2 points (in case of a win) or 2 points (in case of a draw).

2. **Constraints**:
   - The scores are sorted in non-decreasing order: \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).
   - The scores are integers between 0 and 30.

3. **Objective**:
   - Determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened.
   - If the scores are inconsistent with any valid set of games, return -1.

### Solution Analysis:

The provided program follows these steps:

1. **Check Total Points Evenness**:
   - The total points \( p_1 + p_2 + p_3 \) must be even. If not, it's impossible to have a valid set of games, and the program correctly returns -1.

2. **Calculate Maximum Possible Draws**:
   - The maximum number of draws can be calculated using the formula \( \text{min} \left( \frac{p_1 + p_2 + p_3}{2}, p_1 + p_2 \right) \).
   - The term \( \frac{p_1 + p_2 + p_3}{2} \) represents the total number of games (since each game contributes 2 points).
   - The term \( p_1 + p_2 \) represents the maximum number of draws involving the first two players, as the third player's score is at least as high as the second player's score.

### Validation with Examples:

Let's validate the program with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `0 0 0`
   - Total points: 0 (even)
   - Maximum draws: \( \text{min} \left( \frac{0}{2}, 0 \right) = 0 \)
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `0 1 1`
   - Total points: 2 (even)
   - Maximum draws: \( \text{min} \left( \frac{2}{2}, 1 \right) = 1 \)
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `1 1 1`
   - Total points: 3 (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input: `1 1 2`
   - Total points: 4 (even)
   - Maximum draws: \( \text{min} \left( \frac{4}{2}, 2 \right) = 2 \)
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Example 5**:
   - Input: `3 3 3`
   - Total points: 9 (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

6. **Example 6**:
   - Input: `3 4 5`
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - Maximum draws: \( \text{min} \left( \frac{12}{2}, 7 \right) = 6 \)
   - Output: `6` (Correct)

7. **Example 7**:
   - Input: `1 1 10`
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - Maximum draws: \( \text{min} \left( \frac{12}{2}, 2 \right) = 2 \)
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or identify inconsistent scores. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
