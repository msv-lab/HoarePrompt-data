You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        y = a + b
        print(min(x, y))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.

        y = a + b
        
        print(min(x, y))
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial number of test cases. For each test case, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. If the sum `(a + b + c)` is odd, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2` and `y` as `a + b`, then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the logic and identify a potential issue.

The program calculates the total number of games played as `(a + b + c) // 2` because each game contributes either 2 points (in case of a win/loss) or 2 points (in case of a draw). Then, it calculates the maximum possible number of draws as `min(x, y)`, where `x` is the total number of games and `y` is the sum of the two lower scores.

However, the logic does not correctly account for the possibility of all games being win/loss and not allowing for the maximum number of draws. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the scores can be achieved through a valid combination of wins, losses, and draws.

Let's consider the test case `1 1 10`:
- The total points are `1 + 1 + 10 = 12`, which means `6` games were played.
- The sum of the two lower scores is `1 + 1 = 2`.
- The program outputs `min(6, 2) = 2`.

However, it is impossible to achieve the scores `1 1 10` with only 2 draws. Let's see why:
- If there are 2 draws, that accounts for `4` points (2 points per draw).
- The remaining `8` points must come from wins and losses.
- For the scores to be `1 1 10`, the player with `10` points must have won `5` games (since `5 * 2 = 10` points).
- But if one player won `5` games, the other two players must have lost `5` games in total, which contradicts the scores `1 1 10` because the other two players can only have `1` point each.

Thus, the correct output for `1 1 10` should be `-1`, indicating that these scores are not possible. The provided program does not handle this case correctly and outputs `2` instead of `-1`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
