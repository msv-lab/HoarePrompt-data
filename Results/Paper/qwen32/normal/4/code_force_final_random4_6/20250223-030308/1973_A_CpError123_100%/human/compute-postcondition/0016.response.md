Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `_` is the next iteration counter; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input; `x` is `(a + b + c) // 2`; `y` is `a + b`.**

In simple terms, the value of `y` has been updated to be the sum of `a` and `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
