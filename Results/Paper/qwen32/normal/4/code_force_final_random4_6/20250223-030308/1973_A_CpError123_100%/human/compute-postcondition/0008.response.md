The code assigns the value of `a + b` to the variable `y`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `x` remain unchanged. Specifically, `t` is still greater than or equal to 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers provided by the input, and `x` is still calculated as `(a + b + c) // 2`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input; `x` is `(a + b + c) // 2`; `y` is `a + b`.**
