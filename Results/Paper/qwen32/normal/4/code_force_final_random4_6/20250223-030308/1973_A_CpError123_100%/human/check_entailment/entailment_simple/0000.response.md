### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the program, let's analyze its logic step-by-step:

1. **Input Validation**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the scores of the three players. The scores are guaranteed to be sorted in non-decreasing order, i.e., `a ≤ b ≤ c`.

2. **Odd Sum Check**: The program checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1`. This is because in each game, the total points awarded (either 2 for a win-lose scenario or 2 for a draw) must be even. If the sum of the scores is odd, it implies an impossible scenario, hence `-1` is the correct output.

3. **Calculation of Draws**:
   - The program calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This represents the total number of games played because each game contributes 2 points to the total score.
   - The program calculates `y` as `a + b`. This represents the maximum number of games that could have involved the first two players, as the third player's score `c` must be at least equal to the sum of the scores of the first two players for the scores to be valid.
   - The program then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. This is because the number of draws cannot exceed the total number of games played (`x`), and it also cannot exceed the number of games that could have involved the first two players (`y`).

4. **Correctness of Logic**: The logic used in the program is correct. It ensures that the total points are even, and it calculates the maximum possible number of draws based on the constraints provided.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or identifies invalid score combinations. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
