The code snippet assigns new values to `n` and `k` by reading an input, splitting it into two parts, converting each part to an integer, and then assigning them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state mentioned that `i` is incremented by 1 and `t` remains the same, but these variables are not affected by the given code snippet. Therefore, `i` and `t` retain their initial states. `n` and `k` are reassigned based on the input.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input.**
