The `print(1)` statement in the provided Python code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of any variables `t`, `n`, or `k`. The print statement will output the integer `1` regardless of the values of these variables.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state describes the variables `t`, `n`, and `k`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print(1)` statement directly outputs the integer `1`.

Thus, the output of the print statement is simply `1`.

Output: **1**
