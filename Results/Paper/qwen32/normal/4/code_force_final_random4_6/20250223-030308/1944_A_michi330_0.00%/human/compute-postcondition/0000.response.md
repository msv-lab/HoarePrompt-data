Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ (n * (n - 1)) / 2.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of an integer input by the user, which is within the range of 1 to 1000. The preconditions for `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are described for each test case that will follow.
