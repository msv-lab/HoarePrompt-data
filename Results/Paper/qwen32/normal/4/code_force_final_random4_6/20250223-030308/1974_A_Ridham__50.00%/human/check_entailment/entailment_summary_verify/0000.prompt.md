You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        space_x = x * 1
        space_y = y * 4
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        if y % 2 == 0:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2
        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            if space_x % 15 == 0:
                extra_screen = space_x // 15
            else:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y`. For each test case, it calculates the number of screens required to accommodate both `x` and `y` under specific conditions, and outputs the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program is designed to determine the minimum number of screens needed to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons on a 5x3 grid (15 cells per screen).

Here is the provided code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        space_x = x * 1
        space_y = y * 4
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        if y % 2 == 0:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2
        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            if space_x % 15 == 0:
                extra_screen = space_x // 15
            else:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
```

### Potential Issues

1. **Handling of 2x2 Icons**: The program calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons (`screen_require_for_y`) by dividing `y` by 2 and rounding up. This is correct.
2. **Remaining Cells Calculation**: After placing the 2x2 icons, it calculates the remaining cells on the screens already used for 2x2 icons (`remaining_cells`).
3. **Handling of 1x1 Icons**: It checks if the remaining cells are sufficient for the 1x1 icons. If not, it calculates additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons (`extra_screen`).

### Edge Cases to Consider

- **No Icons**: `x = 0`, `y = 0` → Should return `0`.
- **Only 2x2 Icons**: `x = 0`, `y = 3` → Should return `2`.
- **Only 1x1 Icons**: `x = 15`, `y = 0` → Should return `1`.
- **Mixed Icons**: `x = 7`, `y = 2` → Should return `1`.
- **Exact Fit**: `x = 11`, `y = 1` → Should return `2`.

### Testing the Program

Let's test the program with the provided examples and some additional edge cases.
