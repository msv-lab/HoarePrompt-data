The variable `space_x` is assigned the value of `x * 1`, which simplifies to `x`. The values of `t`, `n`, `result`, and `y` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `space_x` is equal to `x`.**
