The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common placeholder for a loop variable that is not used within the loop body. Since the underscore does not represent any specific state that needs to be adjusted, the state of the program at the start of the next iteration of the loop will remain the same in terms of the variables provided.

However, since the loop will execute `n` times, we need to ensure that `n` is decremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration to reflect the number of remaining iterations.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0 and will be decremented by 1; `x` and `y` are integers read from the input such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `space_x` is equal to `x`; `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`; `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`; If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`. Otherwise, `y` is not divisible by 2, and `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`; `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list containing the value of `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` is a list containing one element, which is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`, and `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15 + 1` if `space_x` is not a multiple of 15, or `space_x // 15` if `space_x` is a multiple of 15.**

Since `n` is the only variable that needs adjustment and it is decremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, we can express the state as:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is `n - 1`; `x` and `y` are integers read from the input such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `space_x` is equal to `x`; `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`; `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`; If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`. Otherwise, `y` is not divisible by 2, and `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`; `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list containing the value of `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` is a list containing one element, which is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`, and `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15 + 1` if `space_x` is not a multiple of 15, or `space_x // 15` if `space_x` is a multiple of 15.**
