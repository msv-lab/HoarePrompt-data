The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to `n`. The value of `t` and the test cases (pairs of `x` and `y`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `n` while keeping the initial conditions for `t` and the test cases intact.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers x and y such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` is an input integer.**
