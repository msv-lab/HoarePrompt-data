The code snippet assigns the value of `y * 4` to the variable `space_y`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`.**
