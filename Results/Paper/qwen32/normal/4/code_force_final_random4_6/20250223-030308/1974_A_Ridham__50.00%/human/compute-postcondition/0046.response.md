The code snippet directly modifies the value of `screen_require_for_y` to `y // 2 + 1`, overriding the previous condition-based assignment. This change impacts the calculation of `remaining_cells` and potentially the `result` list.

Given the initial state, `screen_require_for_y` was conditionally set based on whether `y` is even or odd. Now, it is unconditionally set to `y // 2 + 1`, which means `remaining_cells` will be recalculated as `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - space_y`. This change will affect the logic that determines the `result` list.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is `n + 1`; `x` and `y` are integers read from the input such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `space_x` is equal to `x * 1`; `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`; `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`; `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`; `remaining_cells` is `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - space_y`; `result` is recalculated based on the new `remaining_cells` and `space_x` values.**

In simpler terms, the value of `screen_require_for_y` is now unconditionally `y // 2 + 1`, and `remaining_cells` and `result` are recalculated based on this new value.
