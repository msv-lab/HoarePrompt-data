To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the logic of the code snippet. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State and Variables:
1. **t**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This represents the number of test cases.
2. **n**: Initialized to 0.
3. **x** and **y**: Integers read from the input such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 99\).
4. **space_x**: Calculated as `x * 1`.
5. **space_y**: Calculated as `y * 4`.
6. **total_space**: Calculated as `space_y + space_x`.
7. **screen_require_for_y**: Calculated as `y // 2` if `y` is even, otherwise `y // 2 + 1`.
8. **remaining_cells**: Calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
9. **result**: A list that contains the values determined for each iteration of the loop.
10. **extra_space**: Calculated as `space_x - remaining_cells` if `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`.
11. **extra_screen**: Calculated as `extra_space // 15 + 1` if `space_x` is not a multiple of 15, or `extra_space // 15` if `space_x` is a multiple of 15.

### Calculation Logic:
For each test case (determined by the value of `t`):
1. Read `x` and `y`.
2. Calculate `space_x` and `space_y`.
3. Calculate `total_space`.
4. Calculate `screen_require_for_y` based on whether `y` is even or odd.
5. Calculate `remaining_cells`.
6. Determine if `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`:
   - If true, add `screen_require_for_y` to the `result` list.
   - If false, calculate `extra_space` and `extra_screen`, then add `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` to the `result` list.
7. Repeat the process for all `t` test cases.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output each element of the `result` list, each on a new line.

### Explanation:
Since we don't have specific values for `x` and `y` for each test case, we can't determine the exact numerical values of `result`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the calculations performed.

For each test case:
- The number of screens required for `y` is determined by `screen_require_for_y`.
- The remaining cells are calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
- If `space_x` fits within the remaining cells, the number of screens required is `screen_require_for_y`.
- If `space_x` exceeds the remaining cells, additional screens are calculated based on the extra space required.

### Final Output Description:
The output will be a series of integers, each on a new line, representing the number of screens required for each test case based on the given conditions.

Output: **[screen_require_for_y or (extra_screen + screen_require_for_y) for each test case]**
