Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Note

The solution for the first test case can look as follows:

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers x and y such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        space_x = x * 1
        
        space_y = y * 4
        
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        
        if y % 2 == 0:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2
        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            if space_x % 15 == 0:
                extra_screen = space_x // 15
            else:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `space_x` is equal to `x * 1`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`; otherwise, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`. `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list containing the value of `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` is a list containing one element, which is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`, and `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15 + 1` if `space_x` is not a multiple of 15, or `space_x // 15` if `space_x` is a multiple of 15. The loop has finished executing all iterations, and `result` contains the values determined for each iteration.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
    #This is printed: [screen_require_for_y or (extra_screen + screen_require_for_y) for each test case]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y`. For each test case, it calculates the number of screens required to accommodate both `x` and `y` under specific conditions, and outputs the result for each test case.
