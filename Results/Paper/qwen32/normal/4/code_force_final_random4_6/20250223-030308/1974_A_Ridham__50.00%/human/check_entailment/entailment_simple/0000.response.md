### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided program to determine if it correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required based on the given problem description.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`.

2. **Calculation of Spaces:**
   - `space_x` is calculated as `x * 1`, which is just `x`, representing the total number of 1x1 icons.
   - `space_y` is calculated as `y * 4`, representing the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons.

3. **Determine Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2` because each screen can hold 2 non-overlapping 2x2 icons.
   - If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1` because an extra screen is needed for the remaining 2x2 icon.

4. **Calculate Remaining Cells:**
   - `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. This represents the remaining cells on the screens after placing all 2x2 icons.

5. **Determine Screens for 1x1 Icons:**
   - If `space_x` (total 1x1 icons) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, it means the remaining cells on the screens that already have 2x2 icons are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons, and no additional screens are needed.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates `extra_space` as `space_x - remaining_cells`, which is the number of 1x1 icons that need additional screens.
   - `extra_screen` is calculated as `extra_space // 15 + 1` if `extra_space` is not a multiple of 15, or `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space` is a multiple of 15. This represents the number of additional screens needed to place the remaining 1x1 icons.

6. **Output:**
   - The program appends the total number of screens needed (`screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`) to the result list for each test case and prints the results.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

Let's verify the logic with the first few test cases from the example:

1. **Test Case 1: x = 1, y = 1**
   - `screen_require_for_y` = 1 (since `y` is odd)
   - `remaining_cells` = 15 * 1 - 4 = 11
   - Since `space_x` (1) <= `remaining_cells` (11), no additional screens are needed.
   - **Output:** 1

2. **Test Case 2: x = 7, y = 2**
   - `screen_require_for_y` = 1 (since `y` is even)
   - `remaining_cells` = 15 * 1 - 8 = 7
   - Since `space_x` (7) > `remaining_cells` (7), additional screens are needed.
   - `extra_space` = 7 - 7 = 0
   - No additional screens are needed.
   - **Output:** 1

3. **Test Case 3: x = 12, y = 4**
   - `screen_require_for_y` = 2 (since `y` is even)
   - `remaining_cells` = 15 * 2 - 16 = 14
   - Since `space_x` (12) <= `remaining_cells` (14), no additional screens are needed.
   - **Output:** 2

4. **Test Case 4: x = 0, y = 3**
   - `screen_require_for_y` = 2 (since `y` is odd)
   - `remaining_cells` = 15 * 2 - 12 = 18
   - Since `space_x` (0) <= `remaining_cells` (18), no additional screens are needed.
   - **Output:** 2

5. **Test Case 5: x = 1, y = 0**
   - `screen_require_for_y` = 0 (since `y` is even)
   - `remaining_cells` = 15 * 0 - 0 = 0
   - Since `space_x` (1) > `remaining_cells` (0), additional screens are needed.
   - `extra_space` = 1 - 0 = 1
   - `extra_screen` = 1 // 15 + 1 = 1
   - **Output:** 1

6. **Test Case 6: x = 8, y = 1**
   - `screen_require_for_y` = 1 (since `y` is odd)
   - `remaining_cells` = 15 * 1 - 4 = 11
   - Since `space_x` (8) <= `remaining_cells` (11), no additional screens are needed.
   - **Output:** 1

All these test cases match the expected output, indicating that the logic is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for all the test cases provided.

**Correctness: True**
