The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, and for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. The variable `n` must be greater than 0, and `result` is an empty list. 

After executing the code, `x` and `y` will hold the specific integer values read from the input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `result`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.**
