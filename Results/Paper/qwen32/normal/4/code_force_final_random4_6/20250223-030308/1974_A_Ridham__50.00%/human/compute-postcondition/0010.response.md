The code snippet calculates `screen_require_for_y` as `y // 2 + 1`. Given that `y` is not divisible by 2, `y // 2` will be an integer division, effectively discarding the remainder, and then 1 is added to this result. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`, `y` is not divisible by 2, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`.**
