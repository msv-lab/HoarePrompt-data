To determine what will be printed by the `print(res)` statement, we need to understand the value of `res` based on the given initial state.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `a`**: The initial state does not specify the exact contents of the list `a`, but it does not change.
2. **Variable `res`**: `res` is defined as the count of all `0`s in the list `a`. Since the exact contents of `a` are not specified, we can only describe `res` in terms of the list `a`.
3. **Variables `i`, `t`, and `n`**: These variables are mentioned but their values or roles are not relevant to the value of `res` or the `print(res)` statement.

### Conclusion:
The value of `res` is the number of `0`s in the list `a`. Since the list `a` is not provided, we cannot compute an exact numerical value for `res`. However, we can describe it precisely in terms of the list `a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **res (where res is the count of all 0s in the list `a`)**
