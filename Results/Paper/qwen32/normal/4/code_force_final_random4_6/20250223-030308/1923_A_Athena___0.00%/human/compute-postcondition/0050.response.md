Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement:

- `a` is a list with all trailing zeros removed. This means that if the original list had trailing zeros, they have been removed. The exact contents of `a` are not specified, except that it does not end with any zeros.
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`, which is the index of the last element in the list `a`.
- `res` is 0, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `t` and `n` remain unchanged, but they are also not used in the print statement.

The print statement is:
```
print(a)
```

This statement will print the list `a` as it is, without any modifications. Since the exact contents of `a` are not provided, we can only describe it as a list with all trailing zeros removed.

Output: **a (where a is a list with all trailing zeros removed)**
