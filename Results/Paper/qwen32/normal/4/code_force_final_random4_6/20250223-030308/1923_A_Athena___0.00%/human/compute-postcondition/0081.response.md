Given the initial state, let's break down the variables and their values:

- `a` is a list with all trailing zeros removed. This means that if the original list had trailing zeros, they have been removed from `a`.
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`, which is the index of the last element in the list `a`. However, this variable is not used in the print statement.
- `res` is `0`, but this variable is also not used in the print statement.
- `t` remains unchanged, but since it's not used in the print statement, its value is irrelevant here.
- `n` is an input integer, but its value is not used in the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(a)
```

Since `a` is the only variable used in the print statement, and it is described as a list with all trailing zeros removed, the output will be the contents of this list.

Output: **a (where a is a list with all trailing zeros removed from the original list)**

If we had the original list, we could provide the exact contents of `a`. However, based on the given information, we can only describe `a` in terms of its definition.

Output: **a (where a is a list with all trailing zeros removed from the original list)**
