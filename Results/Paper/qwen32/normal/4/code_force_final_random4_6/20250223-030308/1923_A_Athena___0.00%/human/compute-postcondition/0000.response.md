The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases, and it is within the range 1 to 1000. The other variables (`n` and the list of integers `a_i`) are not affected by this line of code and retain their initial conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, and the second line contains a list of `n` integers `a_i` where each `a_i` is either 0 or 1. There is at least one `a_i` equal to 1 in each test case.**
