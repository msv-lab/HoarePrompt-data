The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given that the last element was `0` (which was appended after removing the original last element), this operation will undo the append operation, effectively restoring `a` to its state before the `0` was appended.

The value of `i` is `len(a) - 2`, so after `a.pop()`, the length of `a` decreases by 1, making `i` equal to `len(a) - 1 - 1` or simply `len(a) - 2` again, which is unchanged in terms of its calculation but now refers to a different element in the list.

The value of `res` remains `0`, and `t` remains unchanged as per the problem statement. `n` is an input integer and also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list that is not empty (with the last element `0` removed), `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `res` is `0`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer.**
