The `pop()` function removes the last element from the list `a`. Given that the initial state specifies that the last element added to `a` is `0`, executing `a.pop()` will remove this `0` from the list. Therefore, the last element `0` is removed, and the list `a` will be in the state it was before the `0` was added.

Output State: **`a` is a list with the last element `0` removed**.
