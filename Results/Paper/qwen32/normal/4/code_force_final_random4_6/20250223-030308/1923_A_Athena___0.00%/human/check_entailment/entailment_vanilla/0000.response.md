Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single contiguous block, without any free cells between them. The operations allowed are moving a chip to the closest free cell to the left.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of cells) and the list `a` representing the cells (0 for free, 1 for chip).

2. **Trimming Leading and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The program removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a` using `pop(0)` and `pop()`. This step is correct because these free cells at the ends do not affect the minimum number of operations needed to group the chips together.

3. **Counting Operations:**
   - The program then counts the number of zeros in the trimmed list `a`. Each zero represents a free cell that needs to be filled by a chip from the right, which means an operation is needed for each zero.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the count of zeros as the result for each test case.

### Correctness Check:
- **Trimming the List:** The removal of leading and trailing zeros is correct because these free cells do not need to be considered in the process of forming a contiguous block of chips.
- **Counting Operations:** The number of operations needed is indeed the number of zeros in the trimmed list. Each zero represents a free cell that needs to be filled by a chip from the right, which requires an operation.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's verify the program with the first example from the problem statement:
- Input: `8`, `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
- After trimming, the list becomes `1 1 1 0 1 1`.
- The number of zeros in the trimmed list is `1`, which matches the expected output.

The program seems to correctly compute the minimum number of operations for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
