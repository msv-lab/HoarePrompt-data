Output State: **`a` is a list with all trailing zeros removed, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `res` is `0`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer.**

In simple terms, after the loop has finished executing, the list `a` will have no zeros at the end. The variable `i` will be set to the index of the last element in the modified list `a`. The variable `res` remains `0`, and the variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
