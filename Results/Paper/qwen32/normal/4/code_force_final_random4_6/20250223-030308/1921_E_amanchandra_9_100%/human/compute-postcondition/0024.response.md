The value of `l` is assigned the result of `max(1, b - x)`. Given that `x` is `abs(a - c) // 2`, the value of `l` will be the maximum of 1 and the result of `b - abs(a - c) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `_` is incremented by 1; `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers read from the input; `x` is `abs(a - c) // 2`; `l` is `max(1, b - abs(a - c) // 2)`**.
