The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of a rectangle defined by dimensions `h` and `w`, and two points within the rectangle defined by coordinates `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)`. For each test case, it determines and prints the result ('Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw') based on the relative positions of the points within the rectangle.
