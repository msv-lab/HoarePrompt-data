The value of `l` is determined by the expression `max(1, d - x)`. Given that `x` is `abs(a - c) // 2` and the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd, `x` will be an integer that is half of an odd number, thus making `x` an integer with a fractional part discarded (since it's integer division). Therefore, `d - x` will be computed, and `l` will be the maximum of `1` and this computed value.

The other variables (`t`, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are six integers read from the input; `a` is less than or equal to `c`; `x` is `abs(a - c) // 2`; the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd; `l` is `max(1, d - x)`**.
