Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. Each of the `t` test cases is described by six integers `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` where 1 ≤ `x_a`, `x_b` ≤ `h` ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ `y_a`, `y_b` ≤ `w` ≤ 10^9, and either `x_a` ≠ `x_b` or `y_a` ≠ `y_b`. The sum of `h` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the input integer, which represents the number of test cases. The preconditions for the test cases remain unchanged.
