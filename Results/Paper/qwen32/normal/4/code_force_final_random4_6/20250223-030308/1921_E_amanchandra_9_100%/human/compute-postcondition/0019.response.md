The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Draw'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `_`, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step explanation:

1. The variable `t` is an integer input where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable is not used in the `print` statement.
2. The variable `_` is incremented by 1. This variable is also not used in the `print` statement.
3. The variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers read from the input. These variables are not used in the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'Draw'`, the output will be:

Output: **Draw**
