Let's break down the problem step by step based on the initial state provided.

1. **Inputs and Initial Assignments:**
   - `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `_` is incremented by 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement, it's mentioned for completeness).
   - `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers read from the input.
   - `x` is calculated as `abs(a - c) // 2`.
   - `r` is calculated as `min(w, d + abs(a - c) // 2)`.
   - `l` is calculated as `max(1, d - abs(a - c) // 2)`.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement uses a conditional expression to choose between two lists: `['Draw']` and `['Alice']`.
   - The condition for choosing `['Alice']` is `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1`.

3. **Variable Values:**
   - `x` is half the absolute difference between `a` and `c`, rounded down (`abs(a - c) // 2`).
   - `r` is the minimum of `w` and `d + x`.
   - `l` is the maximum of `1` and `d - x`.

4. **Condition Explanation:**
   - `abs(l - b) <= x + 1`: This checks if the absolute difference between `l` and `b` is less than or equal to `x + 1`.
   - `abs(r - b) <= x + 1`: This checks if the absolute difference between `r` and `b` is less than or equal to `x + 1`.
   - If both conditions are true, the print statement will output `['Alice']`. Otherwise, it will output `['Draw']`.

5. **Output Determination:**
   - The exact output depends on the values of `l`, `r`, `b`, and `x`.
   - Since we do not have specific values for `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, we cannot determine the exact numerical output. However, we can describe the output based on the conditions.

Given the conditions and the structure of the problem, the output will be either `['Draw']` or `['Alice']` depending on whether the conditions `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1` are satisfied.

Output: **['Draw'] or ['Alice'] (depending on whether abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1)**
