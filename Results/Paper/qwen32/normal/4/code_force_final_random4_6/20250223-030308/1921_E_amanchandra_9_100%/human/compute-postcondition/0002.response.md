The code snippet assigns values to the variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by reading an input line, splitting it into six integers, and mapping them to these variables. The initial state only mentions `t` as an input integer, and no other variables are specified, so we assume `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not defined before this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are six integers read from the input.**
