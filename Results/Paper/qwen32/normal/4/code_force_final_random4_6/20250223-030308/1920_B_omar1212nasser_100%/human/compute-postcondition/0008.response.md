The code snippet `s2 += elements[-(negatives + i)]` updates the value of `s2` by adding the element at the index `-(negatives + i)` from the `elements` list to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

The initial state specifies that `removals` is greater than 0, `s` is updated to `s - elements[-i]`, `s2` is updated to `s2 - elements[-i]`, `elements` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged, and `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`.

After the execution of the code snippet, the value of `s2` will be `s2 - elements[-i] + elements[-(negatives + i)]`.

Output State: **`removals` is greater than 0; `s` is updated to `s - elements[-i]`; `s2` is updated to `s2 - elements[-i] + elements[-(negatives + i)]`; `elements` is unchanged; `i` is unchanged; `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`.**
