Let's go through the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations to evaluate the correctness of the program.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Alice's Move (Removal):**
   - Alice can remove up to `k` elements from the array.
   - To maximize the sum, Alice should remove the smallest `k` elements from the array.

2. **Bob's Move (Negation):**
   - Bob can negate up to `x` elements from the array.
   - To minimize the sum, Bob should negate the smallest `x` elements from the remaining array.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution takes the following steps:

1. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in ascending order. This allows us to easily identify the smallest and largest elements.

2. **Initial Sum Calculation:**
   - The initial sum `s` of the entire array is calculated.
   - The sum of the `x` largest elements (`s2`) is calculated. This represents the sum of elements Bob might negate.

3. **Calculating Possible Sums:**
   - The first possible sum is calculated as `s - 2 * s2`, which represents the sum after Bob negates the `x` largest elements.
   - For each removal from 1 to `k`, the sum `s` is updated by subtracting the removed element.
   - The sum `s2` is also updated to account for the new largest elements that Bob might negate.
   - Each possible sum is stored in the list `pos`.

4. **Maximizing the Sum:**
   - The maximum value in the list `pos` is returned, which represents the optimal sum after both players play optimally.

### Correctness Verification

Let's break down the logic in `func_2` and verify the annotations and the original assessment.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis

```python
def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    pos = []
    s = sum(elements)
    pos.append(s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:]))
    s2 = sum(elements[-negatives:])
    for i in range(1, removals + 1):
        s -= elements[-i]
        s2 -= elements[-i]
        if negatives + i <= len(elements):
            s2 += elements[-(negatives + i)]
        pos.append(s - 2 * s2)
    return max(pos)
```

- **Initial Sum Calculation:**
  - `s` is the sum of all elements.
  - `s2` is the sum of the `x` largest elements.
  - The first possible sum is `s - 2 * s2`, which accounts for Bob negating the `x` largest elements.

- **Loop Through Removals:**
  - For each removal from 1 to `k`:
    - Subtract the `i`-th smallest element from `s`.
    - Subtract the `i`-th smallest element from `s2`.
    - If `negatives + i` is within bounds, add the new `negatives + i`-th largest element to `s2`.
    - Append the new possible sum `s - 2 * s2` to `pos`.

- **Return the Maximum Sum:**
  - The maximum value in `pos` is returned, which represents the optimal sum after both players play optimally.

### Annotations Validation

The annotations describe the state of the program at key points, which align with the logic explained above. Here are the key points:

- **Before Function Call:**
  - `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers.
  - `elements` is a list of integers such that 0 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`) and 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`).

- **After Function Call:**
  - `removals` and `negatives` remain unchanged.
  - `elements` remains unchanged.
  - `pos` contains `removals + 1` elements, starting with the initial value and followed by `removals` additional values calculated as `s - 2 * s2` after each iteration.
  - `s` is decremented by the sum of the last `removals` elements of `elements`.
  - `s2` is adjusted based on the elements added and removed during the loop.

### Conclusion

The provided solution correctly implements the optimal strategies for both players and efficiently calculates the maximum possible sum after considering all combinations of removals and negations. The annotations accurately describe the program's state at key points, and the logic aligns with the problem description.

**Final:** **True**
