The code calculates the sum of the `elements` list and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of `removals`, `negatives`, and `pos` remain unchanged. The `elements` list is also not altered.

Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers, `elements` is a list of integers such that 0 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`) and 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`); `pos` is an empty list; `s` is the sum of `elements`.**
