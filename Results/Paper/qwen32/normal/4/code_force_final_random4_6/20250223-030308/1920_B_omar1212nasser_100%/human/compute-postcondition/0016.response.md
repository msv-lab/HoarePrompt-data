The code snippet appends a new value to the list `pos`. The value appended is calculated as `s - 2 * s2`. This calculation is based on the current values of `s` and `s2`, which have been previously modified in the initial state description.

The initial state describes that `removals` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is decreased by `elements[-i]`, and `s2` is also decreased by `elements[-i]`. Additionally, if `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, then `s2` is further increased by `elements[-(negatives + i)]`.

Given these modifications, the new value of `s` and `s2` are used to compute `s - 2 * s2` and append the result to `pos`. The other variables (`removals`, `i`, `elements`, `negatives`) remain unchanged by this specific line of code.

Output State: **`removals` is greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1; `s` is decreased by `elements[-i]`; `s2` is decreased by `elements[-i]` and further increased by `elements[-(negatives + i)]` if `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`; `pos` now includes the new value `s - 2 * s2`.**
