### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given functions and their behavior to determine if they correctly solve the problem.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function reads the input, which includes the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `x`, and the list `a` of `n` integers.
- It sorts the list `a` and then calls `func_2` with the parameters `k`, `x`, and the sorted list `a`.
- It prints the result returned by `func_2` for each test case.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after Alice and Bob have made their moves.
- It initializes `pos` as an empty list and calculates the initial sum `s` of the array `elements`.
- The first element of `pos` is calculated as `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`, which represents the sum after Bob flips the `negatives` largest elements.
- Then, it iteratively adjusts the sum by removing elements from the end of the array (which are the smallest elements after sorting) and adjusts the sum of the flipped elements accordingly.
- It appends each new calculated sum to `pos`.
- Finally, it returns the maximum value from the list `pos`.

### Analysis:
- **Sorting**: Sorting the array `a` ensures that the smallest elements are considered for removal first by Alice and the largest elements are considered for flipping by Bob.
- **Initial Calculation**: The initial sum `s` is adjusted by subtracting twice the sum of the `negatives` largest elements because flipping the largest elements will reduce the sum the most.
- **Iterative Adjustment**: By iterating through the array and removing elements from the end (smallest elements), the function recalculates the sum after each removal and adjusts the sum of the flipped elements accordingly.
- **Maximization**: The function keeps track of all possible sums and returns the maximum one, ensuring that both players play optimally.

### Conclusion:
The functions together correctly implement the logic to find the maximum possible sum after Alice and Bob make their moves optimally. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
