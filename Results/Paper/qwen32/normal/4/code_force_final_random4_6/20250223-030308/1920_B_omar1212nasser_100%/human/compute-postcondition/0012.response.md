The value of `s` is decreased by the value of the element at the `-i` index in the `elements` list. The values of `removals` and the increment operation on `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `removals` is greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1; `s` is decreased by `elements[-i]`.

Output State: **`removals` is greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1; `s` is decreased by `elements[-i]`.**
