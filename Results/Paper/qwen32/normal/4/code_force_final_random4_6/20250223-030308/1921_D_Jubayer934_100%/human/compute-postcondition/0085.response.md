Output State: **`temp` is `i`; `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all previous `i` values and the newly appended value `abs(a[i] - b[i])`; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is assigned the value read from the input; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input list; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input list in descending order; `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `temp`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain as they were before the `break` statement, with the only change being that we exit from the most internal loop or if statement.
