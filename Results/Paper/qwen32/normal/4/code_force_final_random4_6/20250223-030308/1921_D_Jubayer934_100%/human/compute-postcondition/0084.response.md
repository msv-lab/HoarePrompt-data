The code snippet `temp = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `temp`. The other variables (`ans`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged. The specific value of `i` is not provided, so we will denote the new value of `temp` as `i`.

Output State: **`temp` is `i`; `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all previous `i` values and the newly appended value `abs(a[i] - b[i])`; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is assigned the value read from the input; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input list; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input list in descending order; `i` is `i + 1`.**
