The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, `ans` now includes the value `abs(a[0] - b[0])`**.
