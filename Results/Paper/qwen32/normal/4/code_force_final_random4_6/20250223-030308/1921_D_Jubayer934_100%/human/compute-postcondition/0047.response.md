The values of the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, and `temp` do not change due to the `break` statement. The `break` statement only affects the control flow by exiting the nearest enclosing loop, but it does not alter the values of any variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, `ans` includes `abs(a[i] - b[i])`, `temp` is `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
