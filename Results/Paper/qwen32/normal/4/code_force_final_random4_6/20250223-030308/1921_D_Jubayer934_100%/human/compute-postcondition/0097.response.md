Postcondition: **`temp` is the index `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` first becomes true, or `-1` if it never becomes true. If `temp` is not `-1`, `n` must be greater than `temp` and `ans` includes the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` from `0` to `temp`, and the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for all `i` from `temp` to `n-1`. If `temp` is `-1`, `ans` includes the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.**
