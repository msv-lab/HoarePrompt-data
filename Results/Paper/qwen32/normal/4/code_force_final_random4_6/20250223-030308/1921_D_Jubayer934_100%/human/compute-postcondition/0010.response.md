Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are lists of integers. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `temp` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `temp` and the loop or if statement continues.**
