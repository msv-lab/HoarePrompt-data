The code snippet `ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))` appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. The values of `temp`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The only change is that `ans` now contains one additional element, which is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

Output State: **`temp` is `i` if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. Otherwise, `temp` remains -1; `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is assigned the value read from the input; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input list; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input list in descending order.**
