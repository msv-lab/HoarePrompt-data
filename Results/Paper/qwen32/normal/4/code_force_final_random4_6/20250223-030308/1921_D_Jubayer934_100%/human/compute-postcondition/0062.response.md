Output State: **`temp` is an index where `abs(a[temp] - b[-(n - temp)]) > abs(a[temp] - b[temp])` is met, and `temp` is not equal to -1, `n` must be greater than `temp + 2`, `i` is `temp + 2`, and `ans` includes `abs(a[temp + 1] - b[-(n - (temp + 1))])` and `abs(a[temp + 2] - b[-(n - (temp + 2))])`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is `temp + 2`, and the code appends `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` to `ans`. Since `i` is `temp + 2`, the new element added to `ans` is `abs(a[temp + 2] - b[-(n - (temp + 2))])`. All other conditions and values remain the same.
