Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, and the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `temp` is `i`.**

The variable `temp` is assigned the value of `i`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
