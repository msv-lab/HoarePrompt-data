To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust only the variables present in the loop head, which are `i`, `temp`, `n`, and `m`. However, `temp`, `n`, and `m` are not modified within the loop, so they will remain the same. The variable `i` is the only one that changes with each iteration.

Given:
- `i` is `temp + 1` at the end of the previous iteration.
- The loop is defined as `for i in range(temp, n):`, meaning `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `temp + 2`.

State: **`n` remains the first integer from the input, `m` remains the second integer from the input, `temp` is an integer such that `0 <= temp < n`, `ans` contains the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks at the index `temp` and also includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` and `abs(a[temp + 1] - b[-(n - (temp + 1))])`, `a` remains the sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input, `b` remains the first `m` elements of the sorted list of the next `m` integers from the input in reverse order, `i` is `temp + 2`**
