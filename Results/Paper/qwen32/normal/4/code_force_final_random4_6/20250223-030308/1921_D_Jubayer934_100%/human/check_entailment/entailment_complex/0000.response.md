### Reasoning:

The program aims to find the maximum total difference \( D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| \) by selecting \( n \) integers from Vasya's array \( b_i \) and arranging them to maximize the difference with Petya's array \( a_i \).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) (length of Petya's array) and \( m \) (length of Vasya's array).
   - It then reads Petya's array \( a_i \) and Vasya's array \( b_i \).

2. **Sorting:**
   - Petya's array \( a \) is sorted in ascending order.
   - Vasya's array \( b \) is sorted in descending order.

3. **Selection and Calculation:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the absolute differences.
   - It iterates through the first \( n \) elements of the sorted arrays \( a \) and \( b \).
   - For each element in \( a \), it compares the absolute difference between the current element in \( a \) and the corresponding element in \( b \) (in descending order) with the absolute difference between the current element in \( a \) and the corresponding element in \( b \) (in ascending order).
   - If the difference with the descending order element is larger, it switches to using the descending order elements from that point onwards.
   - It appends the calculated absolute differences to the list `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the sum of the absolute differences stored in `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis:

The logic of the program is sound. By sorting Petya's array in ascending order and Vasya's array in descending order, the program ensures that the largest possible differences are considered first. The switch to using the descending order elements when a larger difference is found ensures that the total difference is maximized.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem and produces the expected output for the given examples.

**Correctness:** **True**
