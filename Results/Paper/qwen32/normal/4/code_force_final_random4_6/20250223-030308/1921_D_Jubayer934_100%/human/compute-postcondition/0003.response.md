The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `ans`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `temp` are not altered by this code. Therefore, the output state retains the values of `n` and `m` as the first and second integers from the input, respectively, and `temp` remains -1. The new variable `ans` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is -1, `ans` is an empty list.**
