The code snippet provided resets the `ans` list to an empty list, which means it discards any previous values that `ans` might have contained. The values of `temp`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. The description of the initial state of `ans` is no longer relevant since `ans` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`temp` is -1; `ans` is an empty list; `n` and `m` are assigned the values read from the input.**
