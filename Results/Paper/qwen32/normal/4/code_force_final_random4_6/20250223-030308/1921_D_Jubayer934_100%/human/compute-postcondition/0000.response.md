The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not plan to use. The loop will execute based on the number of iterations specified by the expression `int(input())`. Therefore, the state we need to adjust is the input that will be provided to the `input()` function.

To ensure that the loop executes, the input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer. Given the problem description, the input consists of multiple test cases, each starting with two integers `n` and `m`. The first input to `int(input())` should be the number of test cases, which must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **The first input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer (number of test cases, at least 1).**

Since the loop variable `_` is not used in the loop body, there are no other states related to the loop variable that need to be adjusted. The subsequent inputs (the values of `n`, `m`, and the arrays `a_i` and `b_i`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.
