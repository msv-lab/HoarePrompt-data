The code snippet calculates the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` and adds it to `sum`. Given that `i` is 3, we can compute the value of the expression as follows:

1. Calculate `i * i`: \(3 * 3 = 9\)
2. Calculate `(i - 1) * (i - 1)`: \(2 * 2 = 4\)
3. Subtract the second result from the first: \(9 - 4 = 5\)
4. Multiply the result by `i`: \(5 * 3 = 15\)

This value, 15, is then added to `sum`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not referenced or modified in the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 3, `sum` is increased by 15**.
