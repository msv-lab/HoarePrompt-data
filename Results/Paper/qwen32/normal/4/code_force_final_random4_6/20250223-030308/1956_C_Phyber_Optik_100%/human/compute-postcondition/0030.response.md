Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i`, `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `sum` is increased by `3*i*i - 3*i + 1`**

Explanation: The value of `sum` is updated by adding the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to it. Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses, we get `i * i - (i^2 - 2*i + 1) = 2*i - 1`. Multiplying this by `i` results in `2*i*i - i`, which simplifies to `3*i*i - 3*i + 1` when considering the full expression. The value of `i` and the condition that `n` must be greater than `i` remain unchanged.
