Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of an `n × n` matrix. For each test case, the function processes the matrix and returns a result (the specific result is not detailed here but is implied by the context of the problem). The total number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) is provided first, and the sum of `n^2` for all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.**
