Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

We have an `n x n` matrix filled with zeroes. The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix using no more than `2n` operations. The operations are:
1. Type 1: Choose a row `i` and fill it with a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`.
2. Type 2: Choose a column `i` and fill it with a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution works as follows:
1. For each test case, it calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix.
2. It then prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, which is `2n`.
3. For each row `j` from `1` to `n`, it performs two operations:
   - Type 1 operation on row `n - j + 1` with permutation `1, 2, ..., n`.
   - Type 2 operation on column `n - j + 1` with permutation `1, 2, ..., n`.

### Verification

Let's verify if the solution is correct:

1. **Maximum Sum Calculation**:
   - The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling the matrix with the largest possible numbers in each row and column.
   - The sum of the first `n` natural numbers is `n * (n + 1) / 2`.
   - The sum of the first `n` squares is `n * (n + 1) * (2n + 1) / 6`.
   - The maximum sum for an `n x n` matrix, where each row and column is filled with a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`, is the sum of the first `n` squares, which is `n * (n + 1) * (2n + 1) / 6`.

2. **Operations**:
   - The solution performs `2n` operations, which is within the allowed limit.
   - By performing Type 1 and Type 2 operations on each row and column, the matrix is filled with the largest possible numbers.

### Conclusion

The solution correctly calculates the maximum sum of the matrix and performs the required operations within the allowed limit. Therefore, the solution is correct.

### Final Answer

Reasoning: The solution correctly calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix and performs the required operations within the allowed limit of `2n` operations.
Correctness: **True**
