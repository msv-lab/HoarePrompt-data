You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

We have an `n x n` matrix filled with zeroes. The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix using no more than `2n` operations. The operations are:
1. Type 1: Choose a row `i` and fill it with a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`.
2. Type 2: Choose a column `i` and fill it with a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution works as follows:
1. For each test case, it calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix.
2. It then prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, which is `2n`.
3. For each row `j` from `1` to `n`, it performs two operations:
   - Type 1 operation on row `n - j + 1` with permutation `1, 2, ..., n`.
   - Type 2 operation on column `n - j + 1` with permutation `1, 2, ..., n`.

### Verification

Let's verify if the solution is correct:

1. **Maximum Sum Calculation**:
   - The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling the matrix with the largest possible numbers in each row and column.
   - The sum of the first `n` natural numbers is `n * (n + 1) / 2`.
   - The sum of the first `n` squares is `n * (n + 1) * (2n + 1) / 6`.
   - The maximum sum for an `n x n` matrix, where each row and column is filled with a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`, is the sum of the first `n` squares, which is `n * (n + 1) * (2n + 1) / 6`.

2. **Operations**:
   - The solution performs `2n` operations, which is within the allowed limit.
   - By performing Type 1 and Type 2 operations on each row and column, the matrix is filled with the largest possible numbers.

### Conclusion

The solution correctly calculates the maximum sum of the matrix and performs the required operations within the allowed limit. Therefore, the solution is correct.

### Final Answer

Reasoning: The solution correctly calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix and performs the required operations within the allowed limit of `2n` operations.
