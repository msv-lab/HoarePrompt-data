To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for j in range(1, n + 1):`, which involves the variables `j` and `n`.

### Analysis:

1. **Variable `j`:**
   - `j` is the loop variable that will take on values from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
   - Before the loop starts, `j` is not defined in the provided state. However, the loop will initialize `j` to 1 during its first iteration.
   - Therefore, there is no need to adjust `j` before the loop starts.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - `n` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.
   - If `n` is less than 1, the loop will not execute because `range(1, n + 1)` will be an empty range.
   - To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be at least 1.

### Conclusion:

The only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment is `n`. The value of `sum` does not affect the execution of the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted.

### Final State:

State: **`sum` is calculated as 1 plus the sum of (2i^2 - i) for i from 2 to n, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
