The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's state directly. The loop's execution depends on the variable `t`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted:
- `n` remains the same.
- `j` remains `n + 1`.
- `t` is decremented by 1.
- `sum` remains unchanged.

State: **`n` remains the same, `j` is `n + 1`, `t` is `t - 1`, `sum` is \(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\)**.
