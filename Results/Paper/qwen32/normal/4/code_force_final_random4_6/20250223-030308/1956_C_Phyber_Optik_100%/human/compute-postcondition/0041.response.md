Let's break down the given print statement and the variables involved:

1. **Variable `n`**: It is given that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
2. **Variable `j`**: It is explicitly stated that `j` is 2.
3. **Variable `t`**: It is mentioned that `t` remains unchanged, but it is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
4. **Variable `sum`**: It is defined as \(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\), but this variable is not used in the print statement either, so we can ignore it for this task.

The print statement is:
```python
print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's evaluate each part of the print statement:

- **Constant `2`**: This will simply print the number 2.
- **Expression `n - j + 1`**: Since `j` is 2, this simplifies to `n - 2 + 1` which is `n - 1`.
- **`*range(1, n + 1)`**: This will unpack the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and print each number in the range separated by spaces.

Putting it all together, the output of the print statement will be:
- The number 2.
- The value of `n - 1`.
- The numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

Given that `n` is at least 1, the output will always start with 2, followed by `n - 1`, and then the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **2, [n - 1], 1, 2, ..., [n] (where [n] is the value of n and [n - 1] is n minus 1)**
