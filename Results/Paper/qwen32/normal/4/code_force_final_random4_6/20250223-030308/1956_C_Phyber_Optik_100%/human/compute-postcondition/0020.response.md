Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `sum` is calculated as `1 + sum(2i^2 - i) for i from 2 to n`, where `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
2. `j` is defined as `n + 1`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
```python
print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **First Argument: `2`**
   - This is a constant value `2`.

2. **Second Argument: `n - j + 1`**
   - Given `j = n + 1`, we can substitute `j` in the expression:
     \[
     n - j + 1 = n - (n + 1) + 1 = n - n - 1 + 1 = 0
     \]
   - Therefore, `n - j + 1` evaluates to `0`.

3. **Third Argument: `*range(1, n + 1)`**
   - The `*` operator unpacks the range object into individual elements.
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates numbers from `1` to `n` inclusive.
   - For example, if `n = 4`, the range will be `1, 2, 3, 4`.

### Final Output:
Combining all the parts, the output of the print statement will be:
- The first element is `2`.
- The second element is `0` (as derived from `n - j + 1`).
- The third part is the unpacked range from `1` to `n`.

Therefore, the final output format is:
Output: **2, 0, 1, 2, ..., n (where n is the given integer greater than or equal to 1)**

To provide a more precise example, if `n = 4`:
Output: **2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4**

However, since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we describe it in terms of `n`:
Output: **2, 0, 1, 2, ..., n (where n is the given integer greater than or equal to 1)**

Thus, the final answer in the required format is:
Output: **2, 0, 1, 2, ..., n (where n is the given integer greater than or equal to 1)**
