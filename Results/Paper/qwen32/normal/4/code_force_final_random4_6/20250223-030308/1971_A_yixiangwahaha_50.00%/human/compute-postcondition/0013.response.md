The code appends an integer value from `xylist[0]` to the list `x`. Given that `x` initially contains two identical integer values of `xylist[0]`, after the append operation, `x` will contain three identical integer values of `xylist[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input string representing the number of test cases, `x` is a list containing three identical integer values of `xylist[0]`, `y` is a list containing two identical integer values of `xylist[1]`, `xylist` is a new list of substrings from the new input split by spaces, `i` is 5.**
