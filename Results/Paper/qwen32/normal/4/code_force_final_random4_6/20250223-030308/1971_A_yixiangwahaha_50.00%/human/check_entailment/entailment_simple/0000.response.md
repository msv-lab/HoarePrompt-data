Reasoning:  
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect based on the problem description.

1. **Fixed Iteration Count**: The program uses a fixed iteration count of 10 (`for i in range(10):`) for both reading inputs and processing them. This is incorrect because the number of test cases, `t`, can vary from 1 to 100. The program should iterate `t` times instead of a fixed 10 times.

2. **Output Formatting**: The program correctly prints the minimum and maximum values for each test case, but there is an unnecessary space after the minimum value in the print statement (`print(x[i], ' ', y[i])`). According to the problem description, the output should have exactly two integers separated by a single space without any additional spaces.

3. **Unused Variable `t`**: The variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases, is read but not used. The program should use `t` to determine the number of iterations for both reading inputs and processing them.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly handle all possible inputs as per the problem description, particularly the varying number of test cases.

Correctness: **False**
