The code snippet provided initializes a new empty list `y`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an input string representing the number of test cases and `x` is an empty list. The code does not affect `t` or `x`, so these variables remain unchanged. The new list `y` is introduced and is also an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an input string representing the number of test cases; `x` is an empty list; `y` is an empty list.**
