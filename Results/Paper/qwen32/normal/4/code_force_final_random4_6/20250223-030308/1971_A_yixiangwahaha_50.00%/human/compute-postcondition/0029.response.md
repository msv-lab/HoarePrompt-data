Postcondition: **`t` is an input string representing the number of test cases, `x` is a list containing ten integer values of `xylist[0]` from ten different inputs, `y` is a list containing ten integer values of `xylist[1]` from ten different inputs, and `i` is 2. If `x[i] < y[i]`, then no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
