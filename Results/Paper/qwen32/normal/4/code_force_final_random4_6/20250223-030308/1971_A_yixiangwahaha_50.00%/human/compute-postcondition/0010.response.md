The code appends the integer value of `xylist[1]` to the list `y`. Since `y` initially contains one integer value from `xylist[1]`, after the execution, `y` will contain two identical integer values of `xylist[1]`. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `xylist`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input string representing the number of test cases, `x` is a list containing two identical integer values of `xylist[0]`, `y` is a list containing two identical integer values of `xylist[1]`, `xylist` is a new list of substrings from the input split by spaces, `i` is 4.**
