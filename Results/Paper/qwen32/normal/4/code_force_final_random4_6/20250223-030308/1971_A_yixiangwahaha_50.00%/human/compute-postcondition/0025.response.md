Postcondition: **`t` is an input string representing the number of test cases, `x` is a list containing ten integer values of `xylist[0]` from ten different inputs, `y` is a list containing ten integer values of `xylist[1]` from ten different inputs, and `i` is 1. After the if-else block, if `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`, then `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`. Otherwise, `x[i]` is greater than or equal to `y[i]`.**

This postcondition summarizes that the state of the variables `t`, `x`, `y`, and `i` remains unchanged after the if-else block, and the relationship between `x[i]` and `y[i]` is clearly defined based on the condition.
