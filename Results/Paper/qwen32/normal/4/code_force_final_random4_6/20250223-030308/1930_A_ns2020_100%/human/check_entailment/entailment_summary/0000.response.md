### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum possible score by repeatedly selecting pairs of integers from the list and adding the smaller of the two to the score. To achieve the maximum score, the optimal strategy is to pair the smallest possible integers together. This way, the score is maximized because the sum of the smaller numbers in each pair is added to the score.

The given program correctly implements this strategy:
1. It sorts the list of integers in ascending order.
2. By summing the integers at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...), it effectively sums up the smaller numbers in each pair (since the list is sorted, the smaller number in each pair will be at the even index).

For example, in the sorted list `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, the pairs would be `(1, 2)` and `(1, 2)`, and the score would be `1 + 1 = 2`.

The execution summary confirms that the program performs these steps correctly for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
