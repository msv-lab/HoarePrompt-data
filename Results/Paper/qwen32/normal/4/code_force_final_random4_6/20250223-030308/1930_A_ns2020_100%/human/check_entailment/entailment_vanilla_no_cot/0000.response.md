Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the strategy to achieve the maximum final score. By sorting the list of integers and then summing every second element starting from the first (i.e., the smallest elements), it ensures that the sum of the minimums of each pair is maximized. This is because, in a sorted list, pairing the smallest available numbers will always yield the highest possible sum of minimums.
