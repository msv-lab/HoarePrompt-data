The code snippet provided sorts the list `A`. Therefore, the list `A` will now be in ascending order. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the sorting operation on `A`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 4999, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7, `A` is a sorted list of integers provided by the new input.**
