The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and then assigns this list of integers to the variable `A`. This means that `A` will now hold the new list of integers provided by the input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 4999, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7, `A` is a list of integers provided by the new input.**
