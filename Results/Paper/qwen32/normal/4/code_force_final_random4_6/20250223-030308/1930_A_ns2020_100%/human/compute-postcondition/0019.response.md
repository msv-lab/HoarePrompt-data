Output State: **`t` is 0, no further input is processed, and the loop terminates.**

In natural language, after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be 0, indicating that there are no more test cases to process. The loop will terminate, and no further input will be read or processed. The state of any other variables that were not affected by the loop (such as the initial value of `t` before the loop started) will remain unchanged, but they are not relevant to the final state of the loop.
