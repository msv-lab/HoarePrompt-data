The value of `t` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `A`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 4999, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7, `A` is a sorted list of integers.**
