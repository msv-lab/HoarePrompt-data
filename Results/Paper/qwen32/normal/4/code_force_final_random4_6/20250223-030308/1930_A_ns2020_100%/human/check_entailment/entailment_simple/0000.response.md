### Reasoning:
The problem requires us to maximize the score by always choosing the smallest possible number in each pair we remove from the list. The strategy to achieve this is to sort the list of numbers and then sum every second number starting from the first one. This ensures that we are always picking the smaller number in each pair (since the list is sorted).

Let's break down the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers `A`.

2. **Sorting the List:**
   - The list `A` is sorted in ascending order. This ensures that the smallest numbers are at the beginning of the list.

3. **Calculating the Score:**
   - The program calculates the score by summing every second element in the sorted list starting from the first element (`A[::2]`). This effectively picks the smaller number in each pair because the list is sorted.

4. **Output:**
   - The score for each test case is printed.

### Example Walkthrough:
- For the input `1 1 2 3`, the sorted list is `[1, 2, 3]`. The program picks `1` (the first element) and adds it to the score.
- For the input `2 1 1 2 1`, the sorted list is `[1, 1, 1, 2]`. The program picks `1` and `1` (the first and third elements) and adds them to the score, resulting in `2`.
- For the input `3 1 1 1 1 1 1`, the sorted list is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. The program picks `1`, `1`, and `1` (the first, third, and fifth elements) and adds them to the score, resulting in `3`.

These examples match the expected output, indicating that the program is correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the score by always picking the smallest number in each pair.

**Correctness: True**
