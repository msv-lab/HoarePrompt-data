Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a non-empty binary string input; `b` is a non-empty binary string input; `i` is 0; `j` is the index of the first occurrence of `a[0]` in `b` if it exists within the first `m` characters, otherwise `j` is `m`. Additionally, `j` is less than `m`; `k` is 1.**

The variable `k` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
