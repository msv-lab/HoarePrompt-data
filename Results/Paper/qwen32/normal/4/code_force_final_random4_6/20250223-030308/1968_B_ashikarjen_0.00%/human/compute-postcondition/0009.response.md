Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `m` must be at least 2; `a` is the new binary string input; `b` is the new binary string input such that `b[0] != a[0]`; `k` is 0; `j` is 2**.

The value of `j` has been incremented by 1, so `j` is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
