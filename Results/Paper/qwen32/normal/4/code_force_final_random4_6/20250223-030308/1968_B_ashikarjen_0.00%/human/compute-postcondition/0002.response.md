The code snippet `b = input()` assigns the value of the input to the variable `b`. The initial state specifies that `b` is a binary string of length `m`, but after the execution of the code, `b` will hold the new value provided by the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is the new binary string input; `b` is the new binary string input.**
