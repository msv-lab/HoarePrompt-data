Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is the new binary string input; `b` is the new binary string input; `k` is 0; `j` is the smallest integer such that `b[j] == a[i]` and `0 ≤ j < m`. The current value of `j` is less than `m`.**
