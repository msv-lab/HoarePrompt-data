To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head: `j < m` and `b[j] != a[i]`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is the new binary string input.
- `b` is the new binary string input.
- `i` is -1.
- `j` is 1.
- `b[0]` is not equal to `a[0]`.

Let's analyze the loop condition `j < m and b[j] != a[i]`.

1. **Condition `j < m`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `m`. Since `j` is currently 1, `m` must be greater than 1 to satisfy this condition.

2. **Condition `b[j] != a[i]`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is -1 and `b[j]` is `b[1]` (since `j` is 1).
   - Since `i` is -1, `a[i]` is out of bounds for the string `a` in Python (as negative indexing starts from the end of the string). However, for the sake of this loop condition, we can consider `a[i]` as not being a valid character in the string, or we can assume it is effectively treated as a condition that is always true because `a[-1]` would be the last character of `a`, which is not necessarily equal to `b[1]`.

Given these points, the only state we need to adjust is `m` to ensure `j < m` is true. No adjustments are necessary for `i` or `b[j]` because `i` being -1 makes `a[i]` an out-of-bounds reference, and `b[j]` is already defined as `b[1]`.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `m` must be greater than 1; `a` is the new binary string input; `b` is the new binary string input; `i` is -1; `j` is 1; `b[0]` is not equal to `a[0]`**.
