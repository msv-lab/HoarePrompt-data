Functionality: **The function `make_array` populates a portion of the `arr` array with a sequence of numbers from `left + 1` to `right + 1`, splitting this sequence into two parts: the first half in ascending order and the second half in descending order. It also assigns the value of `clique` to the corresponding elements in the `cliquess` array.**
