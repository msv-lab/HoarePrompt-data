The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `not_mid`. Since the loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`, we need to adjust the value of `i` for the next iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken a value from `0` to `not_mid - 2` (since the loop will execute while `i < not_mid`).

To execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. The other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`, and the array elements) do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 for the next iteration to occur.

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n`, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2` and must be greater than 0, `arr[left]` to `arr[left + mid - 1]` are `left + 1` to `left + mid`, `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are all `clique`, `arr[left + mid]` to `arr[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` are `big_element` to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique`, `i` is incremented by 1**
