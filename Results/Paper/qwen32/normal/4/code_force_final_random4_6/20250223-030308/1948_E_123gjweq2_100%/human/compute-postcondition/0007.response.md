The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `mid`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `mid`. If `i` is less than `mid`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1. The value of `mid` remains the same as it is determined by the initial conditions and does not change during the loop iterations.

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `i` is 1, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `left + 1 + i`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`.**
