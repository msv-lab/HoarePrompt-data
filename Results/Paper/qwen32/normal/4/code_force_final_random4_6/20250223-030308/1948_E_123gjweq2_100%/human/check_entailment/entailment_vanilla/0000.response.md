Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to:
1. Assign distinct integers from 1 to n to the vertices of a graph.
2. Add edges between vertices (i, j) if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| â‰¤ k.
3. Partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.
4. Print the assignments, the number of cliques, and the partitioning.

### Program Analysis:
The given program defines two functions:
1. `func_1(n, k)`: This function is supposed to assign values to vertices, determine the number of cliques, and print the required outputs.
2. `make_array(left, right, clique)`: This function is supposed to populate the array with values and assign clique numbers.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Global Variables**: The functions `func_1` and `make_array` use global variables `arr` and `cliquess` without defining them within the functions. This is not a good practice and can lead to errors if the variables are not defined outside the functions.
2. **Incorrect Clique Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`, which is not necessarily the minimum number of cliques required. The problem requires finding a partition into the minimum number of cliques.
3. **Incorrect Array Population**: The function `make_array` does not correctly populate the array `arr` and `cliquess`. It assigns values to the array but does not ensure that the graph formed by these values can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
4. **Output Format**: The program prints the output directly from within the function, which might not be the desired behavior if the program needs to handle multiple test cases correctly.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic for determining the number of cliques and assigning values to vertices is flawed, and it does not ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
