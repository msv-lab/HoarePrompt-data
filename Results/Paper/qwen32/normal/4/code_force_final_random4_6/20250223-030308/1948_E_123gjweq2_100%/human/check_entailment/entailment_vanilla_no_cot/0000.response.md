Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Global Variables**: The `arr` and `cliquess` arrays are used within the `make_array` function but are not defined as global variables, which will lead to an error when trying to modify them.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Number of Cliques**: The number of cliques is calculated using `ceil(n / k)`, which is not a correct approach for determining the minimum number of cliques for the given problem. The correct approach involves understanding the connectivity constraints and how they affect the partitioning of the graph into cliques.

3. **Incomplete Logic for Graph Connectivity**: The logic for assigning values to vertices and forming cliques based on the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| â‰¤ k` is not fully implemented. The current logic does not ensure that the graph is partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

4. **Output Format**: The output format for the partition of the graph into cliques is incorrect. The third line of the output should contain the partition of the graph into cliques, but the current implementation does not correctly assign the clique numbers to the vertices.

5. **Lack of Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle edge cases, such as when `k` is very small or very large relative to `n`.

To correct the program, one would need to implement a proper algorithm to assign values to vertices and partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques based on the given constraints.
