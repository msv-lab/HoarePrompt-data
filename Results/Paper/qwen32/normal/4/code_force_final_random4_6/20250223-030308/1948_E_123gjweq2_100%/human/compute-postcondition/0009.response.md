The code snippet provided is:
```python
cliquess[left + i] = clique
```

This line of code assigns the value of `clique` to the index `left + i` in the list `cliquess`. 

Based on the initial state, the value of `cliquess[left + i]` was already `clique`, so the assignment does not change the value of `cliquess[left + i]`. Therefore, no actual change occurs in the state of the variables.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `i` is 1, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `left + 1 + i`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`.**
