The function `func_1` takes two integer parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is between 2 and 40 inclusive, and `k` is between 1 and 2n inclusive. It calculates the ceiling of `n / k` and uses this value to fill two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, with segments of `k` elements each, filled with consecutive integers starting from 1 up to the calculated ceiling value. The function prints the elements of `arr`, the calculated ceiling value, and the elements of `cliquess`.
