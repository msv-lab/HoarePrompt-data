The code snippet assigns values to elements in the `arr` array starting from the index `left + mid + i` to `left + mid + (not_mid - 1)`. Specifically, it assigns the values `big_element - i` to these indices.

Given:
- `big_element` is `right + 1`
- `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`
- `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2` and is greater than 0

The loop (implied by the `i` variable) will run from `0` to `not_mid - 1`. Therefore, `arr[left + mid + i]` will be assigned `big_element - i` for `i` in the range `[0, not_mid - 1]`.

After the execution of the code snippet:
- `arr[left + mid]` is assigned `big_element`
- `arr[left + mid + 1]` is assigned `big_element - 1`
- ...
- `arr[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` is assigned `big_element - (not_mid - 1)`

The other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`, `arr[left]` to `arr[left + mid - 1]`, `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n`, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2` and must be greater than 0, `arr[left]` to `arr[left + mid - 1]` are `left + 1` to `left + mid`, `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are all `clique`, `arr[left + mid]` to `arr[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` are `big_element` to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)`**.
