To determine the output state after the loop executes all its iterations, let's analyze the loop and its effects step-by-step.

### Loop Analysis

The loop iterates `not_mid` times, where `not_mid` is calculated as `(right - left + 1) // 2`. The loop modifies the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays starting from index `left + mid` up to `left + mid + (not_mid - 1)`.

Here's what happens in each iteration:
- For `i` ranging from `0` to `not_mid - 1`:
  - `arr[left + mid + i]` is set to `big_element - i`.
  - `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is set to `clique`.

### Output State After All Iterations

After the loop completes all its iterations, the values in the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays will be as follows:
- `arr[left]` to `arr[left + mid - 1]` remain unchanged as `left + 1` to `left + mid`.
- `arr[left + mid]` to `arr[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` will be set to `big_element` to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)`, which means:
  - `arr[left + mid]` will be `big_element`
  - `arr[left + mid + 1]` will be `big_element - 1`
  - ...
  - `arr[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` will be `big_element - (not_mid - 1)`
- `cliquess[left + mid]` to `cliquess[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` will all be set to `clique`.

### Final Output State

The final output state after the loop has completed all iterations is:

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n`, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2` and must be greater than 0, `arr[left]` to `arr[left + mid - 1]` are `left + 1` to `left + mid`, `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are all `clique`, `arr[left + mid]` to `arr[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` are `big_element` to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)`, `cliquess[left + mid]` to `cliquess[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` are all `clique`.**

In simpler terms, the first half of the segment from `left` to `right` in `arr` remains unchanged, while the second half is filled with decreasing values from `big_element` to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)`. The corresponding `cliquess` values for both halves are set to `clique`.
