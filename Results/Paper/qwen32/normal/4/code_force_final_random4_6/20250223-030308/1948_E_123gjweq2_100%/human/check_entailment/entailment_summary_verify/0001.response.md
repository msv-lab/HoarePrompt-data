### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem requirements and the provided code step-by-step.

#### Problem Recap:
- **Vertices and Edges**: We have `n` vertices and need to assign distinct integers `a_i` from 1 to `n`.
- **Edge Condition**: An edge exists between vertices `i` and `j` if `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| â‰¤ k`.
- **Objective**: Partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques. Each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1(n, k)`**: This function calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)` and calls `make_array` to populate arrays `arr` and `cliquess`.
2. **`make_array(left, right, clique)`**: This function populates a portion of `arr` with a sequence of numbers from `left + 1` to `right + 1`, splitting it into two parts: the first half in ascending order and the second half in descending order. It also assigns the value of `clique` to the corresponding elements in `cliquess`.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Global Variables**: The arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are used as global variables, which can lead to unintended side effects and is not a good practice.
2. **Incorrect Clique Calculation**: The number of cliques is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`, which is not guaranteed to be the minimum number of cliques required. The correct approach involves ensuring that the graph can be partitioned into the fewest possible cliques.
3. **Incorrect Array Population**: The function `make_array` does not ensure that the resulting graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. It simply splits the sequence into two parts, which may not satisfy the edge condition for all pairs of vertices.
4. **Output Format**: The program prints the output directly from within the function, which might not be ideal for handling multiple test cases.

#### Function Summary Validation:
The function summary for `make_array` correctly describes its behavior: it populates a portion of `arr` with a sequence of numbers in a specific pattern and assigns the same clique number to these elements in `cliquess`. However, this behavior does not ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

#### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic for determining the number of cliques and assigning values to vertices is flawed, and it does not ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaws in the program. The program does not meet the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
