You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes a list of integers and a series of queries. Each query asks whether there exists a subarray within a specified range that has a bitwise XOR of zero. The function returns 'YES' if such a subarray exists and 'NO' otherwise for each query.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to carefully analyze if it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. 

The problem description asks us to determine whether a subarray can be divided into more than one part such that the bitwise XOR of all elements in each part is equal. The provided program reads multiple test cases, each containing an array and a series of queries. For each query, it determines if the specified subarray is "interesting" based on the XOR criteria.

Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The program calculates a prefix XOR array `pf` where `pf[i]` is the XOR of elements from the start of the array up to the `i`-th element. This is useful because the XOR of any subarray `a[l:r+1]` can be calculated as `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.

2. **Mapping Prefix XOR Values**: A dictionary `mp` is used to map each prefix XOR value to a list of indices where this value occurs. This helps in efficiently checking if there are valid splits in the subarray.

3. **Query Processing**: For each query, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` using the prefix XOR array. If this XOR value is 0, the subarray is trivially "interesting" because it can be split into any number of parts, each with XOR 0. If the XOR value is not 0, the program checks if there are indices in the prefix XOR array that allow for a valid split.

4. **Checking Valid Splits**: The program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find indices in the prefix XOR array that can serve as valid split points. If such indices exist, the subarray is considered "interesting".

### Analysis of Correctness

The logic of the program seems to be correct for the given problem description. Here's why:

- **Prefix XOR Calculation**: This is a standard technique to efficiently compute the XOR of any subarray.
- **Mapping Prefix XOR Values**: This helps in quickly identifying potential split points.
- **Query Processing**: The program correctly checks if the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR by leveraging the prefix XOR values and their indices.

### Testing the Program

Let's consider the provided example:

**Input:**
```
4
5 5
1 1 2 3 0
1 5
2 4
3 5
1 3
3 4
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 5
2 4
3 5
1 3
2 3
7 4
12 9 10 9 10 11 9
1 5
1 7
2 6
2 7
11 4
0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 2
2 5
6 9
7 11
```

**Output:**
```
YES
YES
NO
NO
NO
YES
NO
NO
YES
NO
NO
NO
NO
NO
YES
NO
YES
YES
```

The program produces the correct output for the provided example, which suggests that it handles the given cases correctly.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis and the provided example, the program appears to correctly determine whether subarrays are "interesting" according to the problem description. There are no obvious edge cases or potential issues with the logic.

**Correctness: True**. 

The program seems to handle all the necessary cases and produces the correct output for the provided example.
