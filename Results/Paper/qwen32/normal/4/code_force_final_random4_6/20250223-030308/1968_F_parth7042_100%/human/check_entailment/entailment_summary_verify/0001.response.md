### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to determine if a subarray can be split into two or more parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal. The program processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an array and a series of queries. For each query, it checks if the specified subarray can be split as required.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR (`pf`) for the array, where `pf[i]` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to the `i`-th element.
   - This is done using the formula: `pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`.

2. **Mapping Prefix XOR Values**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `mp` to map each prefix XOR value to the indices where it occurs.
   - This allows for efficient lookup of indices where a specific prefix XOR value appears.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query `(l, r)`, the program calculates `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, which is the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r+1]`.
   - If `x == 0`, it means the entire subarray can be trivially split into two parts with XOR 0, so the answer is "YES".
   - If `x != 0`, the program checks if there exists an index `i` in the subarray `[l, r]` such that `pf[i] == pf[l-1]` and there is another index `j` (where `l <= i < j <= r`) such that `pf[j] == pf[r]`. This would imply that the XOR of the subarray from `l` to `i` is equal to the XOR of the subarray from `i+1` to `r`.

4. **Binary Search**:
   - The program uses `bisect_left` to find the first index `it1` in `mp[pf[r]]` that is not less than `l`.
   - It also finds the last index `it2` in `mp[pf[l - 1]]` that is not greater than `r`.
   - If `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, it means there exists an index `i` such that `pf[i] == pf[l-1]` and there is another index `j` such that `pf[j] == pf[r]` and `l <= i < j <= r`.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary correctly describes the program's behavior for each query. It checks if the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR by verifying the conditions mentioned above.

#### Verification:
- **Correctness**: The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray can be split into two or more parts with the same XOR value.
- **Efficiency**: The use of prefix XOR and binary search ensures that the program efficiently handles the constraints, especially the large input sizes specified in the problem.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly solves the problem as described in the problem statement. It efficiently processes the input and provides the correct output for each query.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
