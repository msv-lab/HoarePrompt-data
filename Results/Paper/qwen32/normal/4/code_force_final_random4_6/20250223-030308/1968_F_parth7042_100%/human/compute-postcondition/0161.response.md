Output State: **`t` is an integer value of `data[0]` decremented by 2; `n` must be at least 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[1]` which is `int(data[index])`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is `index + 5`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element is 0; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[0]` contains the value `[0]`; `results` is a list containing the result of each of the `q` queries, either 'YES' or 'NO'; `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `index` is incremented by 1, so `index` becomes `index + 5` since it was previously `index + 4`. All other variables remain unchanged.
