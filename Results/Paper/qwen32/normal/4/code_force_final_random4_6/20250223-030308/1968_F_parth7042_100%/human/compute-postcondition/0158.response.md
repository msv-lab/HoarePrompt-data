Output State: **`t` is an integer value of `data[0]` decremented by 2; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is `index + 4`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element is 0; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[0]` contains the value `[0]`; `results` is a list containing the result of each of the `q` queries, either 'YES' or 'NO'**.

In simple terms, the value of `mp[0]` now contains the list `[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
