Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer value of `data[0]` and must be at least 0, decremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is `5 + 2 * n + 1`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[0]` now contains `[0]`; `results` is a list containing the result of each of the `q` queries, either 'YES' or 'NO'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer value of `data[0]` and must be at least 0, decremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]` and must be at least 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[index])`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is `6 + 2 * n + 1`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[pf[i]]` now contains `[0, i]` if `pf[i]` was `0` before, or `[i]` if `pf[i]` was not `0` before; `results` is a list containing the result of each of the `q` queries, either 'YES' or 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer value of `data[0]` and must be at least 0, decremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]` and must be at least 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `a` is a list of `n + 2` elements where the first `n + 1` elements are zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[index])` and `a[n + 1]` is also `int(data[index])`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is `7 + 2 * n + 1`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[pf[i]]` now contains `[0, i]` if `pf[i]` was `0` before, or `[i]` if `pf[i]` was not `0` before, and now includes `i` at the end; `results` is a list containing the result of each of the `q` queries, either 'YES' or 'NO'; `i` is `n + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer value of `data[0]` and must be at least 0, decremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]` and must be at least 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `a` is a list of `n + 2` elements where the first `n + 1` elements are zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[index])` and `a[n + 1]` is also `int(data[index])`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is `8 + 2 * n + 1`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[pf[i]]` now contains `[i, i]`; `results` is a list containing the result of each of the `q` queries, either 'YES' or 'NO'; `i` is `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
