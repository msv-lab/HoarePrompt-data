Output State: **`t` is an integer value of `data[0]` and must be at least 0, decremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is `5 + 2 * n + 1`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[0]` now contains `[0]`; `results` is a list containing the result of each of the `q` queries, either 'YES' or 'NO'.**

In simple terms, the output state is the same as the initial state except that the defaultdict `mp` now has an entry for the key `0` with the value `[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
