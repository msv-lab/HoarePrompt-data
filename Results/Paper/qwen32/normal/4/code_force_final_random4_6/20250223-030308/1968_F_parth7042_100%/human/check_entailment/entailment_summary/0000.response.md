Reasoning:
The program is designed to determine whether a subarray can be split into two or more parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal. The approach taken in the program involves using prefix XOR values and a dictionary to map these prefix XOR values to their respective indices. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The program calculates the prefix XOR for the array. The prefix XOR up to index `i` (denoted as `pf[i]`) is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i`. This helps in efficiently computing the XOR of any subarray.

2. **Mapping Prefix XOR Values**: A dictionary `mp` is used to map each prefix XOR value to a list of indices where this prefix XOR value occurs. This allows quick lookup of indices for a specific prefix XOR value.

3. **Processing Queries**:
   - For each query, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray from index `l` to `r` using the prefix XOR values: `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
   - If `x == 0`, it means the entire subarray from `l` to `r` has a XOR of zero, and thus it can trivially be split into two parts with XOR zero (by splitting at any point within the subarray). The program correctly returns 'YES' in this case.
   - If `x != 0`, the program checks if there exists an index `i` in the subarray from `l` to `r` such that the prefix XOR up to `i` (exclusive) is equal to the prefix XOR up to `r` (inclusive) XOR `x`. This would mean the subarray from `l` to `i` has the same XOR as the subarray from `i+1` to `r`, making the subarray interesting.
   - The program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to efficiently find such an index within the lists stored in the dictionary `mp`.

4. **Output**: The program collects the results for each query and prints them at the end.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values. The use of prefix XOR and binary search ensures that the program runs efficiently within the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
