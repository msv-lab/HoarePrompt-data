Output State: **`t` is an integer value of `data[0]` and must be at least 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` such that `q` is 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is `int(data[3 + i - 1])` and all other elements are 0; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is `3 + 2 * n + 1`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of `a[j]` for `j` from 1 to `i` and all other elements are 0; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list of indices where `pf` has the value `pf[i]`; `results` is a list containing the result of each of the `q` queries, either 'YES' or 'NO'.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `q` becomes 0 because all queries have been processed. The `index` variable will have advanced by `2 * q` positions since each query consumes two more elements from `data` (one for `l` and one for `r`). The `results` list will contain the answers ('YES' or 'NO') for each of the `q` queries that were processed. All other variables like `t`, `n`, `a`, `data`, `pf`, and `mp` remain unchanged from their initial states except for the `index` which reflects the number of queries processed.
