The code snippet initializes a `defaultdict` named `mp` with a default factory of `list`. This means that any key that does not exist in `mp` will automatically have a list as its value when accessed. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value of `data[0]` and must be at least 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 3; `results` is an empty list; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list`.**
