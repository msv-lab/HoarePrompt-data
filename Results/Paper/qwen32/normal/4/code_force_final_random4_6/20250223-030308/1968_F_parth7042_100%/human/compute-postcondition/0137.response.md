The code snippet `r = int(data[index + 1])` updates the value of `r` to the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. No other variables are affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value of `data[0]` decremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`; `q` is an integer value of `data[index - 1]` and must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and the subsequent `n` elements are the integer values of `data[index - 2]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is `index + 4`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and the subsequent `n` elements are the cumulative XOR of `a[j]` for `j` from 1 to `i`; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list of indices `i` where the cumulative XOR up to `i` is `pf[i]`; `results` is a list containing the result of each of the `q` queries, either 'YES' or 'NO'. The last element of `results` is 'YES' if `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, otherwise it is 'NO'. `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is the list of indices `i` where the cumulative XOR up to `i` is `pf[r]`; `v2` is the list of indices `i` where the cumulative XOR up to `i` is `pf[l - 1]` (updated from `mp[pf[l - 1]]`); `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`; `q` is `q - 1`; `it1` is the insertion point of `l` in `v1` found using `bisect_left`.**
