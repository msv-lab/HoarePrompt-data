Output State: **`t` is 0; `n` and `q` are the integers from the last test case processed; `a` is the list of integers from the last test case processed; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is the position in `data` after processing all test cases; `results` is a list containing the result of each of the queries from all test cases, either 'YES' or 'NO'.**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be 0 because it starts at the number of test cases and decrements by 1 with each iteration. The variables `n` and `q` will reflect the values from the last test case processed. The list `a` will contain the integers from the last test case. The `data` list remains unchanged as it is the initial input split into strings. The `index` will point to the position in `data` right after the last test case's data. Finally, `results` will be a list containing the answers ('YES' or 'NO') for each query from all test cases that were processed.
