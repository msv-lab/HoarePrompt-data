Let's walk through the reasoning step by step to determine the correctness of the provided Python program.

### Understanding the Problem
The problem requires us to determine if a subarray can be split into two or more parts where the bitwise XOR of the elements in each part is the same. We need to handle multiple test cases and multiple queries for each test case.

### Key Concepts in the Program
1. **Prefix XOR (pf)**: The program computes the prefix XOR for the array. `pf[i]` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to the `i`-th element.
2. **Mapping Prefix XOR Values (mp)**: The program uses a dictionary to map each prefix XOR value to the indices where it occurs.
3. **Query Handling**: For each query `(l, r)`, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` using the prefix XOR values: `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`. If `x == 0`, the subarray can be trivially split into two parts with the same XOR (since the entire subarray has an XOR of 0). Otherwise, the program checks if there exists an index `i` in the subarray where the prefix XOR up to `i` (exclusive) equals `pf[l-1]` and the prefix XOR up to `r` (inclusive) equals `pf[r]`. This would imply that the XOR of the subarray from `l` to `i` is equal to the XOR of the subarray from `i+1` to `r`.

### Detailed Explanation of the Program
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once and processes it in a loop for each test case.
2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: For each element in the array, the program calculates the prefix XOR and stores it in the `pf` array.
3. **Mapping Prefix XOR Values**: The program uses a dictionary `mp` to store the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.
4. **Processing Queries**: For each query `(l, r)`, the program calculates `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`. If `x == 0`, the answer is "YES". Otherwise, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find if there exists an index `i` in the subarray `[l, r]` such that `pf[i] == pf[l-1]` and `pf[r]` is present after `i`. If such an `i` exists, the answer is "YES"; otherwise, it is "NO".

### Correctness Verification
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray can be split into two or more parts with the same XOR value. It efficiently handles the prefix XOR calculation and uses a dictionary and binary search to quickly find the required indices for each query.

### Conclusion
The program is correct as it correctly handles the problem requirements and constraints. It efficiently processes the input and provides the correct output for each query.

Correctness: **True**
