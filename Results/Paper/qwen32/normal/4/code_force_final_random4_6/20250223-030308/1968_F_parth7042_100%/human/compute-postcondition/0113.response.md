The code snippet provided executes a binary search using `bisect_left` to find the insertion point for `l` in the list `v1`. This does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `data`, `index`, `pf`, `mp`, `results`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, or `v2`. The only new variable introduced is `it1`, which holds the result of the binary search.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value of `data[0]` decremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`; `q` is an integer value of `data[index - 1]` and must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and the subsequent `n` elements are the integer values of `data[index - 2]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is `index + 2`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and the subsequent `n` elements are the cumulative XOR of `a[j]` for `j` from 1 to `i`; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list of indices `i` where the cumulative XOR up to `i` is `pf[i]`; `results` is a list containing the result of each of the `q` queries, either 'YES' or 'NO', and if `x` equals 0, the last element of `results` is 'YES'; `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `r` is equal to `q`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is the list of indices `i` where the cumulative XOR up to `i` is `pf[r]`; `v2` is the list of indices `i` where the cumulative XOR up to `i` is `pf[l - 1]`; `it1` is the insertion point of `l` in `v1` found using `bisect_left`.**
