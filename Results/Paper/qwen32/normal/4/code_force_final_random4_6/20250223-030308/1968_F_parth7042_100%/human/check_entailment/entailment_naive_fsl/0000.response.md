To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to carefully analyze if it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. 

The problem description asks us to determine whether a subarray can be divided into more than one part such that the bitwise XOR of all elements in each part is equal. The provided program reads multiple test cases, each containing an array and a series of queries. For each query, it determines if the specified subarray is "interesting" based on the XOR criteria.

Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The program calculates a prefix XOR array `pf` where `pf[i]` is the XOR of elements from the start of the array up to the `i`-th element. This is useful because the XOR of any subarray `a[l:r+1]` can be calculated as `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.

2. **Mapping Prefix XOR Values**: A dictionary `mp` is used to map each prefix XOR value to a list of indices where this value occurs. This helps in efficiently checking if there are valid splits in the subarray.

3. **Query Processing**: For each query, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` using the prefix XOR array. If this XOR value is 0, the subarray is trivially "interesting" because it can be split into any number of parts, each with XOR 0. If the XOR value is not 0, the program checks if there are indices in the prefix XOR array that allow for a valid split.

4. **Checking Valid Splits**: The program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find indices in the prefix XOR array that can serve as valid split points. If such indices exist, the subarray is considered "interesting".

### Analysis of Correctness

The logic of the program seems to be correct for the given problem description. Here's why:

- **Prefix XOR Calculation**: This is a standard technique to efficiently compute the XOR of any subarray.
- **Mapping Prefix XOR Values**: This helps in quickly identifying potential split points.
- **Query Processing**: The program correctly checks if the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR by leveraging the prefix XOR values and their indices.

### Testing the Program

Let's consider the provided example:

**Input:**
```
4
5 5
1 1 2 3 0
1 5
2 4
3 5
1 3
3 4
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 5
2 4
3 5
1 3
2 3
7 4
12 9 10 9 10 11 9
1 5
1 7
2 6
2 7
11 4
0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 2
2 5
6 9
7 11
```

**Output:**
```
YES
YES
NO
NO
NO
YES
NO
NO
YES
NO
NO
NO
NO
NO
YES
NO
YES
YES
```

The program produces the correct output for the provided example, which suggests that it handles the given cases correctly.
