The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `c` and the current character `x` in the string. Since the loop iterates over each character in the string `c`, at the start of the next iteration, `x` should be the next character in the string after the current `x`.

Given that `x` is the next character in the string `c` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` should be updated to the subsequent character in the string `c`.

State: **`c` is a string with at least one character, `x` is the next character in the string `c`**.

However, to be more precise, if `x` was the last character in the string `c` during the previous iteration, then the loop would not execute again. Therefore, we should ensure that there are more characters left in the string `c` for `x` to be updated to.

State: **`c` is a string with at least two characters, `x` is the next character in the string `c`**.
