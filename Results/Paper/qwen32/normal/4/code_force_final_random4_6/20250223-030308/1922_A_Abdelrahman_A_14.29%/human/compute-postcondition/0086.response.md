Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the input string provided by the user, `c` is the new input string provided by the user, `slength` is the new input integer, `tests` is greater than 0, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `c` equals `a` or `c` equals `b`, then `no` is False. Otherwise, `no` is True if all characters in `c` are in either `a` or `b`, and `no` is False if there is at least one character in `c` that is not in `a` or `b`.**
