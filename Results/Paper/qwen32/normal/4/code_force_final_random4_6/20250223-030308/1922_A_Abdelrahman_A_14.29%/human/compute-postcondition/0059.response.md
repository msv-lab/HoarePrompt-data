The given `print` statement in the Python code snippet is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or conditions described in the initial state. The string `'NO'` is explicitly provided as the argument to the `print` function.

### Explanation:
- The string `'NO'` is a literal string and does not change based on the values of any variables or conditions in the initial state.
- The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `slength`, `tests`, and `i` are mentioned in the initial state but are not used in the `print` statement.
- The variable `no` is set to `True`, but it is also not used in the `print` statement.
- The condition that all characters in `c` are in either `a` or `b` is also not relevant to the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
