Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is the input string, `b` is the new input string, `c` is the new input string, `slength` is an input integer, `tests` is greater than 0. If `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, `no` is False. Otherwise, `no` is True.**
