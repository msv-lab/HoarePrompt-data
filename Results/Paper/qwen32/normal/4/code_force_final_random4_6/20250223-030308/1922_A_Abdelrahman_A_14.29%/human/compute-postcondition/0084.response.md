Postcondition: **`c` is a string with at least two characters, `x` is the next character in the string `c`. If `x` is not in `a` and `x` is not in `b`, then `no` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `no` remains unchanged and the loop or if statement does not break.**
