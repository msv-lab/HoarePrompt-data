Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is the input string, `b` is the new input string, `c` is the new input string, `slength` is an input integer, `tests` must be greater than 0, `no` is False, and `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`.**

In this output state, the variable `no` has been changed from `True` to `False`. All other variables retain their initial state values.
