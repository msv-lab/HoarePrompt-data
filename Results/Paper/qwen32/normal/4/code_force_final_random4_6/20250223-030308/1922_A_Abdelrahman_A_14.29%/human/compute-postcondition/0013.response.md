The `print('YES')` statement will output the string 'YES' regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `slength`, `tests`, `no`, and `x` as defined in the initial state. The print statement is a simple output command that does not depend on any of the variables or their values.

Output: **YES**
