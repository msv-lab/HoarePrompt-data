You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):

        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:
                    print('YES')
                    no = False
                    break
        if no:
            print('NO')

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, `tests` is an input integer, and the loop has executed `tests` times. After each iteration, if `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, the output is 'NO'. Otherwise, if `c` contains at least one character not present in either `a` or `b`, the output is 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three strings of equal length. For each test case, it determines if the third string contains at least one character not present in either of the first two strings. If such a character exists, it outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the given program step by step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine if there exists a template `t` such that:
- Strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
- String `c` does not match the template `t`.

The template `t` can have both lowercase and uppercase letters. If the template has a lowercase letter, the corresponding letter in the strings must be the same. If the template has an uppercase letter, the corresponding letter in the strings must be different from the lowercase version of the template letter.

### Program Analysis

The provided program takes the following approach:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `n`, and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Initial Check for `c == a` or `c == b`:**
   - If `c` is the same as `a` or `b`, it immediately prints "NO".
   - This check is correct because if `c` is identical to either `a` or `b`, it would be impossible to find a template that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`.

3. **Checking for a Template:**
   - If `c` is not identical to `a` or `b`, the program then checks if there exists any character in `c` that is not present in both `a` and `b`.
   - If such a character exists, it prints "YES", indicating that a template can be constructed where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.
   - If no such character is found, it prints "NO".

### Issues in the Program

The issue with the provided program is that the check for a template is not sufficient. The program only checks if there is a character in `c` that is not in `a` and `b`. However, this is not enough to guarantee that a template can be constructed where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that for each position `i` in the strings:
- If `a[i] == b[i]`, then the template character at position `i` must be uppercase (since `c[i]` must be different).
- If `a[i] != b[i]`, then the template character at position `i` can be set to either `a[i]` or `b[i]` (both lowercase), ensuring that `c[i]` does not match.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly determine the existence of a valid template. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
