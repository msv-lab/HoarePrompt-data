Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, `tests` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(tests):
    slength = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    c = input()
    no = True
    if c == a or c == b:
        no = False
        print('NO')
    else:
        for x in c:
            if x not in a and x not in b:
                print('YES')
                no = False
                break
    if no:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is the input string, `b` is the new input string, `c` is the new input string, `slength` is an input integer, `tests` is greater than 0. If `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, `no` is False. Otherwise, `no` is True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` and `b` are input strings, `c` is the input string, `slength` is the input integer, `tests` is greater than 0, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `no` is True, then all characters in `c` are in either `a` or `b`. If `no` is False, then either `c` equals `a` or `c` equals `b`, or there is at least one character in `c` that is not in `a` or `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the input string provided by the user, `c` is the new input string provided by the user, `slength` is the new input integer, `tests` is greater than 0, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `no` is True, then `c` contains at least one character not present in either `a` or `b`, or `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
