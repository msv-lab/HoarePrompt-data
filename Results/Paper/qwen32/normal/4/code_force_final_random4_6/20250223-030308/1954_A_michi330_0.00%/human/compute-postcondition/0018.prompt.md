Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 ≤ `m`, `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 50) where `n` is the number of parts of the ribbon, `m` is the number of colors, and `k` is the number of parts Bob can repaint. `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for itest in range(0, t, 1):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('Yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `itest` is 0, `t` is at least 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input. Either `n` is less than or equal to `k`, or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`. Otherwise, `n` is greater than `k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `itest` is 1, `t` is at least 2, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input. If `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, the condition of the if statement is satisfied. Otherwise, the condition of the else statement is satisfied. In both cases, the values of `itest`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `itest` is 2, `t` is at least 3, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input. If `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, the condition in the if statement holds. Otherwise, the condition in the else part holds, but since the else part does not alter any variables, the state remains the same as the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
