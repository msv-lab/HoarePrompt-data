Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` where `n` is the number of parts of the ribbon, `m` is the number of colors, and `k` is the number of parts Bob can repaint. The function returns the maximum number of parts of the ribbon that can be made to have the same color after repainting up to `k` parts.**
