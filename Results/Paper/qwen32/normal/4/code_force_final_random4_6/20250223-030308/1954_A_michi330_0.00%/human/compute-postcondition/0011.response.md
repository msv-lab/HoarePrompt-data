The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state describes the values and conditions of several variables (`itest`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the content of the `print` statement itself.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('Yes')`.
2. This statement directly outputs the string `'Yes'`.
3. None of the variables `itest`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `k` are referenced in the `print` statement, so their values do not affect the output.

Thus, the output of the code is simply the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
