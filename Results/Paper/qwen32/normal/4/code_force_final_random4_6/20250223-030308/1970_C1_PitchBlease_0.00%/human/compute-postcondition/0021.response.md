The loop condition in the given `while` loop is `while queue:`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as the `queue` is not empty. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, the `queue` must contain at least one element.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `queue` contains tuples of unvisited neighbors with their distances.
- `visited` contains all visited nodes.
- `current` is `start`.
- `dist` is 0.
- `start` and `target` remain unchanged.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `queue` is not empty. Since we are not making any assumptions about the content of `queue` other than it should contain at least one element, we can simply state that `queue` must contain at least one tuple of unvisited neighbors with their distances.

State: **`queue` must contain at least one tuple of unvisited neighbors with their distances, `visited` contains all visited nodes, `current` is `start`, `dist` is 0, `start` and `target` remain unchanged.**
