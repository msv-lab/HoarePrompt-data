Postcondition: **`queue` contains at least one less tuple of unvisited neighbors with their distances, `visited` contains all visited nodes, `current` is the first node from the `queue`, `dist` is the distance from the `start` to `current`, `start` and `target` remain unchanged. If `current` equals `target`, the program returns the distance from `start` to `current`, which is `dist`. Otherwise, the program does not return and continues with the remaining logic.**
