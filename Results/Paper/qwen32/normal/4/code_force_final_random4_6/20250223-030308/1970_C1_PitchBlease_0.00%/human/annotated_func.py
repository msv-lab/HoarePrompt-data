#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, edges is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers u and v such that 1 <= u, v <= n, and start is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n.

        tree[u].append(v)

    #State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers u and v such that 1 <= u, v <= n, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `tree` is a defaultdict with lists as default values, and for each tuple (u, v) in `edges`, `tree[u]` includes `v` as an additional element in its list, and `tree[v]` includes `u` as an additional element in its list.

        #The program returns 'Hermione'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` representing the number of nodes, a list of tuples `edges` representing the edges between the nodes, and an integer `start` representing the starting node. It constructs an undirected graph from the edges and determines the shortest distances from the starting node to two leaf nodes. Based on these distances, it returns 'Ron' if at least one of the distances is even, otherwise it returns 'Hermione'.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, target is an integer representing the target node to reach within the tree. The tree is an adjacency list where each key is a node and its value is a list of neighboring nodes.
def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: `queue` is empty, `visited` contains all reachable nodes from `start`, `current` is the `target`, `dist` is the distance from `start` to `target`, `start` and `target` remain unchanged.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `bfs` performs a Breadth-First Search to find the shortest path from a starting node (`start`) to a target node (`target`) in a tree represented as an adjacency list. It returns the distance from `start` to `target` if the target is reachable, or -1 if it is not. If `start` and `target` are the same, it returns 0.
