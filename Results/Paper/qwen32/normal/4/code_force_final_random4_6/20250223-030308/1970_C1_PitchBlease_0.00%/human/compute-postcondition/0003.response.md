The code snippet `current, dist = queue.popleft()` removes the leftmost element from the `queue` and unpacks it into the variables `current` and `dist`. Given the initial state, the `queue` contains a single tuple `(start, 0)`. Therefore, after executing the code, `current` will be assigned the value of `start`, and `dist` will be assigned the value `0`. The `queue` will be empty after this operation, and the `visited` set will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node to reach within the tree. The tree is an adjacency list where each key is a node and its value is a list of neighboring nodes. The queue is a deque that is now empty. `visited` is a set containing the single element `start`. `current` is equal to `start`. `dist` is 0.**
