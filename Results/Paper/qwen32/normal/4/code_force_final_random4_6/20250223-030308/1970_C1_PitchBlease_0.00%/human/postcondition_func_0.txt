The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` representing the number of nodes, a list of tuples `edges` representing the edges between the nodes, and an integer `start` representing the starting node. It constructs an undirected graph from the edges and determines the shortest distances from the starting node to two leaf nodes. Based on these distances, it returns 'Ron' if at least one of the distances is even, otherwise it returns 'Hermione'.
