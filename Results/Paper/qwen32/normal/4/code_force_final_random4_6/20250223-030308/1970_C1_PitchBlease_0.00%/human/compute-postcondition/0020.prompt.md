Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node to reach within the tree. The tree is an adjacency list where each key is a node and its value is a list of neighboring nodes. The queue is a deque that is now empty. `visited` is a set containing the single element `start`. `current` is equal to `start`. `dist` is 0. `current` is not equal to `target`.
Code of the loop:
for neighbor in tree[current]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
        visited.add(neighbor)
        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node to reach within the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list where each key is a node and its value is a list of neighboring nodes with `start` having at least one neighbor, `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0, `current` is not equal to `target`. If `neighbor` was not in `visited`, `queue` is a deque containing the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` and `visited` is a set containing the elements `start` and `neighbor`. If `neighbor` was already in `visited`, `queue` and `visited` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node to reach within the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list where each key is a node and its value is a list of neighboring nodes with `start` having at least one neighbor, `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0, `current` is not equal to `target`. If `neighbor` was not in `visited`, `queue` includes the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` and `visited` includes `neighbor`. If `neighbor` was already in `visited`, `queue` and `visited` remain unchanged. `neighbor` is the next neighbor in `tree[current]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node to reach within the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list where each key is a node and its value is a list of neighboring nodes with `start` having at least one neighbor, `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0, `current` is not equal to `target`, `neighbor` is the next neighbor in `tree[current]`. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `visited` includes `neighbor` and `queue` includes `(neighbor, dist + 1)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
