Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

# Annotated Functions:
from collections import deque, defaultdict

(n, t) = map(int, input().split())
edges = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n - 1)]
starts = list(map(int, input().split()))
start = starts[0]
print(func_1(n, edges, start))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, edges is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers u and v such that 1 <= u, v <= n, and start is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n.
def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers u and v such that 1 <= u, v <= n, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `tree` is a defaultdict with lists as default values, and for each tuple (u, v) in `edges`, `tree[u]` includes `v` as an additional element in its list, and `tree[v]` includes `u` as an additional element in its list.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 0 or dist2 % 2 == 0) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns 'Ron'
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns 'Hermione'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` representing the number of nodes, a list of tuples `edges` representing the edges between the nodes, and an integer `start` representing the starting node. It constructs an undirected graph from the edges and determines the shortest distances from the starting node to two leaf nodes. Based on these distances, it returns 'Ron' if at least one of the distances is even, otherwise it returns 'Hermione'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, target is an integer representing the target node to reach within the tree. The tree is an adjacency list where each key is a node and its value is a list of neighboring nodes.
def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: `queue` is empty, `visited` contains all reachable nodes from `start`, `current` is the `target`, `dist` is the distance from `start` to `target`, `start` and `target` remain unchanged.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `bfs` performs a Breadth-First Search to find the shortest path from a starting node (`start`) to a target node (`target`) in a tree represented as an adjacency list. It returns the distance from `start` to `target` if the target is reachable, or -1 if it is not. If `start` and `target` are the same, it returns 0.
