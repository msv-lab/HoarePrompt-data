The only variable in the loop head is `neighbor`. According to the code, the loop iterates over each `neighbor` in `tree[current]`. To execute one more time, there must be another `neighbor` in `tree[current]` that has not yet been processed in this iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `current` is the first node from the `queue`, and `tree[current]` must have at least one neighbor. Since the loop has already processed one neighbor, there must be at least one more neighbor in `tree[current]` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`queue` contains at least one tuple of unvisited neighbors with their distances, `visited` contains all visited nodes, `current` is the first node from the `queue` and `tree[current]` must have at least two neighbors, `dist` is the distance from the `start` to `current`, `start` and `target` remain unchanged. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `visited` includes `neighbor` and `queue` has an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`**
