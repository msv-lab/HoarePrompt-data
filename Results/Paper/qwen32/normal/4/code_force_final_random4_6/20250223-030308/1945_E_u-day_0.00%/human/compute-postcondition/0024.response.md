To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop condition `low + 1 < high`. 

Here's the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.
- `low` is 0 if `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, otherwise `low` is `(n - 1) // 2`.
- `high` is `(n - 1) // 2` if `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, otherwise `high` is `n - 1`.
- `st` is a set containing the value `(n - 1) // 2`.
- `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `low + 1 < high` must be true. We need to adjust only `low` and `high` to satisfy this condition.

### Analysis:
- If `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, then:
  - `low` is 0.
  - `high` is `(n - 1) // 2`.
  - We need `0 + 1 < (n - 1) // 2` to be true.
- If `arr[mid]` is not greater than `k`, then:
  - `low` is `(n - 1) // 2`.
  - `high` is `n - 1`.
  - We need `((n - 1) // 2) + 1 < n - 1` to be true.

Given these conditions, we need to ensure that the difference between `high` and `low` is at least 2. 

### Adjustment:
- If `low` is 0, then `high` must be at least 2.
- If `low` is `(n - 1) // 2`, then `high` must be at least `((n - 1) // 2) + 2`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `n`, we can adjust `high` in a way that ensures the loop condition is met in both scenarios:
- If `low` is 0, set `high` to 2.
- If `low` is `(n - 1) // 2`, set `high` to `((n - 1) // 2) + 2`.

However, to simplify and ensure generality, we can just ensure that `high` is at least `low + 2`.

### Final State:
The only variables we need to adjust are `low` and `high` to meet the condition `low + 1 < high`.

State: **`pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`; `low` is 0 if `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, otherwise `low` is `(n - 1) // 2`; `high` is at least `low + 2`; `st` is a set containing the value `(n - 1) // 2`; `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`**.
