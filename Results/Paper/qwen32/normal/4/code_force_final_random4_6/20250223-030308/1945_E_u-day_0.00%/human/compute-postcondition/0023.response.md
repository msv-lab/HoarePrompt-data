Postcondition: **`pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`; `low` is 0 if `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, otherwise `low` is `(n - 1) // 2`; `high` is `(n - 1) // 2` if `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, otherwise `high` is `n - 1`; `st` is a set containing the value `(n - 1) // 2`; `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`.**
