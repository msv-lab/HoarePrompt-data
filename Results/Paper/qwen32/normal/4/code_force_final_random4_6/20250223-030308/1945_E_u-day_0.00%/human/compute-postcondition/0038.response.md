Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`pos`**: The index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`. 
2. **`low` and `high`**: These are two consecutive indices such that `low + 1 == high`.
3. **`st`**: A set containing all the midpoints calculated during a loop.
4. **`arr[low]`**: The current value at index `low` in the array `arr` is `k`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(0)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement is simply `print(0)`. This means that regardless of the values of `pos`, `low`, `high`, `st`, and `arr`, the output of this statement will always be `0`.
- The variables `pos`, `low`, `high`, `st`, and `arr` are not used in the print statement, so their values do not affect the output.

### Conclusion:
The output of the print statement is simply `0`.

Output: **0**
