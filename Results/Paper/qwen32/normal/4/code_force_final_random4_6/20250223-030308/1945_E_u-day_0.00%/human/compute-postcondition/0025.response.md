The code calculates a new value for `mid` based on the current values of `low` and `high`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `mid` is initially set to `(n - 1) // 2`, and `low` is either `0` or `(n - 1) // 2`, and `high` is at least `low + 2`, the new `mid` will be recalculated as the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2.

Output State: **`pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`; `low` is 0 if `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, otherwise `low` is `(n - 1) // 2`; `high` is at least `low + 2`; `st` is a set containing the value `(n - 1) // 2`; `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`**.
