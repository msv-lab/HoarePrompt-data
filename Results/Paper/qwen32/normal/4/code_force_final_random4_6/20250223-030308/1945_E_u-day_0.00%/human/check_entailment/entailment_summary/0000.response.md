### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided functions step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We have a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` to find.
   - We can perform up to 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation.
   - We need to perform a binary search to find `x` in the permutation.
   - After the binary search, the element at index `l` should be equal to `x`.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):** Reads a line of input and returns a map of integers.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):** Converts the map returned by `func_1` into a list.
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):** 
     - Reads `n` and `k` (the length of the permutation and the number to find).
     - Reads the permutation array `arr`.
     - Finds the position of `k` in `arr` and stores it in `pos`.
     - Performs a binary search to find the position `low` where the binary search would stop.
     - If `arr[low]` equals `k`, it prints `0` (no swaps needed).
     - Otherwise, it prints `1` and the indices to swap (`low + 1` and `pos + 1`).

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The function `func_3` correctly identifies the position of `k` in the permutation.
   - It performs a binary search and determines the final `low` index.
   - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, it suggests swapping `arr[low]` with `arr[pos]` to ensure that `arr[low]` is `k` after the swap.
   - This approach ensures that after performing the binary search, `arr[low]` will be `k` if a swap is needed, and the swap is performed only once.
   - The problem states that 2 swaps are always sufficient, but in this case, the function ensures the result with 1 swap when necessary, which is within the allowed limit.

### Conclusion:

The provided functions together meet the problem description by correctly identifying when a swap is needed and performing it to ensure that the binary search will find `k` at the correct position. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
