Output State: **`pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`; `low` is now equal to `mid`; `high` is at least `low + 2`; `st` is a set containing `(n - 1) // 2` and `mid`; `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.**

In this output state, the variable `low` has been updated to the value of `mid`. The other variables, including `pos`, `high`, `st`, and `mid`, retain their previously defined states with the new value of `low` factored in for `mid` recalculation.
