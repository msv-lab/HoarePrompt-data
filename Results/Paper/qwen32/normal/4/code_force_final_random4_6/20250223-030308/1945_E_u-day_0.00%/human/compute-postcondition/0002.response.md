The code snippet provided initializes the variable `pos` to `-1`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` are not modified by this line of code. Therefore, the output state retains the initial values of `n`, `k`, and `arr`, with `pos` now set to `-1`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is -1**.
