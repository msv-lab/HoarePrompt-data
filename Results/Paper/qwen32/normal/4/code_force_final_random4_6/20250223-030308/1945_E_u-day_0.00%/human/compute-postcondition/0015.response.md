The code snippet `st = set()` creates a new empty set named `st`. This operation does not affect the values of `pos`, `low`, `high`, or `n`. Therefore, the output state remains the same for `pos`, `low`, and `high`, while `st` is introduced as an empty set.

Output State: **`pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`; `low` is 0; `high` is `n - 1`; `st` is an empty set.**
