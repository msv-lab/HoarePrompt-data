You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    return list(func_1())

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    (n, k) = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i

    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        st.add(mid)
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function determines the position of the value `k` in a permutation array `arr` of length `n`. It prints `0` if `k` is found at the position indicated by `low`, otherwise, it prints `1` followed by the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`, where `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `-1` if `k` is not found.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to rearrange a permutation `p` of size `n` using at most 2 swaps such that after performing a binary search for a given number `x`, the element at index `l` (found by the binary search) is equal to `x`. The binary search algorithm is defined in the problem statement, and it involves maintaining two pointers `l` and `r` and adjusting them based on the middle element `m`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program consists of three functions:
1. `func_1()`: Reads a line of input and splits it into a map of integers.
2. `func_2()`: Reads a line of input, splits it into a map of integers, and converts it into a list.
3. `func_3()`: This is the main function that handles each test case.

Let's break down `func_3()`:
- It reads `n` and `x` (the length of the permutation and the number to find).
- It reads the permutation `arr`.
- It searches for the position `pos` of `x` in `arr`.
- It initializes `low` and `high` pointers for binary search.
- It performs the binary search, adding the middle index `mid` to a set `st` (which is not used further).
- After the loop, it checks if `arr[low]` is equal to `x`. If so, it prints `0` (no swaps needed). Otherwise, it prints `1` (one swap needed) and suggests swapping `low + 1` with `pos + 1`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search implementation does not correctly identify the index `l` that would be returned by the binary search algorithm described in the problem statement. The problem statement specifies that the loop continues until `r - l = 1`, and the final `l` is the one that should be checked against `x`. However, the provided code does not ensure that the final `l` is correctly identified.
2. **Inefficient and Incomplete Swap Logic**: The program suggests a swap only if `arr[low]` is not equal to `x`. However, it does not guarantee that after this swap, the binary search will correctly identify `x` at `l`. The problem guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient, but the provided code does not ensure this with its current logic.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The binary search implementation and the swap logic need to be adjusted to ensure that after at most 2 swaps, the binary search correctly identifies `x` at `l`.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:
Correctness: **False**
