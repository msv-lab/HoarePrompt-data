Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program's logic is flawed as it only considers extending the same value from the left and right ends of the array, but it does not account for all possible ways to make the entire array equal with a single operation.

For example, in the test case `6 1 2 3 4 5 1`, the program will consider extending the `1` from the left and the `1` from the right, which would result in an incorrect answer of `4` instead of the correct answer of `4` (which can be achieved by setting the middle four elements to `1` or `5`).

The correct approach would involve checking all possible values in the array and determining the minimum cost to make the entire array equal to each of those values. This requires a more comprehensive algorithm that evaluates the cost of setting the array to each unique value present in the array.
