To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the `while` loop statement:

```
while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions are true:
1. `l < r`
2. `a[l] == a[l + 1]`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (this variable is not part of the loop head and does not need adjustment).
- `n` must be greater than 2 (this variable is not part of the loop head and does not need adjustment).
- `a` is a list of integers where `a[0] == a[1] == a[2]`.
- `le` is the length of the list `a` (this variable is not part of the loop head and does not need adjustment).
- `l` is 2.
- `r` is `n - 1`.
- `st` is 3 (this variable is not part of the loop head and does not need adjustment).
- `end` is 1 (this variable is not part of the loop head and does not need adjustment).
- `ans` retains its original value (this variable is not part of the loop head and does not need adjustment).

Let's analyze the conditions:
1. `l < r`:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `l` is 2 and `r` is `n - 1`. Since `n` must be greater than 2, `r` is at least 1. Therefore, `l < r` is true if `n` is at least 3. Since `n` is greater than 2, this condition is satisfied.

2. `a[l] == a[l + 1]`:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `l` is 2. So, we need `a[2] == a[3]`.
   - Given that `a[0] == a[1] == a[2]`, we need to ensure `a[2] == a[3]` for the loop to continue executing. This means `a[3]` must be equal to `a[2]`.

To make sure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `a` so that `a[3] == a[2]`.

Thus, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` must be greater than 2; `a` is a list of integers where `a[0] == a[1] == a[2] == a[3]`; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is 2; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 3; `end` is 1; `ans` retains its original value.**
