The code snippet calculates the length of the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `le`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged, while `le` is now the length of the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input; `le` is the length of the list `a`.**
