To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop based on the provided initial and intermediate states.

### Analysis:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (unchanged).
   - `n`: An input integer (unchanged).
   - `a`: A list of integers read from the input (unchanged).
   - `le`: The length of the list `a` (unchanged).
   - `l`: The index of the first element that is not equal to its subsequent element, or `n - 1` if all elements are equal (unchanged).
   - `r`: `n - 1` (initially).
   - `st`: The count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element (unchanged).
   - `end`: 1 (initially).
   - `ans`: Retains its original value (unchanged).

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - `while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:`

3. **Loop Body:**
   - `r -= 1`
   - `end += 1`

4. **Intermediate States:**
   - After 1 iteration: `r` is `n - 2`, `end` is 2.
   - After 2 iterations: `r` is `n - 3`, `end` is 3.
   - After 3 iterations: `r` is `n - 4`, `end` is 4.

### Conclusion:
- The loop continues to decrement `r` and increment `end` until either `r` is no longer greater than `l` or `a[r]` is not equal to `a[r - 1]`.
- The loop terminates when `r` reaches `l` or when a pair of consecutive elements that are not equal is found.

### Final Output State:
- The loop will terminate when `r` is equal to `l` or `a[r]` is not equal to `a[r - 1]`.
- Given the pattern in the intermediate states, the loop will terminate when `r` reaches `l` if all elements from `r` to `l + 1` are equal.
- `end` will be the count of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list until the first element that is not equal to its subsequent element.

### Final Output State in the Required Format:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is an index such that `l < n - 1` and `a[l] != a[l + 1]`, `r` is `l`, `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element, `end` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list until the first element that is not equal to its subsequent element, `ans` retains its original value.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
The loop will continue to decrement `r` and increment `end` until `r` reaches `l` or a pair of consecutive elements that are not equal is found. At the end of the loop, `r` will be equal to `l`, and `end` will represent the count of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list until the first element that is not equal to its subsequent element. All other variables remain unchanged.
