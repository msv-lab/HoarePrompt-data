The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a conventional way to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. The loop runs a number of times equal to the integer value obtained from `input()`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state such that the input value is a positive integer.

Given the problem statement, `t` is already defined as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, which means the input value is already within the correct range for the loop to execute `t` times.

Thus, no adjustment is needed for the variables within the loop head itself, but we must ensure that the input function will return `t`. Since `t` is already defined as the number of test cases, we can state that the input function will return `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
