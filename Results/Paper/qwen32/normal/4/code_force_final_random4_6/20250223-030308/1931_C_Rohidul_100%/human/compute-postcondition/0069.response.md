Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements where `a[0] == a[1]`, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 1, `end` is 1, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))` if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`**

Explanation: The value of `l` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
