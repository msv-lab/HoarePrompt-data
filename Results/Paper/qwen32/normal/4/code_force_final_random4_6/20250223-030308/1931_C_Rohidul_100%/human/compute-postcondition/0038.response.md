The value of `l` is incremented by 1. Other variables are not affected. Since `l` was initially 0, it is now 1. All other conditions and variable values remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers where `a[0] == a[1]`; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is 1; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 1; `end` is 1; `ans` retains its original value**.
