Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the new list of integers read from the input, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 1, `end` is 1, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))` if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`**

Natural language: The values of `st` and `end` have been set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is recalculated based on the new values of `st` and `end`.
