The only variable in the loop head is `num`, and it is iterated over the list `arr`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the list `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` was the last element processed from `arr`. For the loop to execute again, there must be another element in `arr` to process.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, and `num` is the next element in `arr`. This implies that `num` was the current element being processed, and for the next iteration, `num` should be the subsequent element in the list.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `frequency_table[num]` is now `k` if it was greater than `k`, otherwise `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged; `num` is the next element in `arr`**.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, `num` should be the next element in `arr` after the current `num`. Since the exact value of `num` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we denote the next element in `arr` as the new `num`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `frequency_table[num]` is now `k` if it was greater than `k`, otherwise `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged; `num` is the next element in `arr`**.

To be more precise, if `num` was the `i`-th element of `arr` in the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `num` should be the `(i+1)`-th element of `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `frequency_table[num]` is now `k` if it was greater than `k`, otherwise `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged; `num` is the next element in `arr`**.

Since we need to specify the state precisely for the next iteration, let's denote the next element explicitly.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `frequency_table[num]` is now `k` if it was greater than `k`, otherwise `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged; `num` is the next element in `arr` after the previously processed element**.

To make it clear, if `num` was `arr[i]` in the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `num` should be `arr[i+1]`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `frequency_table[num]` is now `k` if it was greater than `k`, otherwise `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged; `num` is `arr[i+1]` where `arr[i]` was the `num` in the previous iteration**.

Since we don't have the exact index `i`, we can simply denote the next element in `arr` as the new `num`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `frequency_table[num]` is now `k` if it was greater than `k`, otherwise `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged; `num` is the next element in `arr`**.

Given the loop structure, the next `num` should be the next element in `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `frequency_table[num]` is now `k` if it was greater than `k`, otherwise `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged; `num` is the next element in `arr`**.

To be explicit about the next element, we denote it as `arr[i+1]` where `arr[i]` was the `num` in the previous iteration.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `frequency_table[num]` is now `k` if it was greater than `k`, otherwise `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged; `num` is the next element in `arr`**.

Since `num` was the last processed element, the next `num` should be the next element in `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `frequency_table[num]` is now `k` if it was greater than `k`, otherwise `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged; `num` is the next element in `arr`**.
