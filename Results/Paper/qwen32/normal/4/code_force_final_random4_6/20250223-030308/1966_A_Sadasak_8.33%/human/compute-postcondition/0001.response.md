In the given task, the for loop iterates over `arr`, which is a list of integers. The only variable in the loop head is `num`, which will take on the value of each element in `arr` during each iteration. The variables `arr`, `k`, `t`, `n`, and `frequency_table` are not in the loop head, so we can't adjust their states directly to ensure the loop executes.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `arr` has at least one element. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **`arr`**: This is the list that the loop iterates over. For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one element.
2. **`num`**: This variable will take the value of each element in `arr` during each iteration. We don't need to adjust `num` before the loop starts since it is set by the loop itself.

Given the constraints and the requirement to only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we only need to ensure that `arr` has at least one element.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of integers in arr for the current test case, and `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary**.

Since only `arr` is in the loop head, and we need to ensure that the loop executes, we adjust `arr` to have at least one element.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one element**.
