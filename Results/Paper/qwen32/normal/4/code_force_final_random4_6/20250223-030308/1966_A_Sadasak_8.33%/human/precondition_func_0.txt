arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the number written on a card, and k is an integer representing the number of cards to exchange during each operation such that 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 2 <= k <= 100. The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first integer t (1 <= t <= 500) indicates the number of test cases, and each test case is described by two lines: the first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers representing the numbers on the cards.
