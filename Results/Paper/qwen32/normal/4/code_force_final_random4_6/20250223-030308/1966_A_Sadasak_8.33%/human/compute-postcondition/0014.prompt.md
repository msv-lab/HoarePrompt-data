Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number written on a card, and `k` is an integer representing the number of cards to exchange during each operation such that 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 2 <= k <= 100. The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500) indicates the number of test cases, and each test case is described by two lines: the first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, and the second line contains `n` integers representing the numbers on the cards. `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for num in arr:
    frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
    if frequency_table[num] > k:
        frequency_table[num] = k


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element. If `frequency_table[num]` was greater than `k`, it is now set to `k`. Otherwise, `frequency_table[num]` retains its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `frequency_table[num]` is now `k` if it was greater than `k`, otherwise `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged; `num` is the next element in `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `frequency_table[num]` is now `k` if it was originally `k + 1`, otherwise `frequency_table[num]` remains `1`; `num` is the next element in `arr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
