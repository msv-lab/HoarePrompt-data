You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the number written on a card, and k is an integer representing the number of cards to exchange during each operation such that 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 2 <= k <= 100. The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first integer t (1 <= t <= 500) indicates the number of test cases, and each test case is described by two lines: the first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers representing the numbers on the cards.
def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
        
        if frequency_table[num] > k:
            frequency_table[num] = k
        
    #State: `arr` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, and `frequency_table` is a dictionary with each unique number from `arr` as keys and their counts (capped at `k`) as values.
    return frequency_table
    #The program returns `frequency_table`, which is a dictionary with each unique number from `arr` as keys and their counts (capped at `k`) as values.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`. It returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each unique number from `arr` is a key, and its value is the count of that number in `arr`, capped at `k`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `frequency_table`, which is a dictionary with each unique number from `arr` as keys and their counts (capped at `k`) as values.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
