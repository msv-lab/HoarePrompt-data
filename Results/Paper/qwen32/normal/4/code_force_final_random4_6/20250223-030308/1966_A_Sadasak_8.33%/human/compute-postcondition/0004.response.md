Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one element; `frequency_table[num]` is set to `k`. The current value of `frequency_table[num]` is `k`.**

Explanation: The value of `frequency_table[num]` is explicitly set to `k`, so it no longer holds its previous value which was greater than `k`. All other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.
