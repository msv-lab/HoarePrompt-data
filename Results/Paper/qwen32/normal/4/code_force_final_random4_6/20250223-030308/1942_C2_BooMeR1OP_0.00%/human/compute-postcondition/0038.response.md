The code snippet `gaps.append(gap)` appends the value of `gap` to the list `gaps`. Therefore, the list `gaps` will now include the value of `gap` as its last element. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is `x - 2 + number_of_times_condition_is_true`, `gaps` is either `[gap]` if it was empty or `[gap1, gap2, ..., gap]` if it contained `[gap1, gap2, ..., gapn]` before, `x` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `next_elem` is `a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`**
