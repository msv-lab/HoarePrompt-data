The code snippet provided recalculates the value of `next_elem` using the given formula. The other variables (`ans`, `gaps`, `x`, `i`, `gap`) remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the new value of `next_elem`, which is not the case here.

Given:
- `next_elem` is initially calculated as `a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)`.
- The code snippet recalculates `next_elem` using the same formula.

Since the formula is the same and no other variables are updated, the value of `next_elem` remains the same as it was initially calculated.

Output State: **`ans` is `x - 2 + number_of_times_condition_is_true`, `gaps` is either an empty list or a list containing `[gap]` if `gap` is greater than 0 or `[gap]` is appended to the existing list, `x` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `next_elem` is `a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`**.
