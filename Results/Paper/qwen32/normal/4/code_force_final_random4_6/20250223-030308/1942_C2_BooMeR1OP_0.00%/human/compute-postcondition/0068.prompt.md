You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, x, and y are integers where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
def func_1():
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [(num - 1) for num in a]
    a.sort()
    present = set(a)
    ans = x - 2
    for i in range(x):
        t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n
        
        t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n
        
        if t1 not in present and t2 in present:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: ans = x - 2 + number_of_times_condition_is_true.
    gaps = []
    for i in range(x):
        next_elem = a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)
        
        gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
        
        if gap > 0:
            gaps.append(gap)
        
    #State: `ans` is `x - 2 + number_of_times_condition_is_true`, `gaps` is a list containing all positive gaps calculated during the loop iterations.
    gaps.sort()
    for gap in gaps:
        pairs = gap // 2
        
        if y >= pairs:
            ans += gap
            y -= pairs
        else:
            ans += 2 * y
            break
        
    #State: `ans` is the initial value plus the sum of all `gap` values for which `y >= pairs`, plus `2 * y` if the loop breaks because `y < pairs`. `y` is `0` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, or the remaining value of `y` when the loop breaks. `gaps` remains unchanged.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the initial value plus the sum of all gap values for which y >= pairs, plus 2 * y if the loop breaks because y < pairs)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, where `n` is the total number of vertices, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and `y` is an integer related to the vertices. It also accepts a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The function returns a result for each test case based on these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
