Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`; `present` is a set containing the unique elements of `a`; `i` is `i + 2`; `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`; `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`. If `t1` is not in `present` and `t2` is in `present`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
