The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and assigns this list to the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
