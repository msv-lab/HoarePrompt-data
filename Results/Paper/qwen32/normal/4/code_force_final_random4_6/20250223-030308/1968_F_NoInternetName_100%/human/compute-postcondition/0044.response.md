Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`; `lower` is `inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]`; `upper` is `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]`.**

Explanation: The value of `upper` is calculated and assigned based on the given expression. The values of `i`, `l`, `r`, and `lower` remain unchanged from the initial state.
