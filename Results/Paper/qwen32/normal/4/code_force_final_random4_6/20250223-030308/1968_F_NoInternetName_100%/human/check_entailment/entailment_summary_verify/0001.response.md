### Reasoning:

Let's verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to determine if a subarray can be split into more than one part such that the bitwise XOR of each part is the same. The program uses prefix XOR values to check if such a division is possible.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the number of queries `q`, the array `a`, and the queries.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR for the array `a` and stores it in the list `x`.
   - It also maintains a dictionary `inds` that maps each prefix XOR value to the indices where this prefix XOR value occurs.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program checks if the subarray `a[l-1:r]` can be split into parts with equal XOR.
   - If `x[l-1] == x[r]`, it means the entire subarray has a XOR of 0, which implies it can be split into any number of parts with XOR 0. Hence, the answer is "Yes".
   - If `x[l-1] != x[r]`, it uses the indices stored in `inds` to find if there exists an index `lower` such that `inds[x[r]]` has an index less than `l` and an index `upper` such that `inds[x[l-1]]` has an index less than or equal to `r`.
   - If `upper > lower`, it means there exists a point in the subarray where the prefix XOR can be split into two parts with the same XOR, hence the answer is "Yes". Otherwise, the answer is "No".

#### Function Summary:
The function `func_5` processes a list of integers `a` of length `n` and a series of `q` queries, each defined by a pair of integers `l` and `r`. For each query, it determines whether there exists a subarray `a[l-1:r]` whose XOR is zero and prints "Yes" if such a subarray exists, otherwise it prints "No".

#### Correctness Verification:
- The program correctly computes the prefix XOR values.
- The use of binary search in `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` ensures that the indices are found efficiently.
- The logic for checking the subarray's XOR properties is correct.
- The program handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

However, there is a subtle issue in the function summary and the logic of the program. The function summary states that the program checks if there exists a subarray `a[l-1:r]` whose XOR is zero. However, the problem statement requires checking if the subarray can be split into more than one part with equal XOR, not necessarily zero.

#### Detailed Analysis:
- **Case 1:** If `x[l-1] == x[r]`, the subarray `a[l-1:r]` has a XOR of zero. This means the subarray can be split into any number of parts with XOR zero, which satisfies the condition.
- **Case 2:** If `x[l-1] != x[r]`, the program checks if there exists a point where the prefix XOR can be split into two parts with the same XOR. This is done by finding indices `lower` and `upper` such that `x[lower] == x[upper]` and `lower < l <= upper <= r`. This ensures that the subarray can be split into two parts with the same XOR, which satisfies the condition.

The logic in the program correctly handles both cases, ensuring that the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR, not necessarily zero.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution based on the problem description and handles all edge cases. The function summary is slightly misleading but does not affect the correctness of the program.

Final: **True**
