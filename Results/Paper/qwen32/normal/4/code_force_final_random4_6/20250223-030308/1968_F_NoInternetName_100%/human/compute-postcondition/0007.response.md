The code appends the index of the last element in the list `x` to the list `inds[0]`. Given that `x` contains elements `[0, i]`, the last element of `x` is `i`, but since `inds[x[-1]]` is used, and `x[-1]` is `i`, the code actually appends the index of `i` in `x` to `inds[i]`. However, since `x[-1]` is `i` and `x` is `[0, i]`, `x[-1]` is the second element, which has an index of `1`. Therefore, `inds[i]` will be updated to include `1`. But since the problem specifies `inds[0]` is `[0]` initially, and the code uses `inds[x[-1]]`, and `x[-1]` is `i`, the correct interpretation here is that `inds[0]` will be updated to include `1` because `x[-1]` is `i` and `i` is the second element in `x` which is at index `1` but the problem specifies `inds[0]` is the only key in `inds` initially. Therefore, the code appends `1` to `inds[0]`.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are new integers returned by `func_1`, `a` is a new list of integers returned by `func_1(int)` and must contain at least one element, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`, `x` is a list containing elements `[0, i]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where `inds[0]` is `[0, 1]`.**
