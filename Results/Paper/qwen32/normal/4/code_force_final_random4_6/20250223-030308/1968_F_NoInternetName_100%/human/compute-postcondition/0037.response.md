Postcondition: **`n` and `q` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `l` and `r` are integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `x` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a unique value in `x` and the value is a list of indices in `x` where that value appears, `q` is greater than 0, `upper` is the index from `inds[x[l - 1]]` that satisfies the condition `arg <= r` as processed by `func_3`, `i` is `i + 1`, `lower` is `inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]`. If `upper > lower`, the state of the variables remains as described. Otherwise, the state of the variables also remains as described.**

In simpler terms: **The variables `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `inds`, `upper`, and `lower` retain their initial states as described in the precondition, regardless of whether `upper > lower` or not. The only change is that `i` is incremented by 1.**
