Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `q` are new integers returned by `func_1`, `a` is a new list of integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`, `x` is a list containing a single element `0`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where `inds[0]` is `[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
    inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `q` are new integers returned by `func_1`, `a` is a new list of integers returned by `func_1(int)` and must contain at least one element, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`, `x` is a list containing elements `[0, i]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where `inds[0]` is `[0, 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `q` are new integers returned by `func_1`; `a` is a new list of integers returned by `func_1(int)` and must contain at least two elements; `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`; `x` is a list containing elements `[0, i, 0]`; `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where `inds[0]` is `[0, 1, 2]`; `i` is the next element in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `q` are new integers returned by `func_1`; `a` is a new list of integers returned by `func_1(int)` and must contain at least two elements; `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`; `x` is a list containing elements `[0, i, 0, i]`; `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where `inds[0]` is `[0, 1, 2]` and `inds[i]` is `[3]`; `i` is the second element in the list `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
