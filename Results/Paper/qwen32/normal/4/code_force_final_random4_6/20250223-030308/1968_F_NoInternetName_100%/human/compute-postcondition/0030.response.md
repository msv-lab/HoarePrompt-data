Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `n` and `q` are integers.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `l` and `r` are integers returned by `func_1(int)`.
   - `x` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point.
   - `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a unique value in `x` and the value is a list of indices in `x` where that value appears.
   - `q` is greater than 0.
   - `lower` is an integer determined by the indices in `inds[x[r]]` and the condition `arg < l`.
   - `upper` is the index from `inds[x[l - 1]]` that satisfies the condition `arg <= r` as processed by `func_3`.
   - If `upper` is greater than `lower`, then `upper` is greater than `lower`. Otherwise, `upper` is not greater than `lower`.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('Yes')`.

### Analysis

The print statement `print('Yes')` directly prints the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of the variables `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `inds`, `lower`, `upper`, and `i`. The condition checks for `upper` being greater than `lower` do not affect the print statement itself, as it only prints the string `'Yes'`.

### Output

Based on the analysis, the print statement will always output the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
