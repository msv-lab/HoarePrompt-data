The given initial state describes the following:
- `i` is being updated to `i + 1`, but the value of `i` before this operation is not specified.
- `l` and `r` are the values returned by the function `func_1(int)`. However, the specific integer passed to `func_1` and the actual values returned by `func_1` are not provided.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('Yes')
```

This `print` statement directly prints the string `'Yes'` and does not depend on the values of `i`, `l`, or `r`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply:
Output: **Yes**
