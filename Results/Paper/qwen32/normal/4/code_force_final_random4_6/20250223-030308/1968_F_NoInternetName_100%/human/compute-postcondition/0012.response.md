The code appends a new element to the list `x` which is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the last element of `x` and the variable `i`. Given that `x` initially contains `[0, i, 0]`, the last element of `x` is `0`. Therefore, the new element appended to `x` will be `0 ^ i`, which is simply `i`.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are new integers returned by `func_1`; `a` is a new list of integers returned by `func_1(int)` and must contain at least two elements; `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`; `x` is a list containing elements `[0, i, 0, i]`; `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where `inds[0]` is `[0, 1, 2]`; `i` is the second element in the list `a`.**
