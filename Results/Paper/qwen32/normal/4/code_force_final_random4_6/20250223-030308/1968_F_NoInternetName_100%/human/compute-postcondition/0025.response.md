Postcondition: **`n` and `q` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`, `x` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a unique value in `x` and the value is a list of indices in `x` where that value appears, `q` is greater than 0, `lower` is an integer determined by the indices in `inds[x[r]]` and the condition `arg < l`, `upper` is the index from `inds[x[l - 1]]` that satisfies the condition `arg <= r` as processed by `func_3`, and `upper` is not greater than `lower`.**
