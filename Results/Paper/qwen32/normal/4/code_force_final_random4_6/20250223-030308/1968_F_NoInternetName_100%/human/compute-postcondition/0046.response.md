The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. The initial state describes several variables and their relationships, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value to be printed is simply the string `'No'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes the following:
   - `i` is set to `i + 1`.
   - `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
   - `lower` is determined based on the result of `func_4` applied to `inds[x[r]]` with a lambda function.
   - `upper` is determined based on the result of `func_3` applied to `inds[x[l - 1]]` with a lambda function.

2. The `print` statement is `print('No')`.

3. The string `'No'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement and does not depend on the values of `i`, `l`, `r`, `lower`, or `upper`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
