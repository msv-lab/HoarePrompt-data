### Reasoning:

The program consists of several functions, and the primary function `func_5` handles the core logic for determining if a subarray is interesting based on the XOR criteria. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - `func_1` is used to read and cast input values to integers. It reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads `n`, `q`, the list of integers `a`, and the `q` queries.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - `x` is a list that stores the prefix XOR values of the array `a`. The prefix XOR at index `i` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i-1`.
   - `inds` is a dictionary that maps each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query defined by `l` and `r`, the program checks if the subarray from `a[l-1]` to `a[r-1]` is interesting.
   - It first checks if the prefix XOR values at `l-1` and `r` are equal. If they are, it means the subarray `a[l-1:r]` has a XOR of zero, and the program prints "Yes".
   - If the prefix XOR values are not equal, the program attempts to find a valid split point within the subarray.
   - It uses `func_4` and `func_3` to find the largest index `lower` in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` and the smallest index `upper` in `inds[x[l-1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
   - If `upper` is greater than `lower`, it means there exists a valid split point, and the program prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

4. **Helper Functions**:
   - `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are used to find specific indices in the `inds` dictionary based on predicates. These functions perform binary search to efficiently find the required indices.

### Evaluation:
- The main logic in `func_5` is correct. It properly calculates the prefix XOR values and uses them to determine if a subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.
- The helper functions (`func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`) are correctly implemented to perform binary search and find the appropriate indices in the `inds` dictionary.
- The program handles all edge cases, including when there are no valid splits or when the prefix XOR values are equal.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the XOR criteria. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
