The code snippet assigns a value to the variable `lower` based on the indices provided by `inds` and the result of `func_4`. Here's the output state after the execution:

- `i` was initially `i + 1`, and its value is unchanged.
- `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, and their values are unchanged.
- `lower` is assigned the value from `inds[x[r]]` at the index determined by `func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0`.

The `func_4` function is used to find the first index in `inds[x[r]]` where the value is less than `l`. If no such index is found, `0` is used as the default index.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`; `lower` is `inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]`.**
