To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, we need to understand the values of `k` and how it is derived from the given initial state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b` remain unchanged.
- `k` is the number of characters in `a` found in `b` in order.
- `j` is the index in `b` where the search stopped.

### Analysis:
The value of `k` is defined as the number of characters in `a` that can be found in `b` in the same order. This means we need to find a subsequence in `b` that matches the sequence of characters in `a`.

However, the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `k`. But we can describe `k` in terms of `a` and `b`.

### Conclusion:
The value of `k` is the length of the longest subsequence of `a` that appears in `b` in the same order.

Output: **k (where k is the number of characters in `a` found in `b` in order)**
