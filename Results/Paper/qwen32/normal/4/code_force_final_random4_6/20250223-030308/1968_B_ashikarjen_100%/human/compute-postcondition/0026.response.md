To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop based on the given information:

- The loop increments `j` by 1 until either `j` reaches `m` or `b[j]` equals `a[i]`.
- After 3 iterations, `j` is 3, `m` must be greater than 2, and `b[2]` is not equal to `a[i]`.

This means that after 3 iterations, the loop hasn't found a match (`b[j] != a[i]`) and `j` is now 3. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `m` and `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`.

There are two possible scenarios:
1. The loop finds a match (`b[j] == a[i]`) at some point before `j` reaches `m`.
2. The loop runs until `j` reaches `m` without finding a match.

Given the information, we can't determine which scenario will occur definitively. However, we can describe the final state for both scenarios:

### Scenario 1: The loop finds a match
- The loop stops when `b[j] == a[i]`.
- The final value of `j` will be the index where the match is found.
- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` will remain unchanged.

### Scenario 2: The loop runs until `j` reaches `m`
- The loop stops when `j` equals `m`.
- `j` will be equal to `m`.
- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` will remain unchanged.

Since we don't have specific information about the contents of `b` and `a`, we'll assume the worst-case scenario where the loop runs until `j` reaches `m`.

Output State: **t remains unchanged, n remains unchanged, m remains unchanged, a remains unchanged, i is incremented by 1, j is equal to m.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop, the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `m` stay the same. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` reaches the value of `m` because no match was found between `b[j]` and `a[i]` within the bounds of `m`.
