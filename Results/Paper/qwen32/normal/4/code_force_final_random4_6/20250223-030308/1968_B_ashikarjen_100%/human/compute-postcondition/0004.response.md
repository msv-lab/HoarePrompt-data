Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are three lines: two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the lengths of binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively. The next line contains the binary string `a` of length `n`. The variable `b` is now assigned the binary string of length `m` for the current test case. `k` is 0. `j` is 0.**

In natural language: The initial conditions remain the same, with `t` representing the number of test cases, `n` and `m` representing the lengths of binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively, and `a` and `b` being the binary strings themselves. The variable `k` is set to 0, and the variable `j` is also set to 0.
