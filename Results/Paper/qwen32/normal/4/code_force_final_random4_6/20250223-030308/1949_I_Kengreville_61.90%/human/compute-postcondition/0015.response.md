Output State: **`i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n; `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers representing the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and radii of the disks respectively; `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited, and now `visited[i]` is True; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`; `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`; `coef0[j]` is `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`; `coef1[j]` is `-coef1[i]`.**

In simple terms, the output state indicates that the variable `coef1[j]` has been updated to be the negative of `coef1[i]`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
