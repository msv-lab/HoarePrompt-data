Output State: **`i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the number of disks; `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers representing the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and radii of the disks respectively; `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited, and the current value of `visited[i]` is True; `nodes` is a list that will store the indices of the disks that are part of the current connected component, and now `nodes` includes `i`; `coef0` and `coef1` are lists used to store coefficients related to the constraints of the problem.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `i` remains unchanged. The lists `x`, `y`, and `r` remain unchanged. The list `visited` remains unchanged except that `visited[i]` is still True. The list `nodes` now includes the index `i`. The lists `coef0` and `coef1` remain unchanged.
