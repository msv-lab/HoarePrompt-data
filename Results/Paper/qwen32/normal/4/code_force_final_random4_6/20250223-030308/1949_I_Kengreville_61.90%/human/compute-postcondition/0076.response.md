The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes various variables and their properties, but none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will simply be the string `'YES'`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `n` is an integer greater than 0.
- `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers with length `n`.
- `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n`.
- `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of integers with length `n` that are updated based on a `dfs` function.
- `nodes` is an empty list.
- `ok` is a boolean value indicating that there was at least one iteration where `c1` was not `0`.

Since the `print` statement is `print('YES')`, it will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables described in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
