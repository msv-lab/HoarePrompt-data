You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, x, y, and r are lists of integers where x[i], y[i] are the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk and r[i] is the radius of the i-th disk, with -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9 for each i in the range [0, n-1]. visited is a list of boolean values initialized to False, coef0 and coef1 are lists of None values initialized to store coefficients for each disk, and nodes is an initially empty list used to store indices of disks during the depth-first search (DFS) process.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef0 = [None] * n
    coef1 = [None] * n
    nodes = []
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is an input integer, `y` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is an input integer, `r` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is an input integer, `visited` is a list of boolean values initialized to `False` with length `n`, `coef0` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `coef1` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `nodes` is an empty list.`
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef0[i] = 0
            coef1[i] = 1
            nodes = []
            dfs(i)
            c0 = 0
            c1 = 0
            for j in nodes:
                c0 += coef0[j]
                c1 += coef1[j]
            ok = ok or c1 != 0
        
    #State: `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` where each element is `True` if it was visited during the loop, `coef0` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is updated based on the `dfs` function if it was not visited before, `coef1` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is updated based on the `dfs` function if it was not visited before, `nodes` is an empty list, `ok` is `True` if there was at least one iteration where `c1` was not `0`.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` where each element is `True` if it was visited during the loop, `coef0` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is updated based on the `dfs` function if it was not visited before, `coef1` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is updated based on the `dfs` function if it was not visited before, `nodes` is an empty list, and `ok` is a boolean value indicating whether there was at least one iteration where `c1` was not `0`. Specifically, if `ok` is `True`, it indicates that there was at least one iteration where `c1` was not `0`; otherwise, `ok` is `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes`. The parameter `n` is an integer representing the number of disks, where 1 <= n <= 1000. The parameters `x` and `y` are lists of integers representing the x and y coordinates of the centers of the disks, respectively. The parameter `r` is a list of integers representing the radii of the disks. The parameter `visited` is a list of boolean values initialized to `False` for each disk. The parameters `coef0` and `coef1` are lists initialized to `None` to store coefficients for each disk. The parameter `nodes` is an initially empty list used to store indices of disks during a depth-first search (DFS) process. The function does not explicitly return a value, but it likely modifies the `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` lists as part of its operations.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
