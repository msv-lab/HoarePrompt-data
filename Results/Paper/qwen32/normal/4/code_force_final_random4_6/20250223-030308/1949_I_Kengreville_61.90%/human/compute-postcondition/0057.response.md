Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n`, `coef0` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef0[2]` is `0`, `coef1` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef1[2]` is `1`, `nodes` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `c0` is `0`, `c1` is `1`, and `ok` is `True`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `coef1[i] = 1` sets the value of `coef1[2]` to `1` because `i` is `2`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
