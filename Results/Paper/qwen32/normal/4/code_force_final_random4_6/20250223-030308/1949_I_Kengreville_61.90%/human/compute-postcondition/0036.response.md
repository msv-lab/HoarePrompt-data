The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. The value of `n` remains the same as long as it is greater than 1 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n`, `coef0` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `coef1` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `nodes` is an empty list, `i` is 1. If `visited[i]` is `False`, then `c0` is `sum_coef0`, `c1` is `sum_coef1`, and `ok` is updated to `ok or c1 != 0`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `c0`, `c1`, or `ok`.**
