### Reasoning:

1. **Global Variables in DFS Function**:
   The `dfs` function indeed uses global variables without explicitly declaring them as global, which can lead to undefined behavior. However, this is not the primary issue causing the program to be incorrect. The main issue lies in the logic for determining whether the radii can be adjusted to meet the problem's conditions.

2. **DFS Logic**:
   The DFS logic is intended to identify connected components of disks that are tangent to each other. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the requirement that the sum of all radii strictly decreases. The `coef0` and `coef1` lists are used to track the coefficients of the radii, but the program does not ensure that the new radii will result in a strictly decreasing sum of radii.

3. **Condition for Tangency**:
   The condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` checks for exact tangency, which is appropriate given the problem constraints (integer coordinates and radii). The problem does not specify floating-point arithmetic, so this condition is valid.

4. **Handling of Non-Connected Components**:
   The main function `func_1` correctly identifies connected components using DFS. However, it does not handle the logic to ensure that the sum of radii strictly decreases across all components. The variable `ok` is set to `True` if any component has a non-zero `c1`, but this does not guarantee that the sum of radii will strictly decrease.

5. **Output**:
   The output is based on the variable `ok`, which is set if any component has a non-zero `c1`. However, this condition does not ensure that the sum of radii strictly decreases. The problem requires a more comprehensive approach to check if the radii can be adjusted to meet all the conditions.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
3
0 0 1
2 0 1
4 0 1
```
In this case, the disks are tangent to each other in a line. The current implementation might incorrectly determine that it is possible to adjust the radii to meet the conditions, but in fact, it is not possible to strictly decrease the sum of radii while maintaining tangency.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve:
- Ensuring that the DFS correctly handles the tangency condition with proper precision checks.
- Ensuring that the logic for adjusting radii strictly decreases the sum of radii while maintaining tangency.
- Handling multiple connected components and ensuring the sum of radii decreases across all components.

Given these issues, the current implementation is incorrect. The original assessment is accurate in identifying the primary logical flaw in the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
