Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the number of disks; `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers representing the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and radii of the disks respectively; `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited, and the current value of `visited[i]` is True; `nodes` is a list that will store the indices of the disks that are part of the current connected component, and now `nodes` includes `i`; `coef0` and `coef1` are lists used to store coefficients related to the constraints of the problem.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    dx = x[i] - x[j]
    dy = y[i] - y[j]
    if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
        coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
        coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
        dfs(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n; `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers representing the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and radii of the disks respectively; `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited, and now `visited[i]` is True. If `visited[j]` was False and the disks `i` and `j` are touching (i.e., `(r[i] + r[j])

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n; `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers representing the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and radii of the disks respectively; `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited, and `visited[j]` is True. `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`; `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`. If `visited[j]` is False and `(r[i] + r[j])

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n; `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers representing the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and radii of the disks respectively; `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `dx` is the difference between `x[i]` and `x[j]`; `dy` is the difference between `y[i]` and `y[j]`. If `visited[j]` is False and the sum of the squares of the radii of disks `i` and `j` equals the sum of the squares of `dx` and `dy`, then `coef0[j]` is assigned the value `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, `coef1[j]` is set to `-coef1[i]`, and `dfs(j)` is executed. Otherwise, no changes are made to `coef0[j]`, `coef1[j]`, or `visited[j]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
