The code snippet `todo.remove(a[r])` removes the element at index `r` (which is `m + 2`) from the list `todo`. This means that the element `a[r]` will no longer be in the `todo` list.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
- `n` is an integer greater than `m`
- `k` is the integer provided by the input
- `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input
- `j` is `m-1`
- `r` is `m + 2`
- `old` is `a[2]` and is not in `extra`. If `old` was in `extra`, the state remains unchanged. If `old` was in `done`, it is now removed from `done` and included in `todo`. If the length of `done` is less than `k`, `ans` is 1; otherwise, `ans` is 3. If `old` was not in `done`, `ans` and `todo` remain unchanged.

After executing the code `todo.remove(a[r])`, the element `a[r]` is removed from `todo`. No other variables are mentioned to be affected by this operation, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer greater than `m`, `k` is the integer provided by the input, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `j` is `m-1`, `r` is `m + 2`, `old` is `a[2]` and is not in `extra`. If `old` was in `extra`, the state remains unchanged. If `old` was in `done`, it is now removed from `done` and included in `todo`. If the length of `done` is less than `k`, `ans` is 1; otherwise, `ans` is 3. If `old` was not in `done`, `ans` and `todo` remain unchanged. The element `a[r]` is removed from `todo`.**
