Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `todo` is a set of unique integers obtained from the input; `done` is an empty set; `extra` is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    if a[j] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[j])
        done.add(a[j])
    else:
        extra.add(a[j])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input with `m` greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `todo` is a set of unique integers obtained from the input, except it no longer contains `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`; `done` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` is an empty set; `extra` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was not in `todo`, otherwise `extra` is an empty set.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input with `m` greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `todo` is a set of unique integers obtained from the input, except it no longer contains `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`; `done` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` is an empty set; `extra` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was not in `todo`, otherwise `extra` is an empty set, and now `extra` also contains `a[j]` if `a[j]` was not in `todo`; `j` is incremented by 1. If `a[j]` was in `todo`, it has been removed from `todo` and added to `done`. Otherwise, `a[j]` has been added to `extra`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input with `m` greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `todo` is a set of unique integers obtained from the input, except it no longer contains `a[4]` if `a[4]` was in `todo`; `done` is a set containing `a[4]` if `a[4]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` is an empty set; `extra` is a set containing `a[4]` if `a[4]` was not in `todo`; `j` is 4.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
