The code snippet adds the element `a[r]` to the set `extra`. This action does not change the values of `t`, `m`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `j`, `r`, `old`, `done`, `todo`, or `ans` as they are not directly affected by the operation. The only change is that `extra` now includes `a[r]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer greater than `m`, `k` is the integer provided by the input, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `j` is `m-1`, `r` is `m + 2`, `old` is `a[2]` and is not in `extra`. If `old` was in `extra`, the state remains unchanged. If `old` was in `done`, it is now removed from `done` and included in `todo`. If the length of `done` is less than `k`, `ans` is 1; otherwise, `ans` is 3. If `old` was not in `done`, `ans` and `todo` remain unchanged. `extra` includes `a[r]`.**
