The code snippet `todo.remove(a[j])` removes the element `a[j]` from the set `todo`. Given that `a[j]` is initially in `todo`, after this operation, `a[j]` will no longer be part of `todo`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is the second integer provided by the input and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the first integer provided by the input and is greater than `m`; `k` is the third integer provided by the input; `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the latest input; `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input with `a[j]` removed; `done` is an empty set; `extra` is an empty set; `j` is `m-1`; `ans` is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop.**
