The code snippet `extra.add(a[r])` adds the element at index `r` of the list `a` to the set `extra`. 

Given the initial state, `r` is initially set to `m`, so `a[r]` refers to the element at index `m` in the list `a`.

After executing the code, the set `extra` will include the element `a[m]` in addition to any elements it already contained.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is the integer provided by the input; `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input; `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input, excluding any elements that were in the first `m` elements of `a` and were in `todo`; `extra` is a set containing all elements from the first `m` elements of `a` that were not in `todo`, excluding `old`, and now also contains `a[m]`; `done` is a set of integers that may or may not contain `old`; `j` is `m-1`; `ans` is 1 if len(done) >= k else 0; `r` is `m`; `old` is `a[0]` and is not in `extra`. Additionally, `a[r]` is not in `todo`.**
