### Reasoning:
The provided program is designed to solve the problem by using a sliding window technique. Here's a detailed breakdown of how it works and why it is correct:

1. **Initialization**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the list `a` of `n` integers and the list `b` of `m` integers.
   - The `todo` set is initialized with the elements of `b`. This set keeps track of which elements from `b` we need to find in the current window of `a`.

2. **First Window**:
   - The program processes the first window of size `m` in the list `a`.
   - It iterates through the first `m` elements of `a` and checks if each element is in the `todo` set.
   - If an element is found in `todo`, it is moved to the `done` set, indicating that this element is now accounted for in the current window.
   - If an element is not found in `todo`, it is added to the `extra` set, which holds elements not needed for matching `b`.

3. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program then slides the window one element at a time from the start of the list `a` to the end.
   - For each new position, it removes the element that is no longer in the window (`old`), and adds the new element that has just come into the window (`a[r]`).
   - If `old` was in the `extra` set, it is removed from `extra`.
   - If `old` was in the `done` set, it is removed from `done` and added back to `todo` because it is no longer part of the current window.
   - The new element `a[r]` is processed similarly to the first window: if it is in `todo`, it is moved to `done`; otherwise, it is added to `extra`.
   - After processing each new element, the program checks if the size of the `done` set is at least `k`. If it is, the current window is considered good, and the count `ans` is incremented.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all possible windows, the program outputs the count of good windows for the current test case.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the sliding window technique to efficiently count the number of good subsegments of `a` that match the conditions specified in the problem description. It maintains the necessary sets (`todo`, `done`, `extra`) to track the elements and ensures that the window slides correctly over the list `a`.

Therefore, the program is correct for the given problem.

**Correctness: True**
