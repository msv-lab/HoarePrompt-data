Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `todo` is a set of unique integers obtained from the input, except it no longer contains any elements that were in `a` and also in `todo`; `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo`; `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo`; `j` is `m`.** 

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged.
- The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` remain as they were provided by the input.
- The list `a` remains unchanged.
- The set `todo` will not contain any elements that were both in `a` and `todo` initially.
- The set `done` will contain all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo`.
- The set `extra` will contain all elements from `a` that were not in `todo`.
- The loop variable `j` will be equal to `m`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
