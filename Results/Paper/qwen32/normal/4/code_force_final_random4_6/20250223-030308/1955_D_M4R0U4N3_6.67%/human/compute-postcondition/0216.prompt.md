Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5. a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. b is a list of m integers where each element b_i satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    todo = set(map(int, input().split()))
    done = set()
    extra = set()
    for j in range(m):
        if a[j] in todo:
            todo.remove(a[j])
            done.add(a[j])
        else:
            extra.add(a[j])
    ans = 1 if len(done) >= k else 0
    for r in range(m, n):
        old = a[r - m]
        if old in extra:
            extra.remove(old)
        elif old in done:
            done.remove(old)
            todo.add(old)
        if a[r] in todo:
            todo.remove(a[r])
            done.add(a[r])
        else:
            extra.add(a[r])
        if len(done) >= k:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is any integer; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is an integer provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `todo` is a set of unique integers that were in `todo` initially but have been adjusted based on the last `n - m` elements of `a`; `done` is a set containing all elements from the last `n - m` elements of `a` that were originally in `todo`; `extra` is a set containing all elements from the last `n - m` elements of `a` that were not in `todo`; `j` is `m`; `ans` is the number of times during the loop that the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is the integer provided by the input; `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input; `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input, excluding any elements that were in the sliding window and were in `todo` and then moved to `done` or `extra`; `done` is a set of integers that have been in the sliding window and have been moved from `todo` to `done` at least once; `extra` is a set containing all elements from the sliding window that were not in `todo` initially and have not been moved to `done` or `todo` during the loop; `j` is `m-1`; `ans` is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers; `todo` is a set of unique integers that were not in `done` or `extra` at the end of the loop; `done` is a set containing elements from `a` that were in `todo` at the end of the loop; `extra` is a set containing elements from `a` that were not in `todo` or `done` at the end of the loop; `j` is `m-1`; `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
