The code snippet provided adds the element `a[r]` to the set `extra`. This operation does not affect any other variables' values directly, but it does update the `extra` set by including `a[r]` in it.

Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `m`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `todo`, `done`, `extra`, `j`, `ans`, and `old` remain unchanged except for `extra`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is the second integer provided by the input and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the first integer provided by the input and must be greater than `m`; `k` is the third integer provided by the input; `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the latest input; `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input with `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` removed if they were in `todo`, except `old` is added back to `todo` if `old` was in `done`; `done` is a set containing elements from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `done`; `extra` is a set containing elements from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were not in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `extra`, and now includes `a[r]`; `j` is `m-1`; `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0; `old` is `a[r - m]`. If `old` was in `extra`, it is not in `extra` anymore and is in `todo` if it was in `done`. If `old` was in `done`, it is not in `done` anymore and is in `todo`. Additionally, `a[r]` is not in `todo`.**
