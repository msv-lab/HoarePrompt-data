Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is any integer, `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is an integer provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `todo` is a set of unique integers obtained from the input, except it no longer contains any elements that were in `a` and also in `todo`; `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo`; `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo`; `j` is `m`; `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0; `old` is `a[r - m]` and `old` is in `extra`.**
