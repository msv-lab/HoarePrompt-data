Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is an integer provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input, excluding any elements that were in the first `m` elements of `a` and were in `todo`; `done` is a set containing all elements from the first `m` elements of `a` that were in `todo`; `extra` is a set containing all elements from the first `m` elements of `a` that were not in `todo`; `j` is `m-1`; `ans` is 1 if len(done) >= k else 0; `r` is `m`; `old` is `a[0]`, and `old` is not in `extra`**
