The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a throwaway variable used to iterate over the range of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. Since the loop iterates `t` times, the state needs to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are defined inside the loop and are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
