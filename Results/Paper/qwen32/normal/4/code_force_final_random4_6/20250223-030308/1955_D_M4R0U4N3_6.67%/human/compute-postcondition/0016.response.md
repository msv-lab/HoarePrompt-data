Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input with `m` greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `todo` is a set of unique integers obtained from the input, except it no longer contains `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`; `done` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` is an empty set; `extra` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was not in `todo`, otherwise `extra` is an empty set, and now `extra` also contains `a[j]`; `j` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `a[j]` has been added to the `extra` set. All other variables retain their previous states, except `extra` now includes `a[j]`. The variable `j` has been incremented by 1.
