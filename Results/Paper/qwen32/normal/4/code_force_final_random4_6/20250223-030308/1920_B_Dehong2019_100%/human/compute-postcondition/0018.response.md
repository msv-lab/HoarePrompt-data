Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of the elements in `a` from the `x-th` element to the end of the list plus `a[0]` minus `2 * a[i + x]` if `i + x < n`, otherwise `ans1` remains the sum of the elements in `a` from the `x-th` element to the end of the list plus `a[0]`; `i` is 0; `ans2` is equal to the sum of the elements in `a` from the `x-th` element to the end of the list.**
