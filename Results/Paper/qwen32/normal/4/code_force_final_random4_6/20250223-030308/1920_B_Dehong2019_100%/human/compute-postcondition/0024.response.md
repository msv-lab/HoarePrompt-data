Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order; `i` is 1. If `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is the previous `ans1` plus `a[1]` minus `a[1 + x] * 2` and `ans2` is the maximum of the previous `ans1` and `ans1` plus `a[1]`. Otherwise, `ans1` and `ans2` remain unchanged from their previous values; `ans2` is the maximum of the previous `ans1` and `ans2`.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates `ans2` to be the maximum of its current value and `ans1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. The conditions affecting `ans1` are not altered by this line of code.
