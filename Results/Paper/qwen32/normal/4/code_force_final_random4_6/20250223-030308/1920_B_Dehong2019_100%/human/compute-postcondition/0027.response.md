The code snippet provided is:
```python
ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
```

This line of code subtracts `a[i + x] * 2` from the current value of `ans1`. According to the initial state, `i` is 2, and `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order.

Let's break down the changes:
- `ans1` is updated by subtracting `a[i + x] * 2` from its previous value.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`, and `ans2` remain unchanged.

The output state can be described as follows:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is greater than 0.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order.
- `i` is 2.
- `ans1` is the previous `ans1` minus `a[i + x] * 2`.
- `ans2` is the maximum of the previous `ans1` and `ans2`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order; `i` is 2; `ans1` is the previous `ans1` minus `a[i + x] * 2`; `ans2` is the maximum of the previous `ans1` and `ans2`.**
