Output State: **`t` remains the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are the integers read from the input; `a` is the sorted list of integers in descending order; `i` is `x`; `ans2` is the sum of the list `a` minus `2 * (sum of the first x elements of a)`; `ans1` is the sum of the list `a` minus `2 * (sum of the first x elements of a)`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans2` is updated to be equal to `ans1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
