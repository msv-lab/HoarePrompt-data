The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a conventional way to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. Since the loop variable `_` does not affect the state of the program in any meaningful way, the state of the program at the start of the next iteration of the loop will only involve the loop control variable `_` itself, which is implicitly incremented by 1 with each iteration.

Given that the loop is controlled by the range `n`, we only need to ensure that the loop can execute again by checking if the loop counter has reached `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, the loop counter (which is not explicitly named but is represented by `_`) would have been incremented to a value that is one less than the number of iterations completed.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, the loop counter will be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, `r` is an empty list, `ax` is 1000000007, `a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` equals 1, otherwise `bx` is -1. If `a` equals 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `cx` is a set containing the value `x`.**
