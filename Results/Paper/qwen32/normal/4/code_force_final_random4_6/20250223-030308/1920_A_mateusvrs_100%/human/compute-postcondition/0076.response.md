The value of `ax` is updated to be the minimum of the current value of `x` and the current value of `ax`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than the current value of `_` + 1; `a` and `x` are integers read from the input; `bx`, `ax` is the minimum of the current `x` and the previous `ax`, and `cx` remain unchanged.**
