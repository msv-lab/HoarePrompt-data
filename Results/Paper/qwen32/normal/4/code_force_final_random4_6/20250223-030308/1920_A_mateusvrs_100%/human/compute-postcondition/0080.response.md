To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the effects of the loop on the variables `ax`, `bx`, and `cx`.

1. **ax**: This variable starts at 1000000007 and can only decrease if a constraint of type 2 is encountered (i.e., `a == 2`). The new value of `ax` will be the minimum of its current value and the `x` provided in the constraint.
2. **bx**: This variable starts at -1 and can only increase if a constraint of type 1 is encountered (i.e., `a == 1`). The new value of `bx` will be the maximum of its current value and the `x` provided in the constraint.
3. **cx**: This variable starts as an empty set and will include any `x` values provided in constraints of type 3 (i.e., `a != 1` and `a != 2`).

After all iterations, the final state of these variables will be:
- `ax` will be the smallest value encountered in all constraints of type 2.
- `bx` will be the largest value encountered in all constraints of type 1.
- `cx` will be a set of all unique `x` values encountered in constraints of type 3.

The variable `r` is a list that contains the value `0` or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive). Since `r` is not modified within the loop, it will remain as it was initialized.

**Output State: **`ax` is the smallest value from constraints of type 2, `bx` is the largest value from constraints of type 1, and `cx` is a set of all unique values from constraints of type 3. The list `r` remains unchanged as `[0]` or `[ax - bx + 1 - tmp]` depending on the initial conditions.**

In simpler terms:
- `ax` is the smallest number from type 2 constraints.
- `bx` is the largest number from type 1 constraints.
- `cx` is a set of all unique numbers from type 3 constraints.
- `r` remains as it was initially calculated.
