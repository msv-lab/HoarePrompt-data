The code snippet `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. This means that `cx` will now include `x` in its collection of unique elements.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `a` and `x` are integers read from the input; `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and its previous value if `a` is 1; `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and its original value if `a` is 2; `cx` includes the value of `x` if `a` is neither 1 nor 2; `cx` now includes the value of `x`.**
