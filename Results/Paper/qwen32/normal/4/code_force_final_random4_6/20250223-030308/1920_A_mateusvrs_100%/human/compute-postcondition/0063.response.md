The code snippet `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Since `cx` is a set, it will store unique values. The values of `n`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged except that `cx` now includes `x`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `a` and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is not equal to 1, and `a` is not equal to 2; `cx` includes the value of `x`.**
