Output State: **`r` is a list containing the results of processing each test case as described, with each test case contributing either a 0 (if `bx > ax`) or the count of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` excluding those in `cx` (if `bx <= ax`).**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state is a list `r` that contains the results for each of the `t` test cases. For each test case, the program calculates:
- `ax`: the smallest `x` value from constraints of type 2 (minimum `x` where `a` is 2).
- `bx`: the largest `x` value from constraints of type 1 (maximum `x` where `a` is 1).
- `cx`: a set of all unique `x` values from constraints of type 3.

If `bx` (the maximum value from type 1 constraints) is greater than `ax` (the minimum value from type 2 constraints), the result for that test case is `0` and is appended to the list `r`.

If `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, the program counts how many values in `cx` fall within the range `[bx, ax]` (inclusive) and subtracts this count from `ax - bx + 1`. This result is then appended to the list `r`.

Thus, after all iterations, `r` contains `t` elements, each representing the result of the corresponding test case.
