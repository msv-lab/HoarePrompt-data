The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `n` times. The loop will execute based on the value of `n`. Since `n` is already defined as an input integer such that `2 <= n <= 100`, it ensures that the loop will execute at least twice and at most 100 times. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute.

However, the state description should reflect the given conditions and the fact that the loop will execute based on `n`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, `r` is an empty list, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1**
