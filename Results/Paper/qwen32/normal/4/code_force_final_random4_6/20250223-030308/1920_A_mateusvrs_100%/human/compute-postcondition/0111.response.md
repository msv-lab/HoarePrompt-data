The code snippet `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Given that `cx` was initially an empty set, after this operation, `cx` will contain the value `x`.

The values of other variables (`ax`, `bx`, `r`, `n`, `a`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the operation.

Output State: **`ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is a set containing `x`, `r` is either `[0, 0]` or `[1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp, 0]` or `[0, 1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp]` or `[1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp, 1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp]` depending on the conditions, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, `a` is not equal to 1, and `a` is not equal to 2.**
