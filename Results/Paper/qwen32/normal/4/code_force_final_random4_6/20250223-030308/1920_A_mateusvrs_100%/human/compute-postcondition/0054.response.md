Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is the input integer, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is an empty set, and `r` is a list containing the value 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The value of `bx` has been changed from its previous value (which could have been anything) to -1. All other variables remain unchanged.
