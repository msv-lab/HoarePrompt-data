The code snippet provided only includes the line `n = int(input())`, which means it reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. None of the other variables (`t`, `ax`, `bx`, `cx`, `r`, `tmp`) are affected by this line of code. 

Given that `n` was initially described as an input integer such that `2 <= n <= 100`, the value of `n` will be updated to whatever integer is provided through the input, but the constraints on `n` remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is the input integer, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was 1, and `cx` is a set of all `x` values encountered when `a` was neither 1 nor 2. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, `r` is a list containing the value 0. Otherwise, `r` is a list containing the single element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive)**.
