The code appends `0` to the list `r`. The initial state of `r` can be either `[0]` or `[ax - bx + 1 - tmp]`. After appending `0`, if `r` was initially `[0]`, it becomes `[0, 0]`. If `r` was initially `[ax - bx + 1 - tmp]`, it becomes `[ax - bx + 1 - tmp, 0]`. The values of `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`bx` is greater than `ax`. `ax` is the smallest value from constraints of type 2, `bx` is the largest value from constraints of type 1, and `cx` is a set of all unique values from constraints of type 3. The list `r` is either `[0, 0]` or `[ax - bx + 1 - tmp, 0]`.**
