Postcondition: **`ax` is the smallest value from constraints of type 2, `bx` is the largest value from constraints of type 1, `cx` is a set of all unique values from constraints of type 3 and must contain at least one element, `r` remains unchanged as `[0]` or `[ax - bx + 1 - tmp]` depending on the initial conditions, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`. `i` is `next_i`, which is the next element from `cx`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and `i` is less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is set to 3 (incremented by 1 from 2). Otherwise, `tmp` remains 2 (incremented by 1 from 1).**
