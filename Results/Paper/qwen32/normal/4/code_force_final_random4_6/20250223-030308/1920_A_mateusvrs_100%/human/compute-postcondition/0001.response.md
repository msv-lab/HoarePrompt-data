Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. Each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case. No two constraints are the same (all pairs (a, x) are distinct). `r` is an empty list.**

The variable `r` has been initialized as an empty list, while all other variables and their constraints remain unchanged.
