Postcondition: **`ax` is the smallest value from constraints of type 2, `bx` is the largest value from constraints of type 1, and `cx` is a set of all unique values from constraints of type 3. The list `r` remains unchanged as `[0]` or `[ax - bx + 1 - tmp]` depending on the initial conditions. Additionally, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`.**
