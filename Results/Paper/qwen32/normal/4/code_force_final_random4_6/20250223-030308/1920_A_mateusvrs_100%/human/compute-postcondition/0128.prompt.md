Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is an empty set, `r` is either `[0, 0]` or `[1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp, 0]` or `[0, 1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp]` or `[1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp, 1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp]` depending on the conditions, `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    a, x = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 1:
        bx = max(x, bx)
    elif a == 2:
        ax = min(x, ax)
    else:
        cx.add(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not equal to 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and `x`. `bx` is the maximum of the second integer input `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1. `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `x`. `r` is either `[0, 0]` or `[1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp, 0]` or `[0, 1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp]` or `[1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp, 1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp]` depending on the conditions. `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the first integer input, and `x` is the second integer input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not equal to 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and `x`. `bx` is `max(x, -1)` if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1. `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `x`. `r` is either `[0, 0]` or `[1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp, 0]` or `[0, 1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp]` or `[1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp, 1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp]` depending on the conditions. `n` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not equal to 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and `x`. `bx` is `max(x, -1)` if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1. `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `x`. `r` is either `[0, 0]` or `[1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp, 0]` or `[0, 1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp]` or `[1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp, 1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp]` depending on the conditions. `n` is greater than 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
