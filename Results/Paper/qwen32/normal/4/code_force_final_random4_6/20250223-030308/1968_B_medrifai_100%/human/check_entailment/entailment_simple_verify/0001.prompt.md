You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the maximum prefix length \( k \) of string \( a \) such that this prefix is a subsequence of string \( b \).

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution employs a two-pointer technique to solve the problem. Let's go through the steps:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `i` is a pointer for string `a`, starting at 0.
   - `j` is a pointer for string `b`, starting at 0.
   - `c` counts the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as neither `i` nor `j` has reached the end of their respective strings (`i < n` and `j < m`).
   - For each iteration, the function `func_1(a, b, i, j)` is called to find the next occurrence of `a[i]` in `b[j:]`.
   - If `func_1` returns a valid index (`new_j != -1`), it means `a[i]` was found in `b[j:]` at position `new_j`:
     - `j` is updated to `new_j + 1` (move `j` past the found character).
     - `i` is incremented to check the next character in `a`.
     - `c` is incremented to reflect the length of the matching prefix.
   - If `func_1` returns `-1`, it means `a[i]` is not found in `b[j:]`, and the loop breaks.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function searches for the first occurrence of `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]` using the `find` method.
   - If found, it returns the index relative to `b` (i.e., `j + index`).
   - If not found, it returns `-1`.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Logic**: The logic of using two pointers and the `find` method is correct for finding the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
- **Efficiency**: The use of `find` in each iteration ensures that we efficiently locate the next occurrence of `a[i]` in `b[j:]`.
- **Edge Cases**: The solution handles edge cases such as:
  - When `a` is entirely a subsequence of `b`.
  - When `a` has no common characters with `b`.
  - When `b` is shorter than `a`.

### Conclusion:
Given the correct logic, efficient implementation, and handling of edge cases, the provided solution is correct.

Correctness: **True**
