The code snippet `b[x] += 1` increments the value at index `x` in the list `b` by 1. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `s` is the list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element.
- `r` is the string `a[x]`.
- `b` is a list with values incremented based on the occurrences of each element in `s`.
- `x` is the index of `i` in `b`.

After executing `b[x] += 1`, the value at index `x` in `b` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `s` is the list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `r` is the string `a[x]`; `b` is a list with the value at index `x` incremented by 1; `x` is the index of `i` in `b`.**
