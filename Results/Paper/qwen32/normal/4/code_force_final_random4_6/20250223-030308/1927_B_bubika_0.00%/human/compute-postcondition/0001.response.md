The code initializes a list `b` with 26 zeros. The values of `t`, `n`, and the list `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the original list `a` of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n is not modified; `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `b` is a list of 26 zeros.**
