### Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by checking whether there exists a pair of friends such that they are each other's best friend (i.e., `p[p[i] - 1] == i + 1`). If such a pair is found, it outputs `2` because Monocarp only needs to invite these two friends. If no such pair exists, it outputs `3`, implying that Monocarp needs to invite at least three friends to ensure that at least two of them and their best friends come to the party.

However, the logic of the program is flawed. The program only checks for one specific condition (a pair of mutual best friends) and does not account for other possible configurations that could allow Monocarp to invite fewer than three friends. For example, if there is a cycle of three friends where each friend is the best friend of the next, Monocarp could invite two friends from this cycle, and all three would come to the party. The program should consider such cases to determine the minimum number of invitations correctly.
