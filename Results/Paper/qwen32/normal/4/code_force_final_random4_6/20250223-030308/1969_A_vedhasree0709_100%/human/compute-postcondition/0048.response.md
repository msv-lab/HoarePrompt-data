The `while` loop in question is:

```python
while i <= n - 1:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that the condition `i <= n - 1` holds true.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000
- `n` is at least 1
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `i` is 1
- `p` is `l[0]`
- `q` is `l[l[0] - 1]`
- `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `q` equals `i + 1` or not

Since the only variable in the loop head is `i`, we need to ensure that `i` is adjusted so that `i <= n - 1` remains true. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 2 (so that `n - 1` is at least 1, and `i <= n - 1` holds true).

No other states need to be adjusted since they are not part of the loop head condition.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is at least 2; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 1; `p` is `l[0]`; `q` is `l[l[0] - 1]`; `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `q` equals `i + 1` or not**
