To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `i <= n - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 4999
- `n` is the newly input integer
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 0

The condition `i <= n - 1` needs to be satisfied for the loop to execute. Currently, `i` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0, which means `n` must be at least 1.

Since `t` and `j` are not part of the loop condition, they do not need to be adjusted. The list `l` also does not affect the loop condition directly, so it does not need to be adjusted either.

Thus, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure that `n` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 4999; `n` must be at least 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 0; `j` is 0**
