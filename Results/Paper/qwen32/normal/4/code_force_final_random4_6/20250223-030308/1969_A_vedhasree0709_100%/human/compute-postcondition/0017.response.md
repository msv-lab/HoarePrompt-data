Let's break down the given code and initial state step by step to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `i` is set to 1.
   - `p` is set to the value of `l[1]`.
   - `q` is set to the value of `l[p - 1]`.
   - If `q` equals `i + 1`, then `j` is set to 1. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.

2. **Python Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(2)
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `print(2)` statement directly prints the integer `2`.
   - The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `p`, `q`, and `j` are not used in the print statement.
   - Therefore, regardless of the values of these variables, the print statement will always output `2`.

4. **Output**:
   The code will print the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
