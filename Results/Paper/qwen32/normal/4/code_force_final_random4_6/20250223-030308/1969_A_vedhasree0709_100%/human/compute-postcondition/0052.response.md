Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is at least 2; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 1; `p` is `l[1]`; `q` is `l[l[1] - 1]`; `j` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been explicitly set to 1, while all other variables retain their initial values.
