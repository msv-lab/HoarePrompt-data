The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and then assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `l`. This operation does not affect the variables `t`, `n`, `i`, or `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 4999; `n` is the newly input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is the initial value of `n`; `j` is 0, indicating that the loop did not break out early.**
