Let's analyze the given code and initial state step-by-step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 4999.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `i` is set to 1.
   - `j` is set to 1 if `q` is equal to `i + 1`, otherwise `j` remains 0.
   - `p` is the element at index `i` in `l`.
   - `q` is the element at index `p - 1` in `l`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(2)
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `print` statement is straightforward and prints the integer `2`.
   - The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `j`, `p`, and `q` are defined but not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their specific values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

4. **Output**:
   - The `print` statement will output the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
