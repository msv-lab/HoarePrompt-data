Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
2. `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1.
3. `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
4. `i` is initialized to 0.
5. `j` is initialized to 0.
6. `p` is set to `l[0]` (the first element of list `l`).
7. `q` is set to `l[l[0] - 1]` (the element at the index `l[0] - 1` in list `l`).
8. `q` is then set to `i + 1` (which is 1 since `i` is 0).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is `print(2)`. This statement directly prints the integer value `2` to the console.

### Output:
Since the `print` statement is explicitly printing the integer `2`, the output will be:

Output: **2**
