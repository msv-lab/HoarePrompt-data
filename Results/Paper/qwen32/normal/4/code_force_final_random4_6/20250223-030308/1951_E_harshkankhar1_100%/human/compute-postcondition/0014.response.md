The code snippet `x = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `x`. Given the initial state, `i` is incremented by 1 before this assignment, so `x` will now hold the value of the incremented `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a user input string with at least 2 characters, `n` is the length of `s` (which must be greater than 1), `x` is the value of the incremented `i`, `func_1(s[0:])` returns True, `i` is incremented by 1.**
