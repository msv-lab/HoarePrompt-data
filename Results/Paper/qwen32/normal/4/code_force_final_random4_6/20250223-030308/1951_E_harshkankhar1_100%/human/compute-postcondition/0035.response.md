The provided `print` statement is:

```python
print(2)
```

This statement will print the integer `2` regardless of the initial state or any conditions described in the problem. The initial state provides information about the variable `x` and the behavior of the function `func_1(s[x + 1:])`, but these details do not affect the execution of the `print(2)` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
