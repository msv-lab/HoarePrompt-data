You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
We need to partition a string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. If such a partition is possible, we should output "YES", followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves. If no such partition exists, we should output "NO".

### Program Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(s)`:**
   - This function checks if the string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
   - It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.

2. **Function `func_2()`:**
   - This function handles the input and logic for determining if a valid partition exists.
   - It reads a string `s` and calculates its length `n`.
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`. If `s` is not a palindrome, it outputs "YES", the number of parts (which is 1), and the string itself.
   - If the entire string `s` is a palindrome, it searches for the first character that differs from the first character (`s[0]`). This is done in a loop that iterates through the string.
     - If no such character is found (`x` remains `-1`), it means the string consists of the same character repeated, and thus, no valid partition can be made, so it outputs "NO".
     - If such a character is found, it checks if the substring from this character to the end (`s[x + 1:]`) is not a palindrome.
       - If it is not a palindrome, it outputs "YES", the number of parts (which is 2), and the two parts: the substring from the start to the found character inclusive, and the substring from the character after the found character to the end.
       - If the substring from the found character to the end is a palindrome, it further checks if the found character is at position 1 or at the middle of the string.
         - If either condition is true, it outputs "NO" because no valid partition can be made.
         - Otherwise, it outputs "YES", the number of parts (which is 2), and the two parts: the substring from the start to the character after the found character inclusive, and the substring from the character after the found character to the end.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the case where the entire string is not a palindrome by outputting "YES" with the entire string as the single part.
- The program correctly identifies strings consisting of the same character repeated and outputs "NO" for these cases.
- However, the program does not correctly handle all cases where a valid partition exists. Specifically, the logic for partitioning the string when the entire string is a palindrome is not comprehensive. For example, in the third test case of the example, the string "uwuowouwu" is partitioned into "uw", "uow", and "ouwu", but the program might not handle this correctly based on the current logic.
- The program does not consider all possible ways to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings, especially when the string is longer and more complex.

### Conclusion:
The program is not guaranteed to work for all possible inputs as it does not cover all cases where a valid partition exists, particularly for more complex strings.
