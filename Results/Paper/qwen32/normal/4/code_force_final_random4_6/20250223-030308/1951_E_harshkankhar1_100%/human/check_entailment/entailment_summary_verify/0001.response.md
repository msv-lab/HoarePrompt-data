### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and its behavior based on the problem description and the function summaries provided.

#### Problem Recap:
The task is to partition a string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. If such a partition exists, output "YES", followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves. If no such partition exists, output "NO".

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - This function correctly checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
   - It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads a string `s` and calculates its length `n`.
   - **Initial Check**: It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`. If `s` is not a palindrome, it outputs "YES", followed by the number of parts (which is 1), and the string itself.
   - **Finding the First Different Character**:
     - If the entire string is a palindrome, the function searches for the first character that differs from the first character (`s[0]`). This is done in a loop that iterates through the string.
     - If no such character is found (`x` remains `-1`), it means the string consists of the same character repeated, and thus, no valid partition can be made, so it outputs "NO".
     - If such a character is found, it checks if the substring from this character to the end (`s[x + 1:]`) is not a palindrome.
       - If it is not a palindrome, it outputs "YES", the number of parts (which is 2), and the two parts: the substring from the start to the found character inclusive, and the substring from the character after the found character to the end.
       - If the substring from the found character to the end is a palindrome, it further checks if the found character is at position 1 or at the middle of the string.
         - If either condition is true, it outputs "NO" because no valid partition can be made.
         - Otherwise, it outputs "YES", the number of parts (which is 2), and the two parts: the substring from the start to the character after the found character inclusive, and the substring from the character after the found character to the end.

#### Correctness Analysis:
- **Handling Non-Palindromic Strings**: The function correctly identifies and handles strings that are not palindromes by outputting "YES" with the entire string as the single part.
- **Handling Strings with Repeated Characters**: The function correctly identifies strings consisting of the same character repeated and outputs "NO" for these cases.
- **Handling Palindromic Strings with Different Characters**:
  - The function attempts to find the first character that differs from the first character and checks if the substring from this character to the end is not a palindrome.
  - If the substring from the found character to the end is not a palindrome, it outputs "YES" with two parts.
  - However, the function does not account for more complex partitions. For example, in the third test case of the example, the string "uwuowouwu" is partitioned into "uw", "uow", and "ouwu". The function might not handle this correctly because it only considers partitions into two parts.
  - The function incorrectly assumes that if the substring from the found character to the end is a palindrome and the found character is not at position 1 or the middle, a valid partition can be made. This is not always true.

### Conclusion:
The program does not cover all possible ways to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings, especially for more complex strings. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to work for all possible inputs.

**Final: False**
