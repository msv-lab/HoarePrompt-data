Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Breakdown
The task is to partition a given string into substrings such that no substring is a palindrome. If such a partition exists, the program should output "YES", the number of substrings, and the substrings themselves. If no such partition exists, it should output "NO".

### Program Analysis

#### Function `func_1(s) -> bool`
This function checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing the string to its reverse (`s[::-1]`). If they are the same, the string is a palindrome; otherwise, it is not.

#### Function `func_2()`
This function reads a string `s` from input and attempts to partition it according to the problem's requirements.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial Check for Non-Palindrome**
   The function first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`. If it is not a palindrome, the function immediately outputs "YES", the number of parts (1), and the string itself as the only part. This is correct because if the entire string is not a palindrome, it can be considered as a valid partition of one part.

2. **Finding a Different Character**
   If the entire string is a palindrome, the function then searches for the first character in the string that is different from the first character (`s[0]`). This is done in the loop:
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n):
       if s[i] != s[0]:
           x = i
           break
   ```
   If no such character is found (`x == -1`), the function outputs "NO" because it means the entire string consists of the same character, and thus any partition will result in palindromic substrings.

3. **Checking Remaining Substring**
   If a different character is found, the function checks if the substring starting from this character to the end (`s[x + 1:]`) is not a palindrome. If it is not a palindrome, the function outputs "YES", the number of parts (2), and the two substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`. This is correct because these two substrings will not be palindromes if the second substring is not a palindrome.

4. **Handling Special Cases**
   If the substring `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, the function then checks if `x` is 1 or `x` is `n // 2` (halfway through the string). If either condition is true, it outputs "NO". This is incorrect because it does not consider other possible partitions. For example, if `x` is 1, it does not mean that no valid partition exists; there could be other valid partitions that the function does not consider.

5. **Final Partition**
   If `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`, the function outputs "YES", the number of parts (2), and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`. This is incorrect because it does not guarantee that these substrings are not palindromes. For example, if `s` is "abaca", the function might partition it into "aba" and "ca", but "aba" is a palindrome.

### Conclusion
The program does not handle all cases correctly, especially when the string can be partitioned into more than two parts or when the second substring is a palindrome. Therefore, the program is not correct for all possible inputs.

**Correctness: False**
