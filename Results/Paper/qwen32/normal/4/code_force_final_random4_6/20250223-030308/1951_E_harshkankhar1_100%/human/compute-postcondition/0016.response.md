Postcondition: **`s` is a user input string with at least 2 characters, `n` is the length of `s` (which must be greater than 1), `func_1(s[0:])` returns True, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[0]`, `x` is set to the value of the incremented `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` remains -1.**
