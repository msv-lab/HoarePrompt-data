You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, n is the length of the string s, and x is an integer used as an index to identify a point in the string s where the character differs from the first character of s.
def func_2():
    s = input()
    n, x = len(s), -1
    if (func_1(s[0:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(s)
        #This is printed: s (where s is the user input string)
        return
        #The program does not return any value.
    #State: `s` is the user input string, `n` is the length of the user input string, `x` is -1, and `func_1(s[0:])` returns True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: x is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `s[0]`, or -1 if no such character exists.
    if (x == -1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `s[0]`, and `x` is not equal to -1.
    if (func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
        #This is printed: s[:x + 1]  s[x + 1:] (where s[:x + 1] is the substring from the start of s up to and including the first character that is not equal to s[0], and s[x + 1:] is the substring from the character after the first character that is not equal to s[0] to the end of s)
    else :
        if (x == 1 or x == n // 2) :
            print('NO')
            #This is printed: NO
        else :
            print('YES')
            #This is printed: YES
            print(2)
            #This is printed: 2
            print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
            #This is printed: `s[:x + 2]` (which includes `s[0]`, the first character not equal to `s[0]`, and the character immediately following it), a space, and `s[x + 2:]` (the rest of the string starting from the character two positions after the first differing character)
        #State: `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `s[0]`, and `x` is not equal to -1. Additionally, `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`. The current value of `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, or `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`.
    #State: `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `s[0]`, and `x` is not equal to -1. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` evaluates to `False`, then `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `False`. Otherwise, `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`, and `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, or `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters, an integer `n` representing the length of the string `s`, and an integer `x` used as an index to identify a point in the string `s` where the character differs from the first character of `s`. The function does not return any value in Case_1, and in Case_2, it returns `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program does not return any value.

Case_2: The program returns None
