Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to correctly handle cases where the string can be partitioned into more than two non-palindrome substrings.

Let's analyze the code and identify the issue:

1. **Function `func_1(s)`:** This function correctly checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`s[::-1]`).

2. **Function `func_2()`:** This function reads a string `s` and attempts to determine if it can be partitioned into substrings that are not palindromes. It first checks if the entire string is not a palindrome. If it isn't, it prints "YES" and the string itself as the partition. This part is correct.

3. **Handling Palindromic Strings:** If the entire string is a palindrome, it searches for the first character that differs from the first character of the string. If such a character is found, it checks if the substring starting from this character to the end is not a palindrome. If it isn't, it prints "YES" with a partition of two substrings. This part is also correct for some cases.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:** However, the code does not correctly handle cases where the string can be partitioned into more than two non-palindrome substrings. For example, consider the string "aaaaa". The current code will print "NO" because it cannot find a valid partition of two substrings that are not palindromes. However, a valid partition would be ["aa", "aa", "a"] or ["a", "aaa", "a"], both of which are valid partitions into non-palindrome substrings.

### Counterexample:

Consider the input string "aaaaa":

- The entire string is a palindrome.
- The code searches for the first character that differs from the first character, but since all characters are the same, it fails to find such a character.
- As a result, it prints "NO", which is incorrect because the string can be partitioned into ["aa", "aa", "a"] or other valid partitions.

### Conclusion:

The code does not handle all potential cases correctly, particularly when the string can be partitioned into more than two non-palindrome substrings. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
