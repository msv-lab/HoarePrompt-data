To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `s[0]`. This means `s[0]` is the first character of the string `s`, and `x` points to the first character after `s[0]` that differs from `s[0]`.
   - `x` is not equal to -1, so there is at least one character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`.
   - `func_1(s[x + 1:])` evaluates to `False`. This means the substring starting from the character after the first differing character (i.e., `s[x + 1:]`) causes `func_1` to return `False`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
   ```
   - `s[:x + 1]` will print the substring of `s` from the start up to and including the character at index `x`.
   - `s[x + 1:]` will print the substring of `s` from the character after `x` to the end of the string.

3. **Output Explanation:**
   - `s[:x + 1]` will include the initial character `s[0]` and all subsequent characters up to and including the first character that is not equal to `s[0]`.
   - `s[x + 1:]` will include all characters after the first character that is not equal to `s[0]`.

Given these points, the output will be:
- The first part of the string up to and including the first character that is not equal to `s[0]`.
- A space character.
- The rest of the string starting from the character after the first character that is not equal to `s[0]`.

Since the exact string `s` is not provided, we can't give the exact printed output, but we can describe it precisely based on the given conditions.

Output: **s[:x + 1]  s[x + 1:] (where s[:x + 1] is the substring from the start of s up to and including the first character that is not equal to s[0], and s[x + 1:] is the substring from the character after the first character that is not equal to s[0] to the end of s)**
