Output State: **`s` is a user input string with at least 2 characters, `n` is the length of `s` (which must be greater than 1), `i` is 4, `x` is 4 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the values of `s`, `n`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged, but the program execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
