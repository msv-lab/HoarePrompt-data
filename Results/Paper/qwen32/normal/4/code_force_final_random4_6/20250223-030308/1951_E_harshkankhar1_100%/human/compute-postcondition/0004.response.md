Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `s` is a string input by the user.
- `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- `x` is initialized to -1.
- `func_1(s[0:])` evaluates to `False`.

### Code to Execute:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(1)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `s`, `n`, `x`, or the result of `func_1(s[0:])`. The statement simply prints the integer `1`.

### Output:
Since the `print(1)` statement is independent of the other variables and conditions, it will output the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
