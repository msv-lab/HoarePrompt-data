Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer representing the size of an n x n grid (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10). The grid is composed of n lines, each containing n characters that are either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one shape, which is either a triangle or a square, composed of all the '1's in the grid. The size of the shape (k) is greater than 1. The function returns "triangle" if the shape is a triangle and "square" if the shape is a square.**
