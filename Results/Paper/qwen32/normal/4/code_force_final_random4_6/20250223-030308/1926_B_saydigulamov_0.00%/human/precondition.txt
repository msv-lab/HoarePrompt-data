grid is a list of lists of characters ('0' or '1'), where each inner list represents a row of the grid and all inner lists are of the same length n (2 <= n <= 10). The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square composed of '1's, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.
