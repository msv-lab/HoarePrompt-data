The code snippet `k.append(b.count('1'))` appends the count of the character '1' in the string `b` to the list `k`. 

Given the initial state:
- `a` remains the initial input value.
- `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in `b` if `b` contains the character '1', otherwise `k` is an empty list.
- `i` is equal to `a + 1`.
- `b` is the new string provided by the user input.

After executing the code, `k` will have an additional element, which is the count of '1' in the newly provided string `b`.

Output State: **`a` remains the initial input value; `k` is a list with the previous counts of '1' in `b` plus the new count of '1' in the newly provided `b`; `i` is equal to `a + 1`; `b` is the new string provided by the user input.**
