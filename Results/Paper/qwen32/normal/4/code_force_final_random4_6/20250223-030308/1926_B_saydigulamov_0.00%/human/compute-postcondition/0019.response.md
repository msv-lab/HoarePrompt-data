Postcondition: **`a` is assigned the value of the first integer input, representing the size of the n x n grid, and `a` must be greater than 0; `k` is a list containing the counts of '1's from all the input strings `b` that contain at least one '1'. If the current value of `k[0]` is equal to the current value of `k[1]`, then no change is made to `a` or `k`. Otherwise, no change is made to `a` or `k`.**
