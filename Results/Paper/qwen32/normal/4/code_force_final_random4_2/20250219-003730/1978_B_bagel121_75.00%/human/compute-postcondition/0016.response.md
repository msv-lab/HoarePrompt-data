The code snippet assigns a new value to `p2` based on the expression `(n - k) * a`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `a` are used to compute this new value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers as read from the input; `k` is `min(b - a + 1, n)`; `ans` is `int((2*b - k + 1) / 2 * k)`; `p2` is `(n - k) * a`**.
