Output State: **`t` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.**

In simple terms, `t` remains unchanged from its previous iteration value (which has increased by 1), `n`, `a`, and `b` retain their input values, and `k` is calculated as the smaller of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
