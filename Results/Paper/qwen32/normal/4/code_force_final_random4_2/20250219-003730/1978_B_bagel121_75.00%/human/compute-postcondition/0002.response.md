The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The initial state only specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000, inclusive. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not specified before the execution of this code, so they are assigned based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers as read from the input.**
