Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers as read from the input. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, then no additional changes are made to `a`, `b`, `n`, or `t`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `b`; `k` is the smaller of `b - a + 1` and `n`; `ans` is the integer value of the sum of the `k` largest elements from the range `[a, b]`; and `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.**
