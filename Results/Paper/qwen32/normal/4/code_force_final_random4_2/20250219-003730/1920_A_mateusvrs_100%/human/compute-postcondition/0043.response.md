Postcondition: **`t`, `bx`, and `ax` are as described in the precondition; `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`; `tmp` is 2 if `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `tmp` is 1; `cx` must be an iterable with at least two elements; `i` is the second element of `cx`.**
