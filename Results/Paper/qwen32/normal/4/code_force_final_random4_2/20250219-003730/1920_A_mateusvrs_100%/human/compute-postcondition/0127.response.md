Postcondition: **`t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 2, `r` is a list with `n` additional elements appended to it, `n` is now `n+1`, `ax` is 1000000007, `a` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and its previous value, or -1 if `bx` was not previously defined. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. Otherwise, `cx` is a set containing the element `x` and possibly other elements, including `x`.**
