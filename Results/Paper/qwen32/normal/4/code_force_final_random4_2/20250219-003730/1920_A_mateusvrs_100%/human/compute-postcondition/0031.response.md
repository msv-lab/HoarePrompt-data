Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, and `ax` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `x`. If `a` is not equal to 1 or 2, `cx` is a set containing `x`.**
