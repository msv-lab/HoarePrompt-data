Output State: **`t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 1, `r` is a list with `n` additional elements appended to it, `n` is the input integer, `cx` is a set containing at least one unique `x` value, `ax` is the minimum value of `x` encountered when `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum value of `x` encountered when `a` was 1, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is 1, and `i` is a value such that `bx` is less than or equal to `i` and `i` is less than or equal to `ax`.**

In simple terms, the value of `tmp` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
