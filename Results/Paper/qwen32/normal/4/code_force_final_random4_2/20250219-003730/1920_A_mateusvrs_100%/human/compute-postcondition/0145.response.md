Postcondition: **`t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 2, `r` is a list, `n` is 0, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` where `a` is 1, and `cx` is a set containing all `x` where `a` is neither 1 nor 2. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, `r` includes an additional element `0`. If `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `r` contains one element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the number of elements in `cx` that satisfy `bx <= i <= ax`.**
