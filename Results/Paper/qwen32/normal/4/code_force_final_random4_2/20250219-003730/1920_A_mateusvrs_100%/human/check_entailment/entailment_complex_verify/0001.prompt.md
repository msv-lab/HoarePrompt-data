You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of constraints. Following this, there are n lines, each containing two integers a (a ∈ {1, 2, 3}) and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). If a=1, k must be greater than or equal to x. If a=2, k must be less than or equal to x.

    #State: `t` is 0, `r` is a list containing the results of all test cases.

    #This is printed: Each element of the list `r` printed on a new line (where `r` is a list containing the results of all test cases)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of constraints that define valid ranges for an integer `k`. For each test case, it determines the number of integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints and outputs this count. If no such integer exists, it outputs 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Constraints Types**:
   - Type 1: k ≥ x
   - Type 2: k ≤ x
   - Type 3: k ≠ x

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine the number of integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints.

3. **Approach**:
   - For each test case, read the number of constraints `n`.
   - Process each constraint to determine the minimum (`bx`) and maximum (`ax`) possible values for `k` based on constraints of type 1 and 2.
   - Collect all values that `k` cannot be (`cx`) from constraints of type 3.
   - Calculate the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the count of invalid integers `k` (those in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`) from the total possible integers in the range `[bx, ax]`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `cx`: A set to store values that `k` cannot be (from constraints of type 3).
   - `ax`: Initialized to a large value (`1000000000 + 7`), representing the initial maximum possible value for `k`.
   - `bx`: Initialized to a small value (`-1`), representing the initial minimum possible value for `k`.

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint:
     - If it's of type 1, update `bx` to be the maximum of its current value and the given `x`.
     - If it's of type 2, update `ax` to be the minimum of its current value and the given `x`.
     - If it's of type 3, add `x` to the set `cx`.

3. **Counting Valid `k` Values**:
   - If `bx` is greater than `ax`, it means no valid `k` exists, so append `0` to the results.
   - Otherwise, count how many values in `cx` fall within the range `[bx, ax]` and subtract this count from the total possible integers in the range (`ax - bx + 1`).

4. **Output**:
   - Print the results for all test cases.

### Verification:
- The program correctly handles the constraints and calculates the number of valid `k` values.
- It ensures that the constraints of type 1 and 2 are respected by setting `bx` and `ax` accordingly.
- It correctly identifies and excludes values from `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
