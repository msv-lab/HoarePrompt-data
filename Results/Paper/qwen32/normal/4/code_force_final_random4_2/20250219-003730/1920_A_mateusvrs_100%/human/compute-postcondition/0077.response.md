The code snippet `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Since `x` is the second integer from the input, it will be added to the set `cx`. The other variables (`t`, `r`, `n`, `ax`, `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 1, `r` is a list with an additional element appended to it, `n` is greater than 0, `ax` is 1000000007, `a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `cx` contains all its previous elements plus `x`.**
