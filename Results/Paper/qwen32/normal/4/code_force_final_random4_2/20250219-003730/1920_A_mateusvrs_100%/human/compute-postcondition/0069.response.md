Output State: **`t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 1, `r` is a list with an additional element appended to it, `n` is greater than 1, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` is not 1, `bx` is -1. If `a` is 2, `ax` is set to the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. Otherwise, `cx` is a set containing `x`.**

In this state, `ax` has been updated to be the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, while all other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
