The code `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `tmp` is initially 2 if `i` is between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), and 1 otherwise. After the increment, `tmp` will be 3 if `i` was between `bx` and `ax`, and 2 if `i` was not in that range. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t`, `bx`, and `ax` are as described in the precondition; `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`; `tmp` is 3 if `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `tmp` is 2; `cx` must be an iterable with at least three elements; `i` is the third element of `cx`.**
