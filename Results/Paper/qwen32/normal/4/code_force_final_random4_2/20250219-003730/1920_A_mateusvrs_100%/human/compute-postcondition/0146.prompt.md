Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; `r` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cx = set()
    ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
    bx = -1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, x = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1:
            bx = max(x, bx)
        elif a == 2:
            ax = min(x, ax)
        else:
            cx.add(x)
    if bx > ax:
        r.append(0)
    else:
        tmp = 0
        for i in cx:
            if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                tmp += 1
        r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the initial state of the program variables; `r` is a list with an additional element appended to it. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, the additional element is `0`. Otherwise, the additional element is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 1, `r` is a list with `n` additional elements appended to it, `n` is the input integer, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values added when `a` was not 1 or 2, `ax` is the minimum value of `x` encountered when `a` was 2, and `bx` is the maximum value of `x` encountered when `a` was 1. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, `r` includes one more element `0`. Otherwise, `r` includes the new element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the total count of values in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 2, `r` is a list, `n` is 0, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` where `a` is 1, and `cx` is a set containing all `x` where `a` is neither 1 nor 2. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, `r` includes an additional element `0`. If `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `r` contains one element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the number of elements in `cx` that satisfy `bx <= i <= ax`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
