The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the iterable `cx`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the iterable `cx` and the variable `i`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second element of `cx`. For the loop to execute one more time, `cx` must have at least three elements, and `i` should be the third element of `cx`.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:
- `i` should be the third element of `cx`.
- `cx` must be an iterable with at least three elements.

State: **`t`, `bx`, and `ax` are as described in the precondition; `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`; `tmp` is 2 if `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `tmp` is 1; `cx` must be an iterable with at least three elements; `i` is the third element of `cx`.**
