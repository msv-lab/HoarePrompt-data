Output State: **`t` is 0, `r` is a list containing the results of all test cases.**

### Natural Language Explanation:

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` (which initially represents the number of test cases) will be reduced to 0, as the loop executes exactly `t` times. The variable `r` will be a list that contains the result of each test case. Each result is determined as follows:

- For each test case, `n` inputs are processed.
- `cx` is a set that collects all unique `x` values where `a` is neither 1 nor 2.
- `ax` keeps track of the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` is 2.
- `bx` keeps track of the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` is 1.
- If `bx` is greater than `ax`, the result for that test case is `0`.
- Otherwise, the result is calculated as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive).

Thus, after all test cases are processed, `t` will be 0, and `r` will contain the results of each test case in the order they were processed.
