Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is an input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is the new input string, `c` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 0, `slength` is an input integer, and `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`. `x` is the third character in `c`. If `x` is not in `a` and `x` is not in `b`, `no` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to `no` or the loop.**
