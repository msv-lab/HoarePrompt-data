### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine if there exists a template string `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match the template while string `c` does not. The program provided does not correctly address this requirement. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Template Matching Logic**:
   - The program checks if `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`. If so, it prints "NO". This is incorrect because the problem requires checking if there exists a template that matches `a` and `b` while not matching `c`.
   - The program then checks if any character in `c` is not in `a` and not in `b`. If it finds such a character, it prints "YES". This is also incorrect because the problem requires a template where `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not. This condition only ensures that some character in `c` is different from both `a` and `b`, but it does not guarantee that a valid template exists.

2. **Correct Template Construction**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, for each position `i` in the strings, we need to construct a template character `t_i` such that:
     - If `a_i == b_i`, then `t_i` can be `A_i` (uppercase of `a_i`), ensuring that `c_i` does not match if `c_i == a_i`.
     - If `a_i != b_i`, then `t_i` can be `a_i` (lowercase), ensuring that both `a_i` and `b_i` match while `c_i` does not if `c_i == a_i` or `c_i == b_i`.

3. **Current Implementation Flaws**:
   - The current implementation does not consider the relationship between characters at each position in `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It incorrectly assumes that the presence of a character in `c` that is not in `a` or `b` is sufficient to determine the result.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the provided program does not correctly determine if there exists a template such that `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
