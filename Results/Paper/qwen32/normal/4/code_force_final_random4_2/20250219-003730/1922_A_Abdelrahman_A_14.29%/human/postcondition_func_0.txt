The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it checks if a third string `c` is either equal to the first string `a` or the second string `b`, or if all characters in `c` are present in either `a` or `b`. For each test case, it prints 'YES' if `c` meets one of these conditions, otherwise it prints 'NO'.
