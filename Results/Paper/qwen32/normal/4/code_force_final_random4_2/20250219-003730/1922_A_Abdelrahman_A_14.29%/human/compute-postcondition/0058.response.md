Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `c` is a new input string, `i` is 0, `slength` is an input integer, and `no` is True. If `c` is not equal to `a` or `b` but all characters in `c` are in `a` and `b`, `no` remains True.**
