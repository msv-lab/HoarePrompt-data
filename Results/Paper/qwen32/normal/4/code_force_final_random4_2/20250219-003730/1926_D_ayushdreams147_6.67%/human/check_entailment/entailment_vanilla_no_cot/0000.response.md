Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in `func_1` does not ensure that any two numbers in the same group do not have matching bit values among bits from 1st to 31st bit. Instead, it uses a bitwise XOR operation with a mask to try to determine the number of groups, which is not the correct approach for this problem.

Here's a brief explanation of why the current implementation is incorrect:

- The program attempts to use the bitwise XOR operation with `(1 << 31) - 1` (which is a 32-bit number with all bits set to 1) to flip all bits of a number. However, this operation is not relevant to the problem's requirement that no two numbers in the same group should have the same bit values.

- The program then tries to count occurrences of numbers, but this counting mechanism does not ensure that the grouping condition is met.

To correctly solve the problem, one can use a different approach, such as using a set to track the bit patterns that have already been used in a group. If a number's bit pattern conflicts with an existing pattern in a group, a new group is needed.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    groups = set()
    for num in a:
        # Convert the number to a 31-bit binary string
        bit_pattern = format(num, '031b')
        if bit_pattern in groups:
            # If the bit pattern already exists in a group, we need a new group
            groups.add(bit_pattern)
        else:
            # Otherwise, add this bit pattern to the existing group
            groups.add(bit_pattern)
    return len(groups)
```

In this corrected version, each number's bit pattern is converted to a 31-bit string, and a set is used to track which bit patterns have been used. The number of unique bit patterns in the set at the end of the process gives the minimum number of groups required.
