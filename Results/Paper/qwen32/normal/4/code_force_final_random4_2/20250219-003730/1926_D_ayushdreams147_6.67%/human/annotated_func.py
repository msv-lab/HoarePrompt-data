#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_j < 2^31 for each j. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
        
    #State: `res` is the number of unique numbers in `a` that do not have their bitwise complements in `a`, and `count` is a dictionary with the net counts of the bitwise complements of numbers that were not canceled out.
    return res
    #The program returns `res`, which is the number of unique numbers in `a` that do not have their bitwise complements in `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers, and returns the count of unique numbers in `a` that do not have their bitwise complements also present in `a`.
