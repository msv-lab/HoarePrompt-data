Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_j < 2^31 for each `j`, `res` is 1, and `count` is a dictionary with one entry `{num ^ (1 << 31) - 1: 1}`.**

In natural language: The value of `res` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
