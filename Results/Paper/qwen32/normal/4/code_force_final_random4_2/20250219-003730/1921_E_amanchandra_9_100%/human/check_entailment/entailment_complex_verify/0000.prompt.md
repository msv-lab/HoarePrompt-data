You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a grid size and the positions of two entities. For each test case, it determines and prints the result of a game or scenario, which can be 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw', based on the relative positions and constraints provided.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it against the problem description. The code is intended to determine the outcome of a game where Alice and Bob move their chips on a checkered board according to specific rules. We need to ensure that the program correctly identifies the winner or if the game ends in a draw for every possible input scenario.

Here is the provided program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (r, w, a, b, c, d) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if a > c:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(a - c) // 2
            if abs(a - c) % 2:
                l = max(1, d - x)
                r = min(w, d + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1])
            else:
                l = max(1, b - x)
                r = min(w, b + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])
```

### Analysis

1. **Initial Check:**
   - The program first checks if Alice's row `a` is greater than Bob's row `c`. If true, it immediately prints "Draw". This is correct because if Alice is initially in a row below Bob, Alice cannot move up to Bob's row, and Bob can always move down to Alice's row, leading to a draw.

2. **Distance Calculation:**
   - The program calculates `x` as half the absolute difference between Alice's and Bob's rows, rounded down. This represents the maximum number of moves Alice can make vertically to reach Bob's row.
   - If the difference between Alice's and Bob's rows is odd, the program calculates the range of columns `[l, r]` that Bob's chip can be in for Alice to potentially win.
   - If the difference is even, the program calculates the range of columns `[l, r]` that Alice's chip can be in for Bob to potentially win.

3. **Winning Conditions:**
   - For an odd difference, Alice wins if Bob's chip is within the calculated column range `[l, r]` after Alice's moves.
   - For an even difference, Bob wins if Alice's chip is within the calculated column range `[l, r]` after Bob's moves.

### Potential Issues

Let's consider some edge cases to verify the correctness of the program:

1. **Alice and Bob in the same column:**
   - If Alice and Bob are in the same column, the program should correctly determine the winner based on their rows.
   - Example: `h=6, w=5, x_a=2, y_a=2, x_b=5, y_b=2` should result in "Alice" winning because Alice can move directly down to Bob's position.

2. **Alice and Bob in adjacent rows:**
   - If Alice and Bob are in adjacent rows, the program should correctly determine the winner based on their columns.
   - Example: `h=4, w=1, x_a=2, y_a=1, x_b=4, y_b=1` should result in "Bob" winning because Bob can move directly up to Alice's position.

3. **Alice and Bob in the same row:**
   - If Alice and Bob are in the same row, the program should result in a draw because neither can move vertically to reach the other.
   - Example: `h=1, w=4, x_a=1, y_a=3, x_b=1, y_b=1` should result in a "Draw".

4. **Alice in the last row and Bob in the first row:**
   - If Alice is in the last row and Bob is in the first row, the program should result in a draw because neither can move vertically to reach the other.
   - Example: `h=5, w=5, x_a=5, y_a=4, x_b=1, y_b=2` should result in a "Draw".

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and considering various edge cases, it appears that the program correctly handles all scenarios as per the problem description. The logic for determining the winner or a draw seems to be accurately implemented.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
