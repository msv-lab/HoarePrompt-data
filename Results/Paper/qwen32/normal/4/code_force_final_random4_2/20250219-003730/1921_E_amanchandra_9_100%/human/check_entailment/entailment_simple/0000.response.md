### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program to see if it correctly determines the outcome of the game based on the problem description.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the board dimensions `h` and `w`, and the initial positions of Alice's chip `(x_a, y_a)` and Bob's chip `(x_b, y_b)`.

2. **Game Logic:**
   - The key logic is based on the relative positions of Alice and Bob's chips and the possible moves they can make.
   - The program uses the condition `if a > c` (where `a` is `x_a` and `c` is `x_b`) to determine if the game will end in a draw. If Alice's chip is initially in a row that is strictly below Bob's chip, Alice cannot reach Bob's chip before Bob can reach Alice's chip, so the game ends in a draw.

3. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - If `a <= c`, the program calculates the distance `x = abs(a - c) // 2` which represents the maximum number of moves Alice can make to reach Bob's row (or vice versa).
   - If `abs(a - c)` is odd, Alice can potentially reach a range of columns from `d - x` to `d + x` (where `d` is `y_b`), and Bob can reach from `b - (x + 1)` to `b + (x + 1)` (where `b` is `y_a`).
     - If Alice's column range overlaps with Bob's column range, Alice can win.
   - If `abs(a - c)` is even, Bob can potentially reach a range of columns from `b - x` to `b + x`, and Alice can reach from `d - (x + 1)` to `d + (x + 1)`.
     - If Bob's column range overlaps with Alice's column range, Bob can win.
   - If there is no overlap in the column ranges, the game ends in a draw.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw" based on the above logic.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the outcome of the game based on the initial positions of the chips and the possible moves. The conditions and ranges are correctly calculated, and the output is determined accordingly.

**Correctness: True**
