The given initial state describes several variables (`t`, `r`, `w`, `b`, `d`, `a`, `c`) and their properties, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on these variables. The statement simply prints the string `'Draw'`.

Let's break it down:

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `r`, `w`, `b`, and `d` are integers read from the input.
- `a` and `c` are integers read from the input, with `a` being greater than `c`.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is hardcoded to output the string `'Draw'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **Draw**
