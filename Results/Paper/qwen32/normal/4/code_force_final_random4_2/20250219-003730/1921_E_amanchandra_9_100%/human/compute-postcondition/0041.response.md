Output State: **t is 0; all test cases have been processed and the corresponding results ('Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw') have been printed for each test case.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has finished executing all `t` iterations. The variable `t` has been decremented to 0, indicating that there are no more test cases left to process. For each of the `t` test cases, the program has read the input values, performed the necessary calculations, and printed either 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The state of all other variables not directly involved in the loop's operation remains unchanged from their initial state or as modified by each iteration of the loop.
