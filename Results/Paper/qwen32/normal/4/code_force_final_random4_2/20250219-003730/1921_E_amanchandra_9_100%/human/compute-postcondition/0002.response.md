The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into six parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to the variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` respectively. The initial state of `t` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers read from the input.**
