The value of `x` is calculated as the absolute difference between `a` and `c`, divided by 2 (integer division). Given that `a` is less than or equal to `c`, `abs(a - c)` is equivalent to `c - a`. Therefore, `x` becomes `(c - a) // 2`.

The values of `t`, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The only variable that changes is `x`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers read from the input; `a` is less than or equal to `c`; `x` is `(c - a) // 2`.**
