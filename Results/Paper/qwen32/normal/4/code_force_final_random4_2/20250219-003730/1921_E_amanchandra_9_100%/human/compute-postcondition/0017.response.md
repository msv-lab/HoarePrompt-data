The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` itself. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

Here is the state at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 10^4 - 1\); `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers read from the input. If `a` is greater than `c`, the values of `r`, `w`, `b`, `c`, `d` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `r` is `min(w, d + x)` if the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd, otherwise `r` is `min(w, b + x)`. `x` is `(c - a) // 2`. `l` is `max(1, d - x)` if the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd, otherwise `l` is `max(1, b - x)`**.

Since `t` is decremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the state of `t` becomes `t - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 10^4 - 1\); `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers read from the input. If `a` is greater than `c`, the values of `r`, `w`, `b`, `c`, `d` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `r` is `min(w, d + x)` if the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd, otherwise `r` is `min(w, b + x)`. `x` is `(c - a) // 2`. `l` is `max(1, d - x)` if the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd, otherwise `l` is `max(1, b - x)`**

Simplified for clarity:
State: **`t` is \(t - 1\); `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers read from the input. If `a` is greater than `c`, the values of `r`, `w`, `b`, `c`, `d` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `r` is `min(w, d + x)` if the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd, otherwise `r` is `min(w, b + x)`. `x` is `(c - a) // 2`. `l` is `max(1, d - x)` if the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd, otherwise `l` is `max(1, b - x)`**
