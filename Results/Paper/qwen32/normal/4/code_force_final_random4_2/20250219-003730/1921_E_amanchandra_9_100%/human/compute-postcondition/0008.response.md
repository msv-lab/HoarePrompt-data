Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers read from the input; `a` is less than or equal to `c`; `x` is `(c - a) // 2`; the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd; `l` is `max(1, d - x)`**.

Natural language: The value of `l` is determined to be the maximum of 1 and `d - x`. All other variables retain their initial values and constraints.
