To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully evaluate the expressions and conditions within the `print` statement based on the given initial state.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Variable Definitions and Initial State:**
   - `w`, `b`, `d`, `a`, `c` are integers read from the input.
   - `x` is calculated as `abs(a - c) // 2`.
   - `l` is calculated as `max(1, d - (abs(a - c) // 2))`.
   - `t` is defined as `t - 2` (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
   - `r` is defined as `min(w, d + x)`.

2. **Conditions in the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement contains a conditional expression inside a list indexing operation.
   - The list `['Draw', 'Alice']` is indexed based on the condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1`.

3. **Evaluate the Condition:**
   - `abs(l - b) <= x + 1`: This condition checks if the absolute difference between `l` and `b` is less than or equal to `x + 1`.
   - `abs(r - b) <= x + 1`: This condition checks if the absolute difference between `r` and `b` is less than or equal to `x + 1`.
   - If both conditions are true, the index used is `1`, which corresponds to `'Alice'`.
   - If either condition is false, the index used is `0`, which corresponds to `'Draw'`.

### Final Output Determination

The output depends on the specific values of `w`, `b`, `d`, `a`, and `c`. Since these values are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

- If `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1` evaluates to `True`, the output will be `'Alice'`.
- If `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1` evaluates to `False`, the output will be `'Draw'`.

### Final Output Format

Output: **['Draw', 'Alice'][abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1] (where l = max(1, d - (abs(a - c) // 2)), r = min(w, d + (abs(a - c) // 2)), x = abs(a - c) // 2, and the conditions are evaluated based on the input values of w, b, d, a, c)**
