The only variable in the loop head of the given for loop is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0, as the loop will iterate `t` times.

Given that `t` is already described as a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, it is already in a state that ensures the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the provided state for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is the integer value of the input, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
