You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

    #State: t is 0; all test cases have been processed and the corresponding results ('Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw') have been printed for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a grid size and the positions of two entities. For each test case, it determines and prints the result of a game or scenario, which can be 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw', based on the relative positions and constraints provided.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic step by step based on the problem description.

### Key Points of the Problem:
1. **Alice's Moves:** Down, Down-Right, Down-Left.
2. **Bob's Moves:** Up, Up-Right, Up-Left.
3. **Winning Condition:** A player wins if they move to a cell occupied by the other player's chip.
4. **Draw Condition:** If Alice cannot move (x_a = h) or Bob cannot move (x_b = 1) before the other player wins.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program's logic seems to be based on the relative positions of Alice and Bob and the number of moves they can make.

1. **Initial Check:**
   - If Alice's row (a) is greater than Bob's row (c), the program immediately prints "Draw". This is because Bob can always move up, and Alice cannot move down anymore, leading to a draw.
   
2. **Calculating Moves:**
   - If Alice's row is not greater than Bob's row, the program calculates the number of moves Alice can make vertically (`x = abs(a - c) // 2`).
   - The variable `x` represents the number of moves Alice can make to reach Bob's row or get closer to it.
   
3. **Determining the Winning Range:**
   - If the number of moves (`abs(a - c)`) is odd, the program calculates the range of columns (`l` and `r`) where Alice can be after making `x` moves.
   - If the number of moves is even, the program calculates the range of columns where Bob can be after making `x` moves.
   
4. **Checking Winning Conditions:**
   - If the number of moves is odd, the program checks if Bob's column is within the range Alice can reach after `x + 1` moves. If yes, Alice wins.
   - If the number of moves is even, the program checks if Alice's column is within the range Bob can reach after `x` moves. If yes, Bob wins.
   - Otherwise, it prints "Draw".

### Issues and Corrections:
The logic in the program seems to be based on a simplified assumption that Alice and Bob can always move optimally to reach each other. However, the logic does not correctly account for all edge cases and optimal moves.

- **Edge Cases:** The program does not correctly handle cases where Alice or Bob can force a win in fewer moves or where the board boundaries restrict their movements.
- **Optimal Moves:** The program does not consider the optimal strategy where players can force the other into a position where they cannot make a move.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle all scenarios as per the problem description. It simplifies the problem in a way that does not account for all possible optimal moves and edge cases.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
