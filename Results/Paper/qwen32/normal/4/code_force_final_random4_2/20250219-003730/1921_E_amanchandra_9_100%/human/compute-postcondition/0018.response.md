The provided code snippet reads six integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. No other operations are performed on these variables in the given code snippet. Therefore, the values of `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are updated to the values read from the input, and the other conditions and calculations mentioned in the initial state do not apply because they are part of a subsequent code block not provided here.

Output State: **`t` is \(t - 1\); `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers read from the input.**
