Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `c` is an input integer; `d` is an input string; `e` is an input string; `k` is updated to the index of the first occurrence of `d[j]` in `e` starting from index `k` plus 1; either `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`.**
