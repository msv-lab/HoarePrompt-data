Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `c` is an input integer; `d` is an input string; `e` is an input string; `j` is 4; `k` is 5 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without affecting the values of the variables.
