Output State: **`k` is `j`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `d` is a value, `e` is a value, and `d[j]` is not in `e[j:]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
