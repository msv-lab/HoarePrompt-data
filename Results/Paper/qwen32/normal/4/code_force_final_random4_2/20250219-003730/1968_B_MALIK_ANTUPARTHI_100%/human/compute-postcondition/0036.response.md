The code snippet assigns the values of `b` and `c` based on the input provided. The variables `k` and `i` are not affected by this code snippet. The value of `i` has already been incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `k` is either `b` or `j + 1` from the initial state. The values of `b` and `c` are now the integers obtained from the input.

Output State: **`k` is either `b` or `j + 1`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `b` and `c` are the integers obtained from the input.**
