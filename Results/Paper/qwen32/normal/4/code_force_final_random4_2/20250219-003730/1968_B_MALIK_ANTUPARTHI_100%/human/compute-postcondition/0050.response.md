Postcondition: **`k` is either `j + 1` if `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, otherwise `k` is `j`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. `b` is greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `d` is a value, `e` is a value. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.**
