The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables; it only exits the nearest enclosing loop or `switch` statement. Therefore, the values of `k`, `i`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` remain unchanged. The conditions specified in the initial state are also still valid.

Output State: **`k` is `j + 1`, `i` is 3, `b` is greater than 0, `c` is the second integer from the input, `d` is the input string, `e` is the next input from the user, and the character at index `j` in `d` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k` to the end of `e`. Additionally, either `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`.**
