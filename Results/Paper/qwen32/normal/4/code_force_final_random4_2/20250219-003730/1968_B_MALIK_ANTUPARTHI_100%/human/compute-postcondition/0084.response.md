Postcondition: **`k` is 0, `i` is 3, `b` is greater than 0, `c` is the second integer from the input, `d` is the input string, `e` is the next input from the user. If the character at index `j` in `d` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k` to the end of `e`, then `k` is updated to `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`. Additionally, if `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, then `k` is set to `j + 1`. Otherwise, if the character `d[j]` is not present in the substring `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to `j`.**
