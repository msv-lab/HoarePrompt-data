The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables; it only exits the nearest enclosing loop or `switch` statement. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`k` is `j`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `b` is greater than 0; `c` is an integer; `d` is a value; `e` is a value; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
