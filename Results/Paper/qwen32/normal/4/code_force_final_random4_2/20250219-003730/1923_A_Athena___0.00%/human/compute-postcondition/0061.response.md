Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 999, `n` is the newly input integer, `a` is a list with all trailing zeros removed (possibly empty), and `res` is the total count of zeros in the list `a`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, `res` will hold the total number of zeros found in the list `a`, which has had all its trailing zeros removed. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
