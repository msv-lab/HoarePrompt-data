Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input line; `res` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `res` is initialized to 0, while the values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state.
