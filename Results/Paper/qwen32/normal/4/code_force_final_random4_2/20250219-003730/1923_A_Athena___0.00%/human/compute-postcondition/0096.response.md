Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` binary integers (0s and 1s) with at least one 1. It then removes any leading and trailing zeros from the list and counts the number of 0s in the modified list, printing this count for each test case.**
