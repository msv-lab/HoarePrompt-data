Let's analyze the loop to determine its final output state.

The loop is:
```python
while a and a[-1] == 0:
    a.pop()
```

This loop will continue to execute as long as the list `a` is not empty and its last element is `0`. In each iteration, it removes the last element of the list `a` if that element is `0`.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can deduce the following:
- After the first iteration, `a` is not empty and does not end with `0`.
- After the second iteration, `a` is not empty (unless it originally only contained `0`), and `a` does not end with `0`.
- After the third iteration, `a` is not empty (unless it originally had only one element, in which case it is now empty) and does not end with `0`.

From these conditions, it is clear that the loop will continue to execute until there are no more `0`s at the end of the list `a`.

Therefore, the final output state after all iterations will be:
- The list `a` will have all trailing zeros removed.
- The variables `t`, `n`, and `res` will remain unchanged.

In natural language, the final output state is that the list `a` will no longer have any `0`s at the end, and the other variables (`t`, `n`, and `res`) will remain the same as they were initially.

Output State: **The list `a` has all trailing zeros removed, and `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.**
