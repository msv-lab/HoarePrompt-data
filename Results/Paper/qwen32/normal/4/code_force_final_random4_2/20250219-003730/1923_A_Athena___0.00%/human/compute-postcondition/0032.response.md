The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a throwaway variable, meaning it does not represent any state that needs to be preserved or modified. However, the loop runs `t` times, so the value of `t` needs to be decremented to reflect the number of remaining iterations.

Given that `t` is the number of iterations left to execute, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

The other variables `n`, `a`, and `res` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 999; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list; `res` is the number of 0s in the list `a`.**
