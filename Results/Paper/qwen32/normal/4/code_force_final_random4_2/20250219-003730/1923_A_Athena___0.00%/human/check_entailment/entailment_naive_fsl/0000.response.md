Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Moves:**
   - The program simply counts the number of free cells (`0`s) in the trimmed list of cells (after removing leading and trailing zeros). This does not account for the actual minimum number of moves required to bring all chips together into a contiguous block.
   
2. **Trimming the List:**
   - The program removes leading and trailing zeros from the list. While this might simplify the problem, it does not correctly reflect the number of moves needed to bring the chips together.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
6
0 0 1 0 1 0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- The chips are at positions 3 and 5.
- To move the chips into a single block, you can move the chip from position 5 to position 4, and then move the chip from position 3 to position 2. This requires 2 moves.

**Program Output:**
- The program will count the number of zeros in the trimmed list `[1 0 1]`, which is 1. This is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, you need to calculate the minimum number of moves required to bring all chips together. One way to do this is to calculate the cost of moving all chips to the median position of the chips. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        positions = [i for i in range(n) if a[i] == 1]
        median = positions[len(positions) // 2]
        moves = sum(abs(p - median) for p in positions)
        print(moves)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

In this corrected version, the program identifies the positions of all chips, calculates the median position, and then calculates the total number of moves required to bring all chips to this median position. This approach ensures that the chips are moved into a single block with the minimum number of operations.
