The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given that `a` is initially `[0]`, after `a.pop()` is executed, `a` will become an empty list `[]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `res`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is []; `res` is 0**.
