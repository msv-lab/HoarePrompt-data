The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual string elements, converts each of these elements to an integer, and stores them in a list named `a`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input line.**
