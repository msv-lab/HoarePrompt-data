Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block of chips without any free cells between them. The current implementation simply counts the number of free cells within the trimmed list of chips, which does not account for the actual number of moves required to consolidate the chips into a single block.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to calculate the number of operations required to move all chips to a contiguous block. This involves determining the optimal position to consolidate the chips and calculating the total number of moves needed to move each chip to this block.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Find the positions of all chips
        chip_positions = [i for i in range(n) if a[i] == 1]
        # Calculate the median position to minimize the total number of moves
        median_pos = chip_positions[len(chip_positions) // 2]
        # Calculate the number of operations needed to move all chips to the median position
        res = sum(abs(pos - median_pos) for pos in chip_positions)
        print(res)

func()
```

In this corrected version:
1. We first identify the positions of all chips.
2. We determine the median position of these chips, as moving all chips to the median position minimizes the total number of moves.
3. We then calculate the total number of moves required to move each chip to this median position and print the result.
