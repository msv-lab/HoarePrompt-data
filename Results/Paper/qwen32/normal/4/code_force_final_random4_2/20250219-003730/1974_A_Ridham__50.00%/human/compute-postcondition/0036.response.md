Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, we need to calculate the new state of the variables after the code has been executed.

The code snippet is:
```python
extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
```

This code calculates `extra_screen` by performing integer division of `extra_space` by 15 and then adding 1 to the result.

Let's break down the variables involved:
- `extra_space` is calculated as `space_x - remaining_cells`.
- `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.

Given that `extra_space` is already defined in the initial state, we can directly use it to calculate `extra_screen`.

The initial state specifies:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by the input.
- `n` is an integer greater than 0.
- `result` is a list containing one element.
- `space_x` is equal to `x`.
- `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`.
- `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`.
- `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
- `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`.
- `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2` if `y` is even, otherwise `y // 2 + 1`.

The new variable `extra_screen` is introduced by the code snippet and is calculated based on `extra_space`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `x` and `y` are integers provided by the input; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `result` is a list containing one element; `space_x` is equal to `x`; `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`; `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`; `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`; `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`; `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15 + 1`; `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2` if `y` is even, otherwise `y // 2 + 1`.**

This output state reflects the updated value of `extra_screen` while keeping all other variables unchanged.
