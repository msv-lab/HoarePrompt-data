To determine the output state after the execution of the provided code snippet, let's break down the changes step by step:

1. **Initial State Recap:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
   - `x` and `y` are integers provided by the input.
   - `n` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `result` is a list containing one element.
   - `space_x` is equal to `x`.
   - `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`.
   - `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`.
   - `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
   - If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`; otherwise, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The code calculates `extra_space` as `space_x - remaining_cells`.

3. **Impact on Variables:**
   - `extra_space` is newly calculated and added to the state.
   - Other variables remain unchanged.

4. **Output State:**
   - `t` is still an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
   - `x` and `y` are still integers provided by the input.
   - `n` is still an integer greater than 0.
   - `result` is still a list containing one element.
   - `space_x` is still equal to `x`.
   - `space_y` is still equal to `y * 4`.
   - `total_space` is still equal to `space_y + space_x`.
   - `remaining_cells` is still equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
   - `extra_space` is now equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`.
   - If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is still equal to `y // 2`; otherwise, `screen_require_for_y` is still equal to `y // 2 + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the input, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `result` is a list containing one element, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`, if `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`; otherwise, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`.**
