Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the input, `n` is 0, `result` is a list containing `t` elements, each element calculated based on the logic of the loop.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `n` will be 0 because the loop runs `n` times and `n` is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The `result` list will contain `t` elements, each element representing the number of screens required for each pair of `x` and `y` values provided as input for each test case. The values of `t`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states, except that `n` has been exhausted by the loop.
