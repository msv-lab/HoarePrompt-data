Postcondition: **`t` is still an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `x` and `y` are still integers provided by the input; `n` is still an integer greater than 0; `result` is still a list containing one element; `space_x` is still equal to `x`; `space_y` is still equal to `y * 4`; `total_space` is still equal to `space_y + space_x`; `remaining_cells` is still equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`; `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`; `extra_screen` is equal to `space_x // 15` if `space_x % 15 == 0`, otherwise `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15 + 1`; `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2` if `y` is even, otherwise `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`.**
