Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`.**

In this output state, the value of `space_y` has been updated to be `y * 4`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
