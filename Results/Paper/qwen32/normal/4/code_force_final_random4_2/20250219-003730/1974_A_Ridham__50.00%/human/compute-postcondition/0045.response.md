The given code snippet updates the value of `screen_require_for_y` to `y // 2`. This change impacts the calculation of `remaining_cells` and potentially the second element of the `result` list, but since the code does not modify `y` or `extra_screen`, those parts of the state remain as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the input, `n` is decremented by 1, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * (y // 2) - space_y`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`; otherwise, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`. `result` is a list containing two elements, the second element being `y // 2` or `extra_screen + y // 2` based on the conditions.**
