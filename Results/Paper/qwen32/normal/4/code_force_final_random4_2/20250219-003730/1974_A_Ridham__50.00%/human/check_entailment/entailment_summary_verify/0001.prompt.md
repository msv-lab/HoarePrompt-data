You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        space_x = x * 1
        space_y = y * 4
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        if y % 2 == 0:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2
        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            if space_x % 15 == 0:
                extra_screen = space_x // 15
            else:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `y`. For each test case, it calculates the number of screens required based on the given logic and returns the results as a list of integers, with each integer representing the number of screens needed for the corresponding test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Grid Size**: Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which means it has 15 cells.
2. **Icon Sizes**:
   - 1x1 icons (denoted by `x`): Each occupies 1 cell.
   - 2x2 icons (denoted by `y`): Each occupies 4 cells.
3. **Objective**: Place all icons on the minimum number of screens.

### Key Observations

- Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells. To minimize the number of screens, we should try to place as many 2x2 icons as possible.
- After placing 2x2 icons, we need to place the remaining 1x1 icons.
- Each screen can hold a maximum of 15 cells.

### Program Analysis

The program follows these steps:

1. **Input Handling**: It reads the number of test cases and then reads `x` (number of 1x1 icons) and `y` (number of 2x2 icons) for each test case.
2. **Space Calculation**:
   - `space_x` is the total space occupied by 1x1 icons (`x * 1`).
   - `space_y` is the total space occupied by 2x2 icons (`y * 4`).
3. **Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons**:
   - If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`.
   - If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`.
4. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - `remaining_cells` is the number of cells left after placing all 2x2 icons on `screen_require_for_y` screens.
5. **Handling Remaining 1x1 Icons**:
   - If `space_x` (remaining 1x1 icons) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, no additional screens are needed.
   - Otherwise, calculate the number of extra screens needed to place the remaining 1x1 icons.
6. **Output**: The program outputs the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Correctness Verification

- **Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons**: The calculation `screen_require_for_y` is correct because each screen can hold at most 2 2x2 icons (8 cells), and any remaining 2x2 icon will require an additional screen.
- **Remaining Cells Calculation**: The calculation `remaining_cells` is correct because it considers the total cells used by 2x2 icons and subtracts from the total cells available on the screens allocated for them.
- **Handling Remaining 1x1 Icons**: The program correctly calculates the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons if they do not fit in the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons.

### Testing with Examples

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case (1 1)**:
   - `y` is 1, so `screen_require_for_y` is 1.
   - `remaining_cells` is 15 - 4 = 11.
   - `space_x` is 1, which fits in the remaining cells.
   - **Output**: 1 (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case (7 2)**:
   - `y` is 2, so `screen_require_for_y` is 1.
   - `remaining_cells` is 15 - 8 = 7.
   - `space_x` is 7, which fits in the remaining cells.
   - **Output**: 1 (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case (12 4)**:
   - `y` is 4, so `screen_require_for_y` is 2.
   - `remaining_cells` is 30 - 16 = 14.
   - `space_x` is 12, which fits in the remaining cells.
   - **Output**: 2 (Correct)

The program seems to handle all the test cases correctly based on the provided logic.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
