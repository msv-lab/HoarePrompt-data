Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the input, `n` is decremented by 1, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` and `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * (y // 2) - space_y`. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1` and `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - space_y`. `result` is a list containing two elements, the second element being `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` based on the conditions.**
