Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for all cases. Specifically, the logic for handling the remaining cells and determining the number of additional screens is incorrect. Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Calculation of `screen_require_for_y`:** The program calculates the number of screens required for `2x2` icons by dividing `y` by 2 and rounding up. While this is correct in some cases, it does not account for the most efficient placement of `2x2` icons on the grid. For example, placing two `2x2` icons can leave room for more `1x1` icons than the program accounts for.

2. **Handling of `remaining_cells`:** The program calculates `remaining_cells` as the total cells on the screens used for `2x2` icons minus the cells occupied by `2x2` icons. However, it does not consider the most efficient way to place the remaining `1x1` icons on these screens.

3. **Calculation of `extra_screen`:** The program calculates the number of additional screens required for the remaining `1x1` icons by dividing the remaining cells by 15 and rounding up. This logic is flawed because it does not consider the possibility of placing `1x1` icons in the remaining spaces left by `2x2` icons.

To fix these issues, the program needs to consider the most efficient way to place both `2x2` and `1x1` icons on the screens. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that attempts to place as many `2x2` icons as possible in the most efficient manner and then fills the remaining spaces with `1x1` icons.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        screens = 0
        
        # Try to place as many 2x2 icons as possible
        while y > 0:
            if y >= 2 and x >= 2:
                # Place two 2x2 icons, which leaves 7 cells for 1x1 icons
                screens += 1
                y -= 2
                x -= 2
                if x >= 7:
                    x -= 7
                else:
                    x = 0
            elif y >= 1 and x >= 4:
                # Place one 2x2 icon, which leaves 11 cells for 1x1 icons
                screens += 1
                y -= 1
                x -= 4
                if x >= 11:
                    x -= 11
                else:
                    x = 0
            elif y >= 1 and x >= 1:
                # Place one 2x2 icon, which leaves 11 cells for 1x1 icons, but not enough 1x1 icons to fill
                screens += 1
                y -= 1
                x -= 4
            else:
                # Not enough space for a 2x2 icon, break the loop
                break
        
        # Place remaining 1x1 icons
        if x > 0:
            screens += (x + 14) // 15
        
        result.append(screens)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))

func()
```

This corrected version considers different placements of `2x2` icons to maximize the use of the screen space and then places the remaining `1x1` icons efficiently.
