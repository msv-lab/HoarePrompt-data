Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers x and y such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is assigned based on the input, while the initial conditions for `t`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
