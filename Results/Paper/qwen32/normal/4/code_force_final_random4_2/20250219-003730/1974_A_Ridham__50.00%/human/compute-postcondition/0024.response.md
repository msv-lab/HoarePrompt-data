The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that is not used within the loop body. Since the loop variable does not influence the loop's continuation or any other variables in the loop head, no state adjustments are needed for the loop variable itself.

However, we need to ensure that the loop can execute one more time based on the loop condition. The loop will execute `n` times, so at the start of the next iteration, the loop counter (which is represented by `_` but not used) should reflect that one more iteration is about to start. Since `n` determines the number of iterations, we need to ensure that `n` is still greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Given that the loop counter `_` is not used, we only need to ensure that `n` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, if `n` was greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will still be greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration, allowing the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `result` is a list containing one element, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even, or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` contains `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` contains `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is calculated as `space_x // 15` if `space_x` is a multiple of 15, or `space_x // 15 + 1` if `space_x` is not a multiple of 15.**
