The code assigns the value of `x * 1` to the variable `space_x`. Since multiplying any number by 1 does not change its value, `space_x` will be equal to `x`. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, and `result` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `space_x` is equal to `x`.**
