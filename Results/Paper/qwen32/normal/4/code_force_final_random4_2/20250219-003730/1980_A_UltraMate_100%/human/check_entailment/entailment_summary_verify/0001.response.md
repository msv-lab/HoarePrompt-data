Let's analyze the program and the original assessment to ensure the correctness of the solution.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the string `s`.

2. **Counting Problem Difficulties:**
   - The program uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating the Number of Additional Problems:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to `0`.
   - It iterates over each difficulty level in the string `'ABCDEFG'`:
     - If a difficulty level is not present in the `Counter` (i.e., `i not in hmp`), it adds `m` to `ans` because all `m` rounds need at least one problem of that difficulty.
     - If a difficulty level is present but its count is less than `m` (i.e., `hmp[i] < m`), it adds the difference (`m - hmp[i]`) to `ans` to ensure each round has a problem of that difficulty.

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the program against the provided example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `10 1 BGECDCBDED`
  - Expected Output: `2`
  - Calculation:
    - Counter: `{'B': 2, 'G': 2, 'E': 2, 'C': 1, 'D': 2}`
    - Missing difficulties: `A`, `F`
    - Additional problems needed: `2` (one for `A` and one for `F`)
    - The program correctly calculates `2`.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `10 2 BGECDCBDED`
  - Expected Output: `5`
  - Calculation:
    - Counter: `{'B': 2, 'G': 2, 'E': 2, 'C': 1, 'D': 2}`
    - Missing difficulties: `A`, `F`
    - Additional problems needed for `A`: `2`
    - Additional problems needed for `F`: `2`
    - Additional problems needed for `C`: `1`
    - Total: `5`
    - The program correctly calculates `5`.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `9 1 BBCDEFFGG`
  - Expected Output: `1`
  - Calculation:
    - Counter: `{'B': 2, 'C': 1, 'D': 1, 'E': 1, 'F': 2, 'G': 2}`
    - Missing difficulties: `A`
    - Additional problems needed: `1` (for `A`)
    - The program correctly calculates `1`.

### Additional Test Case Verification:

Let's add another test case to ensure the program handles edge cases correctly:

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `7 3 ABCDEFG`
  - Expected Output: `0`
  - Calculation:
    - Counter: `{'A': 1, 'B': 1, 'C': 1, 'D': 1, 'E': 1, 'F': 1, 'G': 1}`
    - Each difficulty level is already present at least 3 times.
    - The program should correctly calculate `0`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case based on the provided example and additional test case. The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem requirements.

**Correctness: True**

Final: **True**
