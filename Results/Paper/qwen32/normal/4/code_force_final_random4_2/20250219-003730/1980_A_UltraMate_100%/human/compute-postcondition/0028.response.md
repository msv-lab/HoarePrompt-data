To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the entire dictionary `hmp` and how the loop processes each key-value pair.

The loop iterates over each key `i` in the dictionary `hmp`. For each key, if the value `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, it adds `m - hmp[i]` to `ans`. 

Given the initial state `ans = k * m`, and the loop logic, we can generalize the final state of `ans` as follows:

1. Start with `ans = k * m`.
2. For each key-value pair in `hmp`, if `hmp[i] < m`, add `m - hmp[i]` to `ans`.

Let's denote the sum of `m - hmp[i]` for all keys `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i] < m` as `S`. Therefore, the final value of `ans` will be `k * m + S`.

In natural language, the final output state is: `ans` is the initial value `k * m` plus the sum of `m - hmp[i]` for all keys `i` in `hmp` where the value `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.

Thus, the final output state in the required format is:

Output State: **k * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)**
