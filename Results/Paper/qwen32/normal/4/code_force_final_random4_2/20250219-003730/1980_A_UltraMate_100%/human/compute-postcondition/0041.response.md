The given code snippet is `ans += m`. This line adds the value of `m` to the current value of `ans`.

Given the initial state, we know that `ans` is initially set to `m` if `i` is not in `hmp`, otherwise `ans` remains 0. After the operation `ans += m`, the value of `ans` will be `m + m` if `ans` was initially `m`, or simply `m` if `ans` was initially `0`.

Therefore, the updated value of `ans` will be:
- If `i` was not in `hmp`, `ans` was initially `m`, so `ans` becomes `m + m` which is `2 * m`.
- If `i` was in `hmp`, `ans` was initially `0`, so `ans` becomes `m`.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, `s`, `p`, `hmp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` is decremented by 1, `k * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)` remains unchanged, `s` is an input string, `p` is `'ABCDEFG'`, `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of characters in `s`, `ans` is `m` if `i` was in `hmp` or `2 * m` if `i` was not in `hmp`**.
