The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. This means the initial values of `n` and `m` are overwritten by the new input values. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'**.
