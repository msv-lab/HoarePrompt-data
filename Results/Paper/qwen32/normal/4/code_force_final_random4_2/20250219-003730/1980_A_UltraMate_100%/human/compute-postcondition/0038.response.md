Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` is decremented by 1, `k * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)` remains unchanged, `s` is an input string, `ans` is `m`, `p` is `'ABCDEFG'`, `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of characters in `s`, and `i` is not in `hmp`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated to be `m` because `ans` was initially 0 and `m` is added to it. All other variables remain unchanged as per the given initial state.
