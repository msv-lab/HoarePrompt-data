To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State and Variables:
- `n` and `m` are input integers.
- `t` is decremented by 1, but `t` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
- `k * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)` remains unchanged, but `k` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
- `s` is an input string.
- `p` is the string 'ABCDEFG', but `p` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
- `hmp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of characters in the string `s`.
- `ans` is calculated as `7 * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)`.

### Calculation of `ans`:
1. `7 * m`: This is simply 7 multiplied by the integer `m`.
2. `sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)`: This part of the expression calculates the sum of `m - hmp[i]` for each character `i` in the `Counter` object `hmp` where the frequency `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.

### Explanation:
- `hmp` is a `Counter` object, which means it contains characters from the string `s` as keys and their frequencies as values.
- For each character `i` in `hmp`, if the frequency `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, we calculate `m - hmp[i]` and sum these values.
- Finally, `ans` is the sum of `7 * m` and the calculated sum from the above step.

### Output:
Given the above explanation, the print statement `print(ans)` will output the value of `ans` which is calculated as described.

Output: **7 * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m) (where hmp is a Counter object representing the frequency of characters in the string s, and m is an input integer)**
