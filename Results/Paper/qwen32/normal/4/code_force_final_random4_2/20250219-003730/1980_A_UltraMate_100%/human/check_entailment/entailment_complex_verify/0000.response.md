### Reasoning

To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to ensure that it accurately calculates the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create for each test case. Let's break down the program and verify its logic using the annotated version and the problem description.

#### Program Logic Breakdown

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of problems) and `m` (number of rounds).
   - It then reads a string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

2. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - The program uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed**:
   - The program iterates over each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
   - If a difficulty level is not present in the `Counter`, it adds `m` to the answer because all `m` rounds need a problem of that level.
   - For each difficulty level present in the `Counter`, if the count is less than `m`, it adds the difference (`m - count`) to the answer, indicating that more problems of that level are needed to meet the requirement of `m` rounds.

#### Verification Using Annotated Code

Let's verify the logic with the annotated code and the problem description.

**State Analysis**:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\) and \(1 \leq m \leq 5\).
- `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.

**Key Steps**:
1. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - `hmp = Counter(s)` creates a dictionary-like object where keys are the difficulty levels and values are their counts in the string `s`.

2. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed**:
   - The first loop ensures that if a difficulty level is missing, `m` problems of that level are added to the answer.
   - The second loop ensures that if a difficulty level has fewer than `m` problems, the difference is added to the answer.

**Edge Cases**:
1. **No Problems in the Bank** (`n=0`):
   - The program should output `7*m` because all levels from 'A' to 'G' need `m` problems each.
   - This is correctly handled because the first loop will add `m` for each of the 7 levels.

2. **All Problems of the Same Level**:
   - The program should output `6*m` because only one level is covered, and the remaining six levels need `m` problems each.
   - This is correctly handled because the first loop will add `m` for each of the 6 missing levels, and the second loop will not add anything for the covered level since its count is already `n`.

3. **All Levels Covered but Insufficient Count**:
   - The program correctly calculates the additional problems needed by checking the count of each level and adding the difference if it is less than `m`.

4. **All Levels Covered and Sufficient Count**:
   - The program outputs `0` because no additional problems are needed.
   - This is correctly handled because the counts for all levels are at least `m`, and neither loop adds anything to the answer.

#### Testing with Example Inputs
