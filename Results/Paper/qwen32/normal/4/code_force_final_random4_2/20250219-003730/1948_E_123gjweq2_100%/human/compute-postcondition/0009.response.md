The code provided is `cliquess[left + i] = clique`. This line updates the value at the index `left + i` in the `cliquess` array to the value of `clique`. 

Given the initial state, `cliquess[left + i]` was already set to `clique` in the precondition. Therefore, executing this line again does not change the value of `cliquess[left + i]` since it is already equal to `clique`.

The values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that \(0 \leq \text{left} < \text{right} < n\), `clique` is an integer representing the current clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is \((\text{right} - \text{left} + 1) // 2\), `not_mid` is \(\text{right} - \text{left} + 1 - \text{mid}\), `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `(left + 1) + i`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
