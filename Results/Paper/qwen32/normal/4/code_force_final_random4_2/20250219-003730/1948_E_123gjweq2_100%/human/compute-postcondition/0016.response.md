The code snippet provided is:
```
cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
```

This line of code assigns the value of `clique` to the elements of the `cliquess` array starting from index `left + mid` up to `left + mid + i`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the given context, which means the code as provided would result in an error due to the undefined variable `i`. 

For the sake of this task, I will assume that the intention was to update the elements from `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` with the value of `clique`. Given this assumption, let's update the output state accordingly.

The initial state specifies:
- `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for \(i = 0\) to \(mid - 1\).

After executing the code snippet with the assumption, we will have:
- `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique` for \(i = 0\) to `not_mid - 1`.

So, the updated `cliquess` array will have the value `clique` from `left` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1`.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that \(0 \leq \text{left} < \text{right} < n\), `clique` is an integer representing the current clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is \((\text{right} - \text{left} + 1) // 2\), `not_mid` is \(\text{right} - \text{left} + 1 - \text{mid}\), `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `(left + 1) + i` for \(i = 0\) to \(mid - 1\), `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for \(i = 0\) to \(mid + not_mid - 1\), `arr[left + mid + i]` is `big_element - i` for \(i = 0\) to `not_mid - 1`**.
