Reasoning:  
The provided Python program is intended to solve the problem as described. However, there are several issues and inconsistencies in the program that make it incorrect.

1. **Initialization of `arr` and `cliquess`:**
   - The `arr` and `cliquess` arrays are initialized with zeros, but they are supposed to be filled with distinct integers and clique numbers, respectively, through the `make_array` function.

2. **Function `make_array` not defined in the program:**
   - The `make_array` function is referenced in the code but is not defined anywhere. This will lead to a `NameError` when the program attempts to call it.

3. **Incorrect logic for filling `arr` and `cliquess`:**
   - The logic described in the comments for `make_array` function seems to be intended to fill `arr` with distinct integers and `cliquess` with clique numbers. However, the function is not defined, and even if it were, the way `arr` and `cliquess` are printed in `func_1` does not match the expected output format.

4. **Output mismatch:**
   - The output format specified in the problem statement does not match the output provided in the comments. For example, the first test case in the example output should print `2 1` for `arr` and `1` for `cliques`, but the comments suggest it prints `1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2` for `arr` and `cliquess`.

5. **Incorrect calculation of the number of cliques:**
   - The number of cliques is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`, which is not necessarily the minimum number of cliques required. The problem requires creating a graph that can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques, but the provided logic does not ensure this.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
