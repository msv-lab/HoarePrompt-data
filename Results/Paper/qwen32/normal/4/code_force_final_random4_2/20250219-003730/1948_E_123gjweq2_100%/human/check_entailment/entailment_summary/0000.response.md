### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the problem description to determine if the program is correct.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to assign distinct integers to vertices from 1 to n.
   - We need to create edges between vertices (i, j) if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| â‰¤ k.
   - We need to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.
   - Each vertex should belong to exactly one clique.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The main function `func_1` calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of length `n`.
   - It then iterates over the number of cliques and calls `make_array` for each segment of vertices.
   - The `make_array` function fills segments of `arr` and `cliquess` with specific values.

3. **Issues in the Code**:
   - The `arr` list should be filled with distinct integers from 1 to n, but the current code does not guarantee this.
   - The `cliquess` list seems to be correctly filled with clique identifiers, but the `arr` list is not filled as per the problem's requirements.
   - The `make_array` function fills the `arr` list in a specific pattern (ascending and descending), but this does not ensure that the resulting graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
   - The `arr` list is not being filled with distinct integers from 1 to n, which is a requirement of the problem.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `n = 5` and `k = 4`, the expected output should be such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
   - The provided code does not ensure that the graph will be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques because the `arr` list is not being filled with distinct integers from 1 to n in a way that satisfies the edge condition.

### Conclusion:
The program does not meet the problem's requirements because the `arr` list is not being filled with distinct integers from 1 to n, and the resulting graph may not be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

**Correctness: False**
