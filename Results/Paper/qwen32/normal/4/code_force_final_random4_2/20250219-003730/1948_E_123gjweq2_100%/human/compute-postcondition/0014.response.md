The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop will execute if `not_mid` is greater than 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `not_mid` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given the formula for `not_mid`:
\[ \text{not\_mid} = (\text{right} - \text{left} + 1) - \text{mid} \]
\[ \text{mid} = \left(\frac{\text{right} - \text{left} + 1}{2}\right) \]

We can substitute `mid` into the formula for `not_mid`:
\[ \text{not\_mid} = (\text{right} - \text{left} + 1) - \left(\frac{\text{right} - \text{left} + 1}{2}\right) \]
\[ \text{not\_mid} = \left(\frac{2(\text{right} - \text{left} + 1) - (\text{right} - \text{left} + 1)}{2}\right) \]
\[ \text{not\_mid} = \left(\frac{\text{right} - \text{left} + 1}{2}\right) \]

For `not_mid` to be greater than 0, \((\text{right} - \text{left} + 1)\) must be greater than 1. This means that \((\text{right} - \text{left})\) must be at least 1.

Therefore, the condition for the loop to execute is that \((\text{right} - \text{left}) \geq 1\).

Given the initial state, we need to ensure that \((\text{right} - \text{left}) \geq 1\). Since the initial state already specifies that \(0 \leq \text{left} < \text{right} < n\), this condition is already satisfied.

Thus, no additional adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that \(0 \leq \text{left} < \text{right} < n\), `clique` is an integer representing the current clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is \((\text{right} - \text{left} + 1) // 2\), `not_mid` is \(\text{right} - \text{left} + 1 - \text{mid}\), `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `(left + 1) + i` for \(i = 0\) to \(mid - 1\), `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for \(i = 0\) to \(mid - 1\)**
