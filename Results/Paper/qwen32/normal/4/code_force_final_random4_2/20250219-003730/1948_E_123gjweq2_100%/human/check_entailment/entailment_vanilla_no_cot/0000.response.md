Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Global Variables**: The arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are used in `make_array` without being defined in its scope. These should be passed as arguments to the function or declared as global.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Clique Number**: The calculation of `cliques` as `ceil(n / k)` is incorrect. This does not guarantee the minimal number of cliques. The correct approach involves understanding how the graph is formed and partitioning it into the fewest possible cliques based on the given constraints.

3. **Edge Condition Handling**: The logic for assigning values to vertices and forming cliques is not correct. The conditions for edge formation and clique partitioning are not properly implemented.

4. **Output Format**: The output format specified in the problem statement is not adhered to. The program should output the values of `a_i`, the number of cliques, and the partition of the graph into cliques, but it does not do so correctly.

5. **No Edge Checking**: The program does not check if the edges are formed according to the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`. This is crucial for determining the correct cliques.

6. **Example Output Mismatch**: The provided example output does not match the logic implemented in the code. The code does not seem to generate the example output correctly.

To correct the program, one would need to rethink the approach to forming the graph and partitioning it into the minimal number of cliques based on the given constraints. This involves a more sophisticated algorithm than what is currently implemented.
