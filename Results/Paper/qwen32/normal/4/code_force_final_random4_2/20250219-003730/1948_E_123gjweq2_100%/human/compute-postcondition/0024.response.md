Functionality: **The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. `left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, and `clique` is an integer representing the current clique number. The function returns an array based on the given `left`, `right`, and `clique` values.**
