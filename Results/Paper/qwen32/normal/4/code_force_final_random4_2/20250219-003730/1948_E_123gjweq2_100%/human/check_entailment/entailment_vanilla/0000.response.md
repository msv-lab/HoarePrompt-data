Let's walk through the program step-by-step to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem. It only processes a single pair of `n` and `k` values.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to handle the logic for a single test case, but it's not called within a loop to handle multiple test cases.

2. **Assigning Values to Vertices**:
   - The program initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, to store the values assigned to each vertex and the clique each vertex belongs to, respectively.
   - The program calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`, which seems to be an attempt to distribute vertices into the minimum number of cliques, but it does not guarantee that the resulting graph will be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

3. **Creating the Array**:
   - The function `make_array` is intended to fill the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays for a given range of vertices (`left` to `right`) and a specific clique number (`clique`).
   - The logic inside `make_array` attempts to assign values to vertices in such a way that the constraints `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` are satisfied, but the specific assignment of values and the logic to ensure the minimum number of cliques is not correctly implemented.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the values assigned to each vertex, the number of cliques, and the clique each vertex belongs to.
   - However, the output does not necessarily reflect a valid partition of the graph into the minimum number of cliques.

**Conclusion**:
The provided program does not correctly handle multiple test cases and does not guarantee that the graph will be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. The logic for assigning values to vertices and forming cliques is flawed.

Correctness: **False**
