The code snippet provided assigns the value of `clique` to `cliquess[left + mid + i]`. Given the initial state, we know the value of `i` is `not_mid - 2`. Therefore, the index `left + mid + i` can be simplified as `left + mid + (not_mid - 2)`, which is equivalent to `left + mid + (right - left + 1 - mid - 2)`, further simplifying to `right - 1`.

Thus, the value of `cliquess[right - 1]` is updated to `clique`.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that \(0 \leq \text{left} < \text{right} < n\), `clique` is an integer representing the current clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is \((\text{right} - \text{left} + 1) // 2\), `not_mid` is \(\text{right} - \text{left} + 1 - \text{mid}\), `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `(left + 1) + i` for \(i = 0\) to \(mid - 1\), `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for \(i = 0\) to \(mid + not_mid - 1\), `arr[left + mid + i]` is `big_element - i` for \(i = 0\) to `not_mid - 2` except `arr[right - 1]` which is `left + \frac{\text{right} - \text{left} + 1}{2} + 1`, `arr[right]` is `1 + \text{left} + (\text{right} - \text{left} + 1) // 2`, `i` is `not_mid - 2`, `cliquess[right]` is `clique`, `cliquess[right - 1]` is `clique`.**
