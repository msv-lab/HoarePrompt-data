The code snippet calculates the `low` and `high` values based on the differences between `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. Given that `p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3`, the difference `p3 - p1` will always be greater than or equal to `p3 - p2`. Therefore, `low` will be `p3 - p2` and `high` will be `p3 - p1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is `p3 - p2`, `high` is `p3 - p1`.**
