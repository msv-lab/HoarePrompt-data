To determine the output of the `print(p1 - cur + p3)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state step by step.

1. **Variables and Conditions**:
   - `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\).
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `low` is defined as `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is defined as `p3 - p1` and must be at least `cur + 1`.
   - `cur` is still less than `high`.

2. **Expression to Evaluate**:
   - The expression to evaluate is `p1 - cur + p3`.

Given that `cur` is less than `high` and `high` is `p3 - p1`, we know that `cur` is less than `p3 - p1`.

The exact values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `cur` are not specified, but we can describe the expression `p1 - cur + p3` in terms of these variables.

Since `cur` is less than `p3 - p1`, `p1 - cur` will be a positive number or zero, depending on the exact value of `cur`. Adding `p3` to `p1 - cur` will result in a value that is at least `p3` (if `cur` is 0) and less than `p1 + p3` (if `cur` is `p3 - p1`).

However, without the specific values of `p1`, `p3`, and `cur`, we can't determine the exact numerical output. But we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **p1 - cur + p3 (where p1 is the first integer, p3 is the third integer, and cur is a value less than p3 - p1)**
