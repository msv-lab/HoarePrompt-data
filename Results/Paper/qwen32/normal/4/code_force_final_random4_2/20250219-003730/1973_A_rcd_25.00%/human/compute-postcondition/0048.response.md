Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `cur` is `low` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The values of the variables `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `high`, and `cur` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
