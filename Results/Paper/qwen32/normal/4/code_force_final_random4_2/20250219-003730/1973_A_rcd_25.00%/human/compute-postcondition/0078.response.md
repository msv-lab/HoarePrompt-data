To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `high` and `cur`. The condition for the loop to continue is `high >= cur`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `low` is `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is `p3 - p1`.
- If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, `cur` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `high`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`. Since `cur` is incremented by 1 under certain conditions, we need to make sure that after any potential increment, `cur` is still less than or equal to `high`.

Let's analyze the conditions:
- If `cur` is incremented by 1, it means `p1 - cur > p2 - (p3 - cur)`, and after incrementing, `cur` becomes `cur + 1`.
- For the loop to execute again, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur + 1`.

Therefore, the critical adjustment needed is to ensure that `high` is at least `cur + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is `p3 - p2`, `high` is `p3 - p1` and must be at least `cur + 1`; `cur` is still less than `high`.**
