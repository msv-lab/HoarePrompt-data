The code snippet provided is simply a `break` statement, which will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is placed in. Since there is no loop or conditional block shown in the provided code, the `break` statement does not affect any variable values. Therefore, the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `high`, and `cur` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is `p3 - p2`, `high` is `p3 - p1`, and `cur` is less than `high`.**
