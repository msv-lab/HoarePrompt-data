To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop condition `high >= cur`. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
- `low` is `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is `p3 - p1` and `high` must be at least `cur`.
- If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, `cur` remains `low`. Otherwise, `cur` is `low + 1` and `p1 - cur` is greater than `p2 - (p3 - cur)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`. Since `high` is already given to be at least `cur`, no adjustment is needed to ensure `high >= cur`.

Therefore, no changes to the variables `high` or `cur` are required for the loop to proceed, as the condition is already satisfied.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`; `low` is `p3 - p2`; `high` is `p3 - p1` and `high` must be at least `cur`; If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, `cur` remains `low`. Otherwise, `cur` is `low + 1` and `p1 - cur` is greater than `p2 - (p3 - cur)`**
