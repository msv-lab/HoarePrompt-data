To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to ensure that the condition `high >= cur` is true right before the loop starts.

Given:
- `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- Additionally, `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
- `low` is `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is `p3 - p1`.
- `cur` is `low`.

The condition for the `while` loop to execute is `high >= cur`.

Let's break down the conditions and the relationships:
- Since `cur` is initialized to `low` (`cur = low`), the condition becomes `high >= low`.
- `low` is defined as `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is defined as `p3 - p1`.

Therefore, the condition `high >= low` translates to `p3 - p1 >= p3 - p2`, which simplifies to `p2 >= p1`. This condition is already satisfied by the given constraints (0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3).

However, we need to ensure that `high` and `low` are set such that `high >= low` holds true. Given the constraints, this condition is inherently satisfied. But we should ensure that `high` and `low` are valid based on the constraints provided for `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

Since `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2` (`p3 < p1 + p2`), and `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are already constrained by 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30 and their sum is odd, we need to ensure that these values are consistent and meet the condition `high >= low`.

Given these constraints, no additional adjustments are needed for `high` and `low` to satisfy `high >= low`. Therefore, the state right before the loop can remain as provided, with the understanding that the constraints on `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` inherently satisfy the loop condition.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`; `low` is `p3 - p2`; `high` is `p3 - p1`; `cur` is `low`**
