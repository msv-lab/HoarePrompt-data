The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integer scores representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the scores. The result is determined by checking if the sum of the scores is even and then applying specific conditions to derive the output. If the sum is odd, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum possible score that can be achieved under the given constraints and prints that value.
