To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the conditions and the loop logic provided.

Here's a summary of the conditions and the loop logic:
- `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
- `low` is `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is `p3 - p1`.
- `cur` is initially set to `low`.

The loop continues as long as `high >= cur`. Inside the loop:
- If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
- Otherwise, it increments `cur` by 1.

After the loop, if it doesn't break, it prints `p3`.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `cur` could be `low` or `low + 1` depending on the condition.
- After 2 iterations: `cur` could be `low + 1` or `low + 2`.
- After 3 iterations: `cur` could be `low + 2` or `low + 3`.

The loop will continue to increment `cur` until either the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met and the loop breaks, or `cur` exceeds `high`.

Let's consider the final scenario:
- The loop will terminate when `cur` exceeds `high` or the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is satisfied.
- If the loop breaks due to the condition, it prints `p1 - cur + p3`.
- If the loop completes without breaking, it prints `p3`.

Since the loop continues to increment `cur` until `cur > high` if the condition is never met, the final output will be `p3` if the loop completes without breaking.

Output State: **p3**

In natural language, the final output state is `p3` if the loop completes all iterations without finding a `cur` that satisfies the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`.
