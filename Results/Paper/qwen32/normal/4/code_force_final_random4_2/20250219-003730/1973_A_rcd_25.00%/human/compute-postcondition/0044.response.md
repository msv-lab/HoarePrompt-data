Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `cur` is equal to `low + 1`; and `p1 - cur > p2 - (p3 - cur)`**

In natural language, the value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, so `cur` is now `low + 1`. All other conditions and variable relationships remain the same.
