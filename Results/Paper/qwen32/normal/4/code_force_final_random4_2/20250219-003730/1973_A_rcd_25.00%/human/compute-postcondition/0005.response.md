The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, none of the variables `t`, `p1`, `p2`, or `p3` are affected by this statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.**
