To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to analyze the loop's behavior and how the variables `cur`, `low`, and `high` evolve as the loop progresses.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `cur` is initialized to `low`.
   - `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `high >= cur`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, the loop prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks.
   - Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 1.

4. **Else Block:**
   - If the loop exits without breaking, it prints `p3`.

### Output State after All Iterations:
The loop will iterate until either:
- The condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is true, at which point it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks.
- `cur` exceeds `high`, at which point it prints `p3`.

Given the outputs after the first three iterations, we know that the loop has iterated at least three times without breaking. This implies that for `cur = low`, `cur = low + 1`, and `cur = low + 2`, the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` was false. Therefore, `cur` has been incremented to `low + 3`.

To determine the final output:
- If `high >= low + 3`, the loop continues and will either break on a subsequent iteration or continue until `cur` exceeds `high`.
- If `high < low + 3`, the loop will exit without breaking and print `p3`.

### Conclusion:
The loop will either print `p1 - cur + p3` when the condition is met or print `p3` if `cur` exceeds `high`.

### Output State:
- If the loop breaks during further iterations, the output will be `p1 - cur + p3` for the value of `cur` where the condition is met.
- If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, the output will be `p3`.

Since we are asked to determine the output state after all iterations, and given the provided outputs after the first three iterations, the final output state will be:

Output State: **p3**

This means that after all iterations, the loop did not find a `cur` value that satisfied the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` within the range `[low, high]`, so it printed `p3`.
