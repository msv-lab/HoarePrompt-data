Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. If the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is true, `cur` remains equal to `low`. Otherwise, `cur` is updated to `low + 1`.**
