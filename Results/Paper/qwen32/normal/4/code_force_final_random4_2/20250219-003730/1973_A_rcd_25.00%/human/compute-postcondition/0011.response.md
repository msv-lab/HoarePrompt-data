Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. Additionally, `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`. `low` is `p3 - p2` and `high` is `p3 - p1`. `cur` is `low`.**

In simple terms, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that a new variable `cur` has been introduced and assigned the value of `low`.
