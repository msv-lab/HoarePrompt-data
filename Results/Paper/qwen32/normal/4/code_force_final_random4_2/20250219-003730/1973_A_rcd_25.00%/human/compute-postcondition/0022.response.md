The code snippet increments the value of `cur` by 1. Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `cur`. All other conditions and variable relationships remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`; `low` is `p3 - p2`; `high` is `p3 - p1` and `high` must be at least `cur`; `cur` is `low + 1` and `p1 - cur` is greater than `p2 - (p3 - cur)`**.

In simpler terms, `cur` has been incremented by 1, and all other conditions and variable relationships are unchanged.
