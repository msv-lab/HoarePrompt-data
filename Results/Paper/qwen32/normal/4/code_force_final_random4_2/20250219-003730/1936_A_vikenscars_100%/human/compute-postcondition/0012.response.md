The value of `max_item_idx` is updated to the value of `i`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is `x + 2`, `ans` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`, `max_item_idx` is `x + 2`**.
