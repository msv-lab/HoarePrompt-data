To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the given code snippet on the variables. The code snippet is:

```python
ans = func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)
```

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4
- `i` is `x + 2`

The variable `ans` is assigned the result of the function `func_1` with the arguments `max_item_idx`, `max_item_idx`, `i`, and `i`. However, the function `func_1` and the variable `max_item_idx` are not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine their exact values or effects on the output state. We can only state that `ans` is now assigned the result of this function call.

The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged unless `func_1` modifies them, but based on the given information, `func_1` is not shown to modify any external variables.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is `x + 2`, `ans` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`**.
