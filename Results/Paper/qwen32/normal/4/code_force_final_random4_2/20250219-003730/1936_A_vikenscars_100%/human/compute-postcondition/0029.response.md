Output State: **`max_item_idx` is the largest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns '<', `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`**

In simple terms: The value of `ans1` is now the result of the function call `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`. The values of `max_item_idx`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged except that `i` has been incremented by 1.
