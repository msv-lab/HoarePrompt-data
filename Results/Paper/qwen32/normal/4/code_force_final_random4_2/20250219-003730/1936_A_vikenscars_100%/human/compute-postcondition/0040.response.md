The code snippet `pair_idx = i` updates the value of `pair_idx` to be equal to `i`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `ans1`, `ans2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`, `ans2` is the result of `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)`, `pair_idx` is `i + 1`**

In natural language: The value of `pair_idx` is now `i + 1`. The values of `i`, `n`, `ans1`, and `ans2` remain the same as they were before the code execution.
