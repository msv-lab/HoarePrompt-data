The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the largest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns '<'. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.

Since the loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the next integer after its current value. Given that `i` was the largest value from 1 to `n-1` that satisfied the condition in the previous iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 to check the next value.

State: **`max_item_idx` is the largest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns '<', `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1**
