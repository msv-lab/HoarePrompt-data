The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` changes from 1 to 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty stripped input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the second character of `b`, `i` is 2, `work` is False.**
