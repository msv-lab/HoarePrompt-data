Output State: **`counter` is 2, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `a[j + 1]` is not equal to `b[j]`, and it is not the case that `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of `counter`, `a`, `a[j + 1]`, and `b[j]` remain unchanged. The execution of the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement.
