Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains an integer greater than 0; `n` remains the input integer; `a` remains the stripped input string; `b` remains the newly stripped input string; `ans` is the final constructed string based on the alternating characters from `a` and `b`; `i` is `len(a)`; `work` is False; `counter` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(a) - 1):
    if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
        counter += 1
    elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
        counter = 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a stripped input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `ans` is the final constructed string based on the alternating characters from `a` and `b`, `i` is at least 2, `work` is False. If the character at index `j + 1` in `a` is equal to the character at index `j` in `b`, then `counter` is 2. Otherwise, `counter` is 1. If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', the conditions remain as specified. Otherwise, either `a[j + 1]` is not equal to '0' or `b[j]` is not equal to '1', and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a stripped input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `ans` is the final constructed string based on the alternating characters from `a` and `b`, `i` is at least 2, `work` is False, `j` is 3. If `a[j + 1]` equals `b[j]`, then `counter` is incremented by 1. If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', then `counter` is set to 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a stripped input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `ans` is the final constructed string based on alternating characters from `a` and `b`, `i` is at least 2, `work` is False, `j` is 4. If `a[j + 1]` equals `b[j]`, `counter` is incremented by 1. If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', `counter` is set to 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
