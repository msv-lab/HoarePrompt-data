The code snippet `counter += 1` increments the value of the variable `counter` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a stripped input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `ans` is the final constructed string based on the alternating characters from `a` and `b`, `i` is at least 2, `work` is False, `j` is 3, `counter` is incremented by 1.**
