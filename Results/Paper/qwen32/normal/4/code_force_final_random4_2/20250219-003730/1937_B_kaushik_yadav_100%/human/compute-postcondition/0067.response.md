The only variable in the loop head is `j`. Given the loop statement `for j in range(len(a) - 1):`, we need to adjust `j` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 4. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `len(a) - 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a stripped input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `ans` is the final constructed string based on the alternating characters from `a` and `b`, `i` is at least 2, `work` is False, `j` is 4**
