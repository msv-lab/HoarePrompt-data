The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. For each test case, it constructs a new string `ans` by selectively choosing characters from the top and bottom strings based on specific conditions. It then prints the constructed string `ans` and a counter value representing the length of the longest prefix of the top string that matches a suffix of the bottom string under certain conditions.
