Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty stripped input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `work` is False. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, then `i` is 0 and `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the first character of `b`. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `ans` is the first character of `a`.**
