Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5) followed by two binary strings of length `n`, representing the top and bottom rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

In simple terms, `t` has been assigned the value of the number of test cases provided by the input. The other conditions and variables remain as they were described in the initial state.
