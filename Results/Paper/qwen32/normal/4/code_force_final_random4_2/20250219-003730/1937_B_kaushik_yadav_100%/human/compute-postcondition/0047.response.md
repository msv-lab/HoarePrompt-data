Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty stripped input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `work` is False. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, the state remains unchanged with `i` as it was. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, then `i` is 0 and `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the first character of `b`. If `i + 1 < len(a)` but `b[i] >= a[i + 1]`, then `i` is 1 and `ans` is the first character of `a`. If `work` is False, `i` is 1 and `ans` is the first character of `b`.**
