Postcondition: **`a` is a non-empty string, and the character at position `j + 1` in `a` is not equal to the character at position `j` in `b`. If the character at position `j + 1` in `a` is '0' and the character at position `j` in `b` is '1', then `counter` is set to 1. Otherwise, either the character at position `j + 1` in `a` is not '0' or the character at position `j` in `b` is not '1', and we exit the most internal loop or if statement.**
