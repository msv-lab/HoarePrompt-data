Postcondition: ***`j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the final count based on the loop conditions, `t` is at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `ans` is `ans` plus the second-to-last character of `a`. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, `work` is False. Otherwise, `work` is either True or False, and if `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `ans` is also updated to include the second-to-last character of `b`. If `i` is `len(a) - 1`, no further changes are made to `ans`.***
