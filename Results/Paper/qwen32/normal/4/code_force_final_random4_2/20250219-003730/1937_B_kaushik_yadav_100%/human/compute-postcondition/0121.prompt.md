Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the newly stripped input string, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `work` is True, `j` is `len(a) - 2` or the loop breaks early, and `counter` is the final value after all iterations.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `i` is 0 if `i + 1` equals the length of `a` and `work` is `False` with `b[i] < a[i + 1]`; otherwise, `i` is 1, `work` is `False`, `j` is `len(a) - 2` or the loop breaks early, and `counter` is the final value after all iterations. `ans` is the first character of `a` if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `work` is `False` with `b[i] < a[i + 1]`; otherwise, `ans` is the first character of `b`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `i` is either unchanged or `i + 1` (depending on the condition and must still be less than the length of `a`), `work` is `False`, `j` is `len(a) - 2` or the loop breaks early, and `counter` is the final value after all iterations. `ans` is the first character of `a` if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `work` is `False` with `b[i] < a[i + 1]`; otherwise, `ans` is the first character of `b` concatenated with `a[i]`. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `ans` is the first character of `b` concatenated with `a[i]` and then concatenated with `b[i]`. If `work` is `False` and `i` is incremented, `ans` is the previous `ans` concatenated with `b[i]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `work` is `False`, `i` is `len(a) - 1` or the loop breaks early, `counter` is the final value after all iterations. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, `ans` is the previous `ans` concatenated with `a[i]`. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, `ans` is the previous `ans` concatenated with `b[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is the previous `ans` concatenated with `b[i]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
