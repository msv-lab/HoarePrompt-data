Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is an input string. If the `i`th character of `a` is equal to the `i`th character of `b`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to the `i`th character of `a` and `vt` remains 0. If the `i`th character of `a` is not equal to the `i`th character of `b`, then `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If `vt` was initially 0, `vt` is now 1, `kq1` contains the value of `x` and `kq2` contains the value of `y` if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, otherwise `kq1` contains the value of `y` and `kq2` contains the value of `x`. If `vt` was not 0, then `kq1` contains the value of `y` and `kq2` contains the value of `x`.**
