To determine what will be printed by the `print(kq1)` statement, we need to understand the context and the rules that form the string `kq1`. However, the initial state provided does not specify the exact rules or the values that form `kq1`. Given the information available, we can only describe `kq1` based on the rules described without knowing the exact input strings `a` and `b` or the specific logic that generates `kq1`.

Since the exact formation rules of `kq1` are not provided, we can only describe it as a string that is formed based on some rules using the input strings `a` and `b`.

Output: **kq1 (where kq1 is a string formed by the rules described using the input strings a and b)**
