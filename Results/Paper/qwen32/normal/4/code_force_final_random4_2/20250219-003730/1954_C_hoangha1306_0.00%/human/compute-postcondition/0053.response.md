Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is an input string, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `min(int(a[i-1]), int(b[i-1]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[i-1]), int(b[i-1]))`, `vt` is 1. If `a[i] > b[i]`, then `kq1` is `kq1` + str(x) and `kq2` is `kq2` + str(y). Otherwise, `kq1` is `kq1` + str(y) and `kq2` is `kq2` + str(x).**
