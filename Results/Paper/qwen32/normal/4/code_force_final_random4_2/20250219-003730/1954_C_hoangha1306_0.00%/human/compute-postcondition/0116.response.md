Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is 2, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[2]` and `b[2]`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[2]` and `b[2]`. If `vt` was originally 0, then `vt` is set to 1. `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is concatenated with the string representation of `x`. Otherwise, `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is concatenated with the string representation of `x`. In both cases, the concatenation to `kq1` and `kq2` is based on the values of `y` and `x` respectively, where `x` is the minimum and `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[2]` and `b[2]`.**
