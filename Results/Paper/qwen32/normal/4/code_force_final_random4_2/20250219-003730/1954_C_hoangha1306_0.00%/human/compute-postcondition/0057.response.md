Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is an input string, `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are each concatenated with `a[i]`. Otherwise, `x` is `min(int(a[i-1]), int(b[i-1]))` and `y` is `max(int(a[i-1]), int(b[i-1]))`. If `vt` was 0, it is updated to 1. `kq1` is concatenated with `str(y)` and `kq2` is concatenated with `str(x)` if `a[i] > b[i]`; otherwise, `kq1` is concatenated with `str(x)` and `kq2` is concatenated with `str(y)`. If `vt` was not 0, `kq1` is concatenated with `str(y)` and `kq2` is concatenated with `str(x)` regardless of the comparison between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**
