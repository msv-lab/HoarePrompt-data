The code snippet `kq1 = kq1 + str(y)` appends the string representation of `y` to the existing value of `kq1`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `vt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is an input string, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `vt` is 1, `kq1` is the previous value of `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `y`.**
