Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a new input string, `kq1` is the character at index `i` of `a`, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0, `q` is `q + 1`. The characters at index `i` of `a` and `b` are equal.**

In natural language: The character at index `i` of string `a` has been appended to `kq1`, making `kq1` equal to that character. All other variables remain unchanged.
