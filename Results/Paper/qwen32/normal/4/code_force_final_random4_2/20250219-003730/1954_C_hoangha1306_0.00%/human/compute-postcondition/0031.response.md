Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is an input string, `i` is `i + 1`, `kq1` is the previous value of `kq1` concatenated with the character `a[i]`, `kq2` is the previous value of `kq2` concatenated with the character `a[i]`. The loop continues to the next iteration.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `kq1`, and `kq2` are updated as described, and the loop proceeds to its next iteration without executing any further code in the current iteration.
