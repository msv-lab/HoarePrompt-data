The code snippet provided appends the string representation of `x` to the variable `kq2`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `y`, `vt`, and `kq1`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is an input string, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `min(int(a[i-1]), int(b[i-1]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[i-1]), int(b[i-1]))`, `vt` is 1, `kq1` is `kq1` + str(y), `kq2` is `kq2` + str(x)**

In natural language: The output state is that `t` remains an input integer within the range 1 to 1000, `a` remains a non-empty string, `b` remains an input string, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains the minimum value between the integer representations of the characters at position `i-1` in `a` and `b`, `y` remains the maximum value between the integer representations of the characters at position `i-1` in `a` and `b`, `vt` remains 1, `kq1` has the string representation of `y` appended to it, and `kq2` has the string representation of `x` appended to it.
