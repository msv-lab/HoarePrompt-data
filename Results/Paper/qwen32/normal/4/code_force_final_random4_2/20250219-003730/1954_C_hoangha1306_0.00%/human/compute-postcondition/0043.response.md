The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop continues as long as `i` is less than the length of string `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 again.

Given:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `a` is a non-empty string
- `b` is an input string
- `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration

State at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is an input string, `i` is `i + 1`**
