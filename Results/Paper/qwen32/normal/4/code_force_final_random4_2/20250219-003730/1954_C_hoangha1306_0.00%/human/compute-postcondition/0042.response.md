Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is an input string, `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i] == b[i]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are each concatenated with the character `a[i]`. If `a[i] != b[i]`, `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, and `kq1` is concatenated with `str(y)` while `kq2` is concatenated with `str(x)`. If `vt` was 0, then `vt` is now 1. The loop continues to the next iteration.**
