The code snippet `kq2 = kq2 + str(x)` appends the string representation of `x` to the string `kq2`. Given that `kq2` was initially an empty string, after this operation, `kq2` will contain the string representation of `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is an input string, `kq1` is a string containing the value of `y`, `kq2` is a string containing the value of `x`, `vt` is not equal to 0, and the characters at index `i` in `a` and `b` are not equal; `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**
