Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 1, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is 0, `x` is `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`. The condition `vt == 0` is false. The current character at index `i` of `a` is greater than the current character at index `i` of `b`.**
