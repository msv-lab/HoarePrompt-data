Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a new input string, `q` is `q + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `kq1` is `kq1` + `a[i]`, `kq2` is `kq2` + `a[i]`, `vt` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged, `y` remains unchanged.**

In simple terms: The value of `kq2` is updated to include the character `a[i]`. All other variables retain their previous values.
