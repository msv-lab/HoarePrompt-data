### Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's break down the problem and the provided code to understand why.

#### Problem Breakdown:

The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

The condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b))\) implies that \(a + b\) must be divisible by \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Provided Code Analysis:

The provided code is:
```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = n
    root = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1
    for i in range(2, root + 1):
        cnt = i * i
        ans += (n + i) // cnt
    print(ans)
```

The annotated version describes the state of the program:
- The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
- For each test case, it calls `func_1`.
- Inside `func_1`, it reads \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(m\)).
- It initializes `ans` to \(n\).
- It calculates `root` as \(\sqrt{n} + 1\).
- It iterates from \(2\) to `root` and updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for each \(i\).
- Finally, it prints `ans`.

#### Issues with the Code:

1. **Incorrect Variable Names:**
   - The variable `k` in `func_1` should be `m` as per the problem statement.

2. **Incorrect Logic:**
   - The logic inside `func_1` does not match the problem requirements. The code is counting something related to divisors, but it does not check the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b))\).

3. **Mismatched Output:**
   - The provided code does not produce the correct output for the given examples. For instance, for the input `2 3`, the expected output is `3`, but the code does not compute this correctly.

#### Verification with Example:

Let's verify with the example provided in the problem statement:

**Input:**
```
1
2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- For \((a, b) = (1, 1)\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\), and \(2 \mod 1 = 0\). Valid.
- For \((a, b) = (1, 2)\): \(1 + 2 = 3\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(1, 2) = 2\), and \(3 \mod 2 \neq 0\). Invalid.
- For \((a, b) = (1, 3)\): \(1 + 3 = 4\) and \(3 \cdot \gcd(1, 3) = 3\), and \(4 \mod 3 \neq 0\). Invalid.
- For \((a, b) = (2, 1)\): \(2 + 1 = 3\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\), and \(3 \mod 1 = 0\). Valid.
- For \((a, b) = (2, 2)\): \(2 + 2 = 4\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\), and \(4 \mod 2 = 0\). Valid.
- For \((a, b) = (2, 3)\): \(2 + 3 = 5\) and \(3 \cdot \gcd(2, 3) = 3\), and \(5 \mod 3 \neq 0\). Invalid.

So, the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\), resulting in 3 valid pairs.

**Output of Provided Program:**
The provided program does not produce the correct output for this input. It seems to be counting something else entirely.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
