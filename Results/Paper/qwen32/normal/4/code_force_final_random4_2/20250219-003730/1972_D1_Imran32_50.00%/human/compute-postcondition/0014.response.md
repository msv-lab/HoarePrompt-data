Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6). For each test case, it returns a value based on the relationship between `n` and `m`. The function handles up to 10^4 test cases, with the constraint that the sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^6.**
