### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the provided Python program and compare it with the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Problem Description:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

2. **Program Code:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()`.
   - `func_1()` reads two integers `n` and `k` (which should be `m` based on the problem description).
   - It initializes `ans` to `n` and iterates from `2` to the square root of `n` (inclusive).
   - For each `i`, it adds `(n + i) // (i * i)` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Function Summary:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates `ans` starting from `n` and adds to it the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for each `i` from `2` to the square root of `n` rounded up.
   - The result is then printed.

4. **Original Assessment:**
   - The program is claimed to be incorrect because it does not implement the logic to check the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b))\).
   - The provided code seems to be counting something else entirely.

5. **Evaluation:**
   - The function summary aligns with the code, but neither matches the problem description.
   - The problem requires checking each pair \((a, b)\) to see if \(a + b\) is divisible by \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The provided code does not perform any such checks. Instead, it performs a calculation involving sums and divisors that is not related to the problem's requirements.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not solve the problem as described. It seems to be solving a different problem or counting a different quantity.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
