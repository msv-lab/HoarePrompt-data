Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The function `func_1()` in the annotated program does not implement this logic. Instead, it appears to be calculating something related to the sum of certain integer divisions, which is not relevant to the problem at hand. Specifically:

1. The function reads two integers `n` and `k` (note that the second variable should be `m` according to the problem statement).
2. It initializes `ans` to `n`.
3. It calculates the square root of `n` and iterates from `2` to the square root of `n` plus one.
4. For each `i` in this range, it calculates `(n + i) // (i * i)` and adds this value to `ans`.
5. Finally, it prints `ans`.

This logic does not match the problem's requirements. To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Given the constraints, a direct approach might be inefficient, and optimizations such as precomputing gcd values or using mathematical insights would be necessary.

Since the provided function does not implement the correct logic, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
