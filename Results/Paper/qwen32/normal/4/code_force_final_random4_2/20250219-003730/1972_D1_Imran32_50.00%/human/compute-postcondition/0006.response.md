The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `root`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `root`. If `i` is less than `root + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` is `i * i`, `i` is unchanged, and `ans` is updated to `ans + (n + i) // (i * i)`. Since `i` is unchanged at the end of the iteration, it means `i` has not been modified within the loop body (or its value has been restored). Therefore, `i` remains the same as it was at the start of the last iteration.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `root + 1`.

State: **`cnt` is `i * i`, `i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is updated to `ans + (n + i) // (i * i)`, `root` remains unchanged** 

However, since `cnt` and `ans` are not part of the loop head, we only adjust `i` and `root` as per the loop head:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `root` remains unchanged**
