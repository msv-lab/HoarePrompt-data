Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The provided code does not implement the logic to check the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b))\). Instead, it appears to be implementing a different logic related to counting divisors, which is not aligned with the problem requirements.

Let's consider a simple example to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- For \((a, b) = (1, 1)\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\), and \(2 \mod 1 = 0\). Valid.
- For \((a, b) = (1, 2)\): \(1 + 2 = 3\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(1, 2) = 2\), and \(3 \mod 2 \neq 0\). Invalid.
- For \((a, b) = (1, 3)\): \(1 + 3 = 4\) and \(3 \cdot \gcd(1, 3) = 3\), and \(4 \mod 3 \neq 0\). Invalid.
- For \((a, b) = (2, 1)\): \(2 + 1 = 3\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\), and \(3 \mod 1 = 0\). Valid.
- For \((a, b) = (2, 2)\): \(2 + 2 = 4\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\), and \(4 \mod 2 = 0\). Valid.
- For \((a, b) = (2, 3)\): \(2 + 3 = 5\) and \(3 \cdot \gcd(2, 3) = 3\), and \(5 \mod 3 \neq 0\). Invalid.

So, the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\), resulting in 3 valid pairs.

**Output of Provided Program:**
The provided program does not produce the correct output for this input. It seems to be counting something else entirely.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
