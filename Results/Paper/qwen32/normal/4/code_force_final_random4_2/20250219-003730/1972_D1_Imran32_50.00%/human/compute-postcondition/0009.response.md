To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `root`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i + 1`.
- `root` remains unchanged.
- `cnt` is `(i + 1) * (i + 1)`.
- `ans` is updated to `ans + (n + i) // cnt`.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(2, root + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**:
   - `i` is the variable that gets incremented in each iteration.
   - `root` is the upper limit of the range and remains constant throughout the loop.

2. **Adjusting `i`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i + 1`.
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, `i` should be `i + 2` at the start of the next iteration.

3. **Adjusting `root`**:
   - `root` remains unchanged, so no adjustment is needed for `root`.

### Final State:
- `i` at the start of the next iteration should be `i + 2`.
- `root` remains the same.
- `cnt` and `ans` are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted here.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `root` remains unchanged**.
