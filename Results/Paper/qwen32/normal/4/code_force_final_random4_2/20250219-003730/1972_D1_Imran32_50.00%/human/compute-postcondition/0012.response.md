To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables change throughout its execution.

### Loop Explanation:
- **Initialization:**
  - `n` and `m` are input values.
  - `ans` is initialized to `n`.
  - `root` is initialized to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

- **Loop Structure:**
  - The loop runs from `i = 2` to `i = root`.
  - For each iteration:
    - `cnt` is calculated as `i * i`.
    - `ans` is updated by adding `(n + i) // cnt` to it.

### Loop Execution:
- The loop iterates from `i = 2` to `i = root`, meaning it will execute `root - 1` times.
- `root` is defined as `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, so the loop runs from `2` to `int(math.sqrt(n))`.

### Final Output State:
- The loop will execute until `i` reaches `root`, and `ans` will be updated accordingly in each iteration.
- The final value of `ans` will be the sum of its initial value `n` and the results of the additions performed in each iteration of the loop.

### Calculation:
- `i` will start at `2` and increment by `1` in each iteration until it reaches `root`.
- `cnt` will be `i * i` in each iteration.
- `ans` will be updated by adding `(n + i) // cnt` in each iteration.

### Final State:
- `i` will be `root` after the loop finishes.
- `root` will remain `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
- `cnt` will be `root * root` in the last iteration.
- `ans` will be the final accumulated value after all iterations.

### Conclusion:
The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations will be:

Output State: **ans is the sum of its initial value `n` and the results of the additions `(n + i) // (i * i)` for each `i` from `2` to `root`.**

In simpler terms, `ans` will be the initial value of `n` plus the cumulative result of the integer division `(n + i) // (i * i)` for each `i` from `2` to `int(math.sqrt(n))`.
