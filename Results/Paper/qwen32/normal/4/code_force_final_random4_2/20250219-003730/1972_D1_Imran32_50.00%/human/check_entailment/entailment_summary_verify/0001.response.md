### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Program Recap:
The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it calls `func_1()`. The function `func_1()` reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(m\)) and calculates a value `ans` starting from `n`. It then iterates from 2 to the square root of \(n\) and updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // (i * i)\). Finally, it prints `ans`.

#### Function Summary Recap:
The function `func_1()` reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (should be \(m\)), initializes `ans` to \(n\), and iterates from 2 to the square root of \(n\). For each iteration, it calculates `cnt` as \(i \times i\) and updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // cnt\). The result is then printed.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Variable Naming**: The variable `k` should be `m`.
2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic inside `func_1()` does not match the problem's requirements. The program is calculating something related to divisors and sums but does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
3. **Lack of Condition Checking**: The program does not check the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\) for any pairs \((a, b)\).

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\) holds. This can be computationally expensive for large \(n\) and \(m\), so optimizations or alternative approaches might be necessary.

Given that the provided program logic does not match the problem requirements and does not check the necessary condition, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
