Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). The given program, however, does not implement this logic at all. Instead, it calculates a value `ans` starting from `n` and adds to it the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for each `i` from `2` to the square root of `n` rounded up. This calculation has no relation to the problem's requirements. 

The program seems to be solving a different problem, possibly something related to counting divisors or some other mathematical computation, but not the one specified in the problem statement.

Thus, the program is incorrect for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
