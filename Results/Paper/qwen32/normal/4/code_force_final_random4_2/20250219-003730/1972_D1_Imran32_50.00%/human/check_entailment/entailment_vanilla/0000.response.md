Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis

The provided program does not appear to implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - It reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (note: the variable `k` should be `m` according to the problem description).
   - It initializes `ans` to \(n\).
   - It calculates the square root of \(n\) and adds 1 to it.
   - It iterates from 2 to the square root of \(n\) (inclusive).
   - For each iteration, it calculates `cnt` as \(i \times i\) and updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // cnt\).
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Variable Naming**:
   - The problem specifies \(m\) but the program uses \(k\). This is a minor issue and can be fixed by renaming `k` to `m`.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The logic inside `func_1()` does not match the problem's requirements. The program is calculating something related to divisors and sums but does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Lack of Condition Checking**:
   - The program does not check the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\) for any pairs \((a, b)\).

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\) holds. This can be computationally expensive for large \(n\) and \(m\), so optimizations or alternative approaches might be necessary.

### Conclusion

The provided program is incorrect as it does not implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
