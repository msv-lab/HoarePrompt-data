Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. For each test case, it determines whether it is possible to repaint up to `k` parts of a ribbon consisting of `n` parts using `m` colors, under the condition that not all parts are repainted and the number of parts that cannot be repainted is less than `k`. It prints "YES" if the condition is met, otherwise "NO".**
