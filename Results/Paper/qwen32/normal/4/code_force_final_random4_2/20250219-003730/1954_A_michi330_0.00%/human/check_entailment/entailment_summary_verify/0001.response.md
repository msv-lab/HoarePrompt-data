Let's analyze the problem and the provided code along with the function summary and the original assessment.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Single Part (n = 1):**
   - If there is only one part, Bob can always repaint it regardless of the color Alice chooses. Thus, the answer is "NO".

2. **Single Color (m = 1):**
   - If there is only one color, Alice has no choice but to paint all parts the same color. Bob can then repaint any part (up to k parts) to maintain the same color. Thus, the answer is "NO".

3. **General Case:**
   - Alice needs to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color by repainting at most k parts.
   - To ensure Bob cannot achieve this, Alice should distribute the colors in a way that no single color can dominate such that Bob can repaint the remaining parts to make all parts the same color.
   - The maximum number of parts that can have the same color, if distributed evenly, is `math.ceil(n / m)`.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it means Bob can repaint the remaining parts to match the majority color, making it possible for him to make all parts the same color. Therefore, the answer is "NO".
   - Otherwise, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that no color appears more than `math.ceil(n / m)` times, making it impossible for Bob to repaint all parts to the same color with k repainting actions. Therefore, the answer is "YES".

### Code Analysis

The provided code follows the logic outlined above:

- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
- It checks two conditions:
  1. `n <= k`: If true, it means Bob can repaint all parts, so it prints "NO".
  2. `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`: If true, it means Bob can repaint enough parts to match the majority color, so it prints "NO".
- If neither condition is true, it prints "YES".

### Function Summary Analysis

The function summary provided essentially matches the logic described in the problem analysis. It correctly states that the function checks if it's possible for Bob to repaint up to `k` parts to make all parts the same color and prints "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions.

### Original Assessment Analysis

The original assessment accurately describes the logic of the problem and correctly analyzes the conditions under which Alice can prevent Bob from making all parts the same color. It also correctly explains the logic of the provided code and concludes that the program is correct.

### Conclusion

Based on the problem description, the provided code, the function summary, and the original assessment, the program appears to be correctly implemented and accurately solves the problem.

**Final: True**
