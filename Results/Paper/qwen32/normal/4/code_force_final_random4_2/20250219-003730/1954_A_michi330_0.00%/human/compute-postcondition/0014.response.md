Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000), `itest` is 2, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input.**

The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The values of `t` and `itest` remain unchanged.
