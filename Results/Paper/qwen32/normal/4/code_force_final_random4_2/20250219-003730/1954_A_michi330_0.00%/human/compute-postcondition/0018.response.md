Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000), `itest` is `t-1`, and for each of the `t` iterations, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input. Depending on the condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, either "NO" or "Yes" is printed. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their input values after each iteration.**

In simpler terms, after all the iterations are complete, the loop variable `itest` will have reached `t-1`, meaning it has processed all `t` test cases. For each test case, the program will have printed either "NO" or "Yes" based on the given condition, and the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` will remain as they were input, without any changes.
