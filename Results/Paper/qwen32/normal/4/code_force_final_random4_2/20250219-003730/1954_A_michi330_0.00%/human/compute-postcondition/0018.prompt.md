Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000)
Code of the loop:
for itest in range(0, t, 1):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('Yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `itest` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input. If the condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is true, then the if part is executed. Otherwise, the else part is executed. The values of `t`, `itest`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged regardless of which part is executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `itest` is 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input. If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`, the if part is executed; otherwise, the else part is executed. In both cases, the values of `t`, `itest`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged as they were read from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `itest` is 2, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input. If `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, the condition is satisfied; otherwise, the condition is not satisfied.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
