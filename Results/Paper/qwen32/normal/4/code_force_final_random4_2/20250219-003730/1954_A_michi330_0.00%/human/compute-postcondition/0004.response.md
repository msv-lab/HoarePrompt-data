The given initial state describes several variables and conditions, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the specific values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, or any other variables directly. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
   - `itest` is initialized to 0.
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input.
   - The condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is true.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   - The `print('NO')` statement will execute regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, or the condition because it is a direct print statement without any conditional logic or dependence on these variables.

3. **Output**:
   - Since the `print` statement does not depend on any specific values or conditions, it will always print `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
