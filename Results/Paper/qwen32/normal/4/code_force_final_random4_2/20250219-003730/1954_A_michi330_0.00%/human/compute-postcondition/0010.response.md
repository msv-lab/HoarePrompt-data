In the given task, we are provided with an initial state and a Python code snippet containing a `print` statement. The initial state describes several variables, but the code snippet only contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`.

Let's break down the given information:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
- `itest` is 1.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input.

However, the `print` statement itself is:
```python
print('NO')
```
This statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `itest`, `n`, `m`, or `k`. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not vary based on the values of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output: **NO**
