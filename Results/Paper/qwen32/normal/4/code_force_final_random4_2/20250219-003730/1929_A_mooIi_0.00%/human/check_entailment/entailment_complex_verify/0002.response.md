### Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program sorts the array in ascending order, which is a correct step towards maximizing the beauty of the array. However, the program does not calculate the beauty as described in the problem statement. Instead, it prints the sorted array elements as a space-separated string, which is not the required output.

The beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. The provided program fails to perform this calculation and instead prints the sorted array itself. Therefore, the program does not solve the problem as intended.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
