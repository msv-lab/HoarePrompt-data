Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The task is to find the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements when the array is optimally rearranged. The optimal rearrangement to maximize this beauty is to sort the array in ascending order because this will maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

However, the program sorts the array and then prints it, which does not compute the beauty of the array. The program should instead calculate the beauty by summing up the differences between consecutive elements after sorting the array.

For example, in the first test case with input `3 2 1 3`, the sorted array is `[1, 2, 3]`. The beauty is calculated as `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2`, but the program would just print `1 2 3` instead of `2`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not compute the beauty of the array but rather just prints the sorted array.

Correctness: **False**
