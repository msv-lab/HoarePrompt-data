Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the maximum beauty of an array, which is calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements when the array is rearranged. The beauty is defined as:
\[ \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \]

To maximize this beauty, we want to maximize the differences between consecutive elements. This can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending or descending order. Sorting in ascending order will give us the maximum beauty because the differences will be maximized in a non-decreasing sequence. 

### Correct Program:
The correct approach would be to:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the length of the array and the elements of the array.
3. Sort the array in ascending order.
4. Calculate the beauty by summing up the differences between consecutive elements.
5. Print the calculated beauty.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program does the following:
1. Reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, reads the length of the array and the elements of the array.
3. Sorts the array in ascending order.
4. Converts the sorted array elements to strings and joins them with spaces.
5. Prints the joined string.

### Issues in the Provided Program:
- The program sorts the array but does not calculate the beauty.
- The program prints the sorted array instead of the calculated beauty.

### Correctness:
Since the program does not perform the required calculation to find the maximum beauty but instead prints the sorted array, it is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
