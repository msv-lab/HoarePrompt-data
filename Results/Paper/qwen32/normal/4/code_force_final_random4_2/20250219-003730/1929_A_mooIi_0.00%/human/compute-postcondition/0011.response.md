To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 499\).
- `ar` is a map object containing strings of sorted integers from the updated input.
- `n` is assigned the value of the integer input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join(ar))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `ar`**: It is mentioned that `ar` is a map object containing strings of sorted integers. A map object in Python is an iterator that applies a function to every item of an iterable (like a list) and returns a map object (which is an iterator). However, in this context, it seems like `ar` is not the result of applying a function to an iterable but rather a collection of strings representing sorted integers.

2. **`' '.join(ar)`**: The `join()` method is used to concatenate the elements of the iterable (in this case, `ar`) into a single string, with each element separated by a space `' '`.

### Detailed Explanation:
- Since `ar` is described as containing strings of sorted integers, when we join these strings with a space, the resulting string will be a space-separated list of these integer strings.

### Example:
If `ar` contains the strings `['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']`, the output will be `'1 2 3 4 5'`.

### Final Output:
Given that `ar` is a map object containing strings of sorted integers, the print statement will output these strings joined by spaces.

Output: **a space-separated string of the sorted integers contained in `ar` (where `ar` is a map object containing strings of sorted integers)**
