The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and `int(input())` reflects the value of `t`. The value of `n` is determined by the next input, which is not specified in the initial state, so `n` will take the value of the next integer input provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and `n` is an input integer.**
