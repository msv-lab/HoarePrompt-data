The given code snippet updates the variable `ar` by reading an input string, splitting it into individual components, converting each component to an integer, sorting these integers, and then converting each integer back to a string. The variables `t` and `n` are not affected by this code snippet.

Here's the breakdown:
- `ar` is reassigned to a map object containing strings of sorted integers from the input.
- `t` remains an integer such that 0 <= t <= 499.
- `n` remains an input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 499, `ar` is a map object containing strings of sorted integers from the input, `n` is an input integer.**
