### Reasoning:
The original assessment is **correct**. The provided code does not compute the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The code reads the array and sorts it, which is a step in the correct direction because the maximum beauty can be achieved by arranging the array in sorted order.

2. **Converting Elements to Strings**:
   - The line `ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))` converts the sorted integers to strings. This conversion is unnecessary and does not contribute to calculating the beauty of the array.

3. **Printing the Sorted Array**:
   - The code prints the sorted array as a space-separated string of its elements. This is not what the problem requires. The problem asks for the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, not the sorted array itself.

4. **Lack of Beauty Calculation**:
   - The code does not perform any calculation to determine the beauty of the array. It simply sorts the array and prints it, which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Sort the array.
- Compute the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
- Print this sum for each test case.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        beauty = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            beauty += ar[i] - ar[i - 1]
        print(beauty)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Final Evaluation:
Given the analysis above, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
