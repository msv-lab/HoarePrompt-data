The only object in the loop head is the variable `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the length of the string `b`. If `j` is less than the length of `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the index of the last character processed in the string `b`.

To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` should be adjusted to `j + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is '.'; `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `d` is an input integer; `b` is an input string that must have at least one character. If `b[j]` is equal to '@', then `s` is set to 1. Otherwise, `s` remains 0. If `b[j]` is '*', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `b` is non-empty or if `b[j + 1]` equals '*'. `j` is now `j + 1`**
