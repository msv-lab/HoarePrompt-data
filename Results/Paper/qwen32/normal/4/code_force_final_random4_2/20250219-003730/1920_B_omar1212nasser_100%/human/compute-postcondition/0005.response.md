The code snippet `s -= elements[-i]` subtracts the `i`-th element from the end of the `elements` list from `s`. Given the initial state, `s` is the sum of all elements in `elements`, and `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements`.

After executing `s -= elements[-i]`, the value of `s` will decrease by the value of `elements[-i]`. The values of `removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, and `pos` remain unchanged unless `pos` depends on `s` or `s2` in a way not described in the initial state. Since `pos` is defined as a list containing one element `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`, and `s2` is `sum(elements[-negatives:])`, the value of `pos` will also be updated because it depends on `s`.

Let's denote `elements[-i]` as `e_i`. The new value of `s` will be `s - e_i`. The new value of `pos` will be `[(s - e_i) - 2 * s2]`.

Output State: **`removals` must be greater than 0, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing one element `(s - e_i) - 2 * s2`, `s` is `s - e_i`, `s2` is `sum(elements[-negatives:])`.**

In natural language: The sum `s` is reduced by the value of the `i`-th element from the end of the `elements` list. The list `pos` is updated to reflect this change in `s`. The values of `removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, and `s2` remain the same.
