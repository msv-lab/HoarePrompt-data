### Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to ensure that the logic implemented in `func_1` and `func_2` aligns with the problem description and the annotated states.

1. **Reading Input and Sorting:**
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `x`, and the list `a`.
   - The list `a` is then sorted.
   - This matches the problem description where Alice and Bob play on a sorted array.

2. **Calculating the Optimal Sum:**
   - `func_2` is called with the parameters `removals=k`, `negatives=x`, and `elements=a`.
   - The function calculates the sum of the array `s` and then calculates the sum of the last `negatives` elements `s2`.
   - It initializes a list `pos` with the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` which is the sum of the array after flipping the last `negatives` elements.
   - It then iterates over the range from 1 to `removals` (inclusive) and for each iteration:
     - It subtracts the last `i` elements from `s`.
     - It updates `s2` by subtracting the last `i` elements and adding the element at position `-(negatives + i)` if `negatives + i` is within the bounds of the array.
     - It appends `s - 2 * s2` to `pos`.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from `pos`.

3. **Logic Explanation:**
   - The logic in `func_2` is designed to simulate the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob:
     - Alice removes the largest elements first (since the array is sorted, the largest elements are at the end).
     - Bob flips the smallest elements to negative (since the array is sorted, the smallest elements are at the start).
     - The function keeps track of the best possible sum after each possible number of removals by Alice and flips by Bob.

### Conclusion:
The logic in both `func_1` and `func_2` aligns with the problem description. The program correctly handles the input, sorts the array, and calculates the optimal sum after considering the removals by Alice and the flips by Bob. The function `func_2` effectively explores all possible scenarios and returns the maximum possible sum.
