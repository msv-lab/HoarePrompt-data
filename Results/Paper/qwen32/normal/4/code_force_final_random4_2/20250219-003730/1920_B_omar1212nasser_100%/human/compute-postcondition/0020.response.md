The code snippet provided is:
```
s2 += elements[-(negatives + i)]
```

Given the initial state:
- `removals` is greater than 0.
- `negatives` is a non-negative integer.
- `elements` is a list of integers.
- `pos` is a list containing elements `(s - e_i) - 2 * s2`, `s - 2 * s2`, and now also `s - 2 * s2`.
- `s` is decreased by `elements[-4]`.
- If `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, then `s2` is updated to `s2 + elements[-(negatives + i)]`.
- `i` is 4.
- `s2` is decreased by `elements[-4]`.

The code modifies `s2` by adding `elements[-(negatives + i)]` to it. Given `i` is 4, the expression `-(negatives + i)` means we are accessing the element at the index `- (negatives + 4)` from the `elements` list.

Therefore, the new value of `s2` will be the old value of `s2` plus `elements[-(negatives + 4)]`.

Output State: **`removals` is greater than 0, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing elements `(s - e_i) - 2 * s2`, `s - 2 * s2`, and now also `s - 2 * s2`, `s` is decreased by `elements[-4]`, `i` is 4, `s2` is updated to its previous value plus `elements[-(negatives + 4)]`.**
