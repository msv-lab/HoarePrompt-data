### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to solve the problem by simulating optimal moves by both Alice and Bob. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted in ascending order. This helps in easily identifying the smallest and largest elements, which are crucial for Alice's removal strategy and Bob's negation strategy.

2. **Alice's Strategy**: Alice wants to maximize the sum of the array. To do this, she will remove the smallest elements (up to `k` elements) since these elements would contribute the least to the sum.

3. **Bob's Strategy**: Bob wants to minimize the sum of the array. After Alice has removed her elements, he will negate the largest elements (up to `x` elements) since negating these will reduce the sum the most.

4. **Calculating the Potential Sums**: The function `func_2` calculates the potential sums after different combinations of Alice's removals and Bob's negations. It keeps track of the maximum possible sum after these operations.

5. **Iterative Calculation**: The function iteratively calculates the sum after removing `i` elements from Alice and adjusts the sum based on Bob's negations. It considers the scenario where Bob negates up to `x` elements, and updates the sum accordingly.

6. **Returning the Maximum Sum**: Finally, the function returns the maximum sum from all the calculated potential sums.

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Sorting**: The array is sorted, which is correct as it helps in optimal removal and negation.
- **Iterative Calculation**: The function iterates through possible removals by Alice and calculates the adjusted sums after Bob's negations. This ensures that all possible scenarios are considered.
- **Maximizing the Sum**: The function returns the maximum sum from all the calculated potential sums, which is the correct approach to find the optimal result.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the strategies for both Alice and Bob and calculates the optimal sum of the array after the game. The logic and implementation seem correct based on the problem description.
