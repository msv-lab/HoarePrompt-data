You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: removals is a non-negative integer, negatives is a non-negative integer, elements is a list of integers. It is assumed that removals and negatives are such that 0 <= removals, negatives <= len(elements).
def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    pos = []
    s = sum(elements)
    pos.append(s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:]))
    s2 = sum(elements[-negatives:])
    for i in range(1, removals + 1):
        s -= elements[-i]
        
        s2 -= elements[-i]
        
        if negatives + i <= len(elements):
            s2 += elements[-(negatives + i)]
        
        pos.append(s - 2 * s2)
        
    #State: `removals` is a non-negative integer, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `s` is `sum(elements) - sum(elements[-removals:])`, `s2` is adjusted based on the condition `negatives + i <= len(elements)` for each `i` from 1 to `removals`, and `pos` is a list with `removals + 1` elements, where the first element is `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` and the subsequent elements are `s - 2 * s2` after each iteration.
    return max(pos)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, where the first element of `pos` is `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` and subsequent elements are `s - 2 * s2` adjusted based on the condition `negatives + i <= len(elements)` for each `i` from 1 to `removals`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `removals` (a non-negative integer), `negatives` (a non-negative integer), and `elements` (a list of integers). It calculates a list `pos` where the first element is derived from the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements`, and subsequent elements are adjusted based on the number of removals allowed. The function returns the maximum value from this list `pos`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, where the first element of `pos` is `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` and subsequent elements are `s - 2 * s2` adjusted based on the condition `negatives + i <= len(elements)` for each `i` from 1 to `removals`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
