You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have an array a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n . The
game consists of two steps:

  * First, Alice will remove at most k elements from the array. 
  * Second, Bob will multiply at most x elements of the array by -1 . 

Alice wants to maximize the sum of elements of the array while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both
players play optimally.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and x (1 \leq
n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq x,k \leq n ) — the number of elements in the
array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove,
and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1
to.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 1000 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of elements of the array
after the game if both players play optimally.

    -1
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove the only element of
the array. Then, the sum of elements of the array is 0 after the game is over.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Alice to not remove any elements.
Bob will then multiply 4 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
3+1+2-4=2 .

In the fifth test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove 9, 9 . Bob will then
multiply 5, 5, 3 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
-5-5-3+3+3+2=-5 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the optimal removals and negations by Alice and Bob, respectively. Let's analyze the logic and find a counterexample.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Sorting the Array:** The array is sorted in ascending order.
2. **Initial Calculation:** The initial sum is calculated, and then the code tries to find the optimal sum by considering different removals and negations.
3. **Loop Through Removals:** The loop iterates through possible removals and calculates the sum after each removal, adjusting the sum of the largest elements that Bob can negate.

### Issues:
- **Negation Logic:** The logic for negation is flawed. The code assumes that negating the largest elements will always yield the minimum possible sum, which is not always true.
- **Removal and Negation Combination:** The code does not correctly combine the removal of elements by Alice and the negation of elements by Bob. It does not consider the optimal combination of these actions.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the following test case:
```
1
5 2 2
-1 -2 -3 4 5
```
- **Alice's Optimal Move:** Alice can remove the two smallest elements, which are `-3` and `-2`. The array becomes `[ -1, 4, 5 ]`.
- **Bob's Optimal Move:** Bob can negate the two smallest elements in the remaining array, which are `-1` and `4`. The array becomes `[ 1, -4, 5 ]`.
- **Resulting Sum:** The sum of the array is `1 - 4 + 5 = 2`.

However, the provided code will not yield this result because it does not correctly handle the combination of removals and negations.

### Expected Output:
For the above test case, the expected output is `2`.

### Actual Output:
The provided code will not yield `2` for this test case because it does not correctly handle the optimal combination of removals and negations.

### Conclusion:
The code is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases optimally. It fails to correctly combine the removal of elements by Alice and the negation of elements by Bob. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
