The code snippet provided is `s2 -= elements[-i]`. This operation subtracts the element at the `-i` index of the `elements` list from `s2`.

Given the initial state:
- `removals` must be greater than 0
- `negatives` is a non-negative integer
- `elements` is a list of integers
- `pos` is a list containing one element `(s - e_i) - 2 * s2`
- `s` is `s - e_i`
- `s2` is `sum(elements[-negatives:])`

The operation `s2 -= elements[-i]` modifies `s2` by subtracting `elements[-i]` from it. The values of `removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, `pos`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated value of `s2` is `s2 - elements[-i]`.

Output State: **`removals` must be greater than 0, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing one element `(s - e_i) - 2 * s2`, `s` is `s - e_i`, `s2` is `s2 - elements[-i]`**.
