The code appends a new value to the list `pos`. This new value is calculated as `s - 2 * s2`. The values of `removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, and `s2` remain unchanged, but `pos` now contains an additional element.

Output State: **`removals` must be greater than 0, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing elements `(s - e_i) - 2 * s2` and `s - 2 * s2`, `s2` is updated based on the condition involving `negatives` and `elements`.**
