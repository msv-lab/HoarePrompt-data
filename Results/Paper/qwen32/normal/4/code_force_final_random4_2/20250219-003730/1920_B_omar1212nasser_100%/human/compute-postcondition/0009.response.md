Postcondition: **`removals` must be greater than 0, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing one element `(s - e_i) - 2 * s2`. If `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, then `s2` is updated to `s2 - elements[-i] + elements[-(negatives + i)]`. Otherwise, `s2` remains `s2 - elements[-i]`.**
