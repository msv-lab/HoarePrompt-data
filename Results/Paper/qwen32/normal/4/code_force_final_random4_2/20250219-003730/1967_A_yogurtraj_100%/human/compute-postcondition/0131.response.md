Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the number of elements in a list, a non-negative integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case based on the given constraints.**
