The code snippet provided initializes a variable `rem` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, or `r`. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input; `r` is the smallest element in the list `a`; `rem` is 0.**
