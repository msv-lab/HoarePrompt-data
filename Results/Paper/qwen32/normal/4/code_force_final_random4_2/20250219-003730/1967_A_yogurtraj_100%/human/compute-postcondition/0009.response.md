The value of `r` is updated to `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged in terms of their described properties. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `k` is an integer provided by the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input; `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`; `rem` is 0; `y` is 0; `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`**.
