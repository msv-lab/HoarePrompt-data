Output State: **`i` is `i`; `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`; `y` is `n - 1 - i`; `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables `i`, `r`, `rem`, `y`, and `k` remain unchanged. The code only contains a `break` statement, which causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but does not alter any variable values.
