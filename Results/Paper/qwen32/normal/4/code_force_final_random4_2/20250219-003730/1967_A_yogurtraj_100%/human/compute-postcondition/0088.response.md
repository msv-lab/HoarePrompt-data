The provided code snippet updates the values of `n` and `k` based on the input. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n` is the first integer provided by the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and `ii` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration. The values of `k` and `r` are conditionally updated based on the value of `k`.

After executing the code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())`, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the first and second integers provided by the input, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer provided by the current input; `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input; `rem` is 0; `y` is 0; `ii` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration; `k` is the second integer provided by the current input.**
