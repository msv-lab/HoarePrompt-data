To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the logic of the loop and the conditions under which it breaks or continues. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
   - `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input.
   - `r` is the smallest element in the list `a`.
   - `rem` is 0.
   - `y` is 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2` (i.e., `n - 1` iterations).
   - In each iteration, the loop checks if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`.
     - If true, it sets `r` to `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` to `k % (i + 1)`, `y` to `n - 1 - i`, and `k` to 0, then breaks out of the loop.
     - If false, it decrements `k` by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` and sets `r` to `a[i + 1]`.

3. **Final Output State**:
   - The loop will execute until either `k` becomes 0 or all iterations are completed.
   - If the loop completes all `n - 1` iterations without `k` becoming 0, then `k` will be reduced to 0 by the end of the loop, and `r` will be the last element of the list `a`.

Given the conditions provided and the behavior of the loop, the final output state can be described as follows:

- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `r` will be the last element of the list `a` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking.
- `rem` will be 0 if the loop completes all iterations without breaking.
- `y` will be 0 if the loop completes all iterations without breaking.
- `k` will be 0 if the loop completes all iterations without breaking.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer provided by the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input; `r` is the last element of the list `a`; `rem` is 0; `y` is 0; `k` is 0.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `r` will be the last element of the list `a`, and `rem`, `y`, and `k` will all be 0.
