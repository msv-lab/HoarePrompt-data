The code snippet calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `(i + 1)` and assigns it to the variable `rem`. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `ii`, `i`, and `r` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100; `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 2; `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the current input; `ii` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration; `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration; `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`**.
