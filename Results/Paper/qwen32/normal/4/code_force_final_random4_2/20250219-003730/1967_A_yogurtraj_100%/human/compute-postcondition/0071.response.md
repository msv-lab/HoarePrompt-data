To determine the output state, we need to carefully consider the given code snippet and the initial state. 

The code snippet is:
```python
r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
```

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` is the first integer provided by the input and must be at least 1
- `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input
- `i` is `ii + 2`

Let's break down the code snippet:
- `a[i]` refers to the element at index `i` in the sorted list `a`.
- `k // (i + 1)` is the integer division of `k` by `i + 1`.
- `r` is assigned the value of `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`.

Since `i` is `ii + 2`, the value of `i` is determined by the value of `ii`. However, we don't have a specific value for `ii`, so we will keep `i` as `ii + 2`.

The variable `k` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we will assume that `k` is provided by the input. We will keep `k` as it is in the expression.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer provided by the input and must be at least 1, `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input, `i` is `ii + 2`, `r` is `a[ii + 2] + k // (ii + 3)`**

In natural language, this means:
- `t` remains an integer between 1 and 100.
- `n` remains the first integer provided by the input and is at least 1.
- `a` remains the sorted list of integers provided by the input.
- `i` remains `ii + 2`.
- `r` is calculated as the element at index `ii + 2` in the list `a` plus the integer division of `k` by `ii + 3`.
