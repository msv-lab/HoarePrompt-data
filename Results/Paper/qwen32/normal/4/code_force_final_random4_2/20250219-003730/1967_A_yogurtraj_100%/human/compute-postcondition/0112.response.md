The code snippet provided assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to the variable `r`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `ii`, `i`, `k`) are not affected by this assignment.

Given the initial state, `a` is a sorted list of integers, and `i` is an integer that has been incremented from the previous iteration. Therefore, `r` will take the value of the element in the list `a` at the index `i + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100; `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 2; `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the current input; `ii` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration; `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration; `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`; `r` is `a[i + 1]`.**
