The code snippet provided sets `rem` to 0. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer provided by the input; `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input; `rem` is 0; `y` is 0; `k` is the second integer provided by the input; `ii` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration; `r` is `a[0]`.**

In natural language, this means that the value of `rem` has been set to 0, while all other variables retain their previous values.
