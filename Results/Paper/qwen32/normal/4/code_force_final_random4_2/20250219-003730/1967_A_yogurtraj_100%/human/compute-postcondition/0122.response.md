Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 2, `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the current input, `ii` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `r` is `a[i] + 0 // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `0 % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, `k` is 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, and `r` is `a[i + 1]`.**
