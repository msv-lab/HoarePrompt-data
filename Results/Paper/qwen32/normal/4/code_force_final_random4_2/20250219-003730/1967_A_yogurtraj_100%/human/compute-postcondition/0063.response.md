The code snippet calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1` and assigns it to the variable `rem`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and `r` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer provided by the input and must be at least 1, `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input, `i` is `ii + 1`, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`**.
