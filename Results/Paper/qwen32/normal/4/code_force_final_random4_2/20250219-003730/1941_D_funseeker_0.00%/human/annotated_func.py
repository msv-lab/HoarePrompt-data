#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_1`. Therefore, no precondition can be described based on the variables in the function signature.
def func_1():

    #The program returns a string that is the input read from standard input, with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a line of input from the standard input, removes any leading and trailing whitespace from the input, and returns the resulting string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters, so there are no variables to describe or relationships to establish.
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())
    #The program returns the integer value returned by `func_1()`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns the integer value returned by `func_1()`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_3` does not take any parameters. It implicitly relies on the result of `func_1()`, which is expected to return a string that can be split into integer values. The returned list contains integers.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers that were obtained by splitting the string returned by `func_1()` and converting each split substring into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` returns a list of integers by splitting a string obtained from `func_1()` and converting each split substring into an integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of players such that 2 <= n <= 1000, m is an integer representing the number of throws made such that 1 <= m <= 1000, and x is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball such that 1 <= x <= n.

        ans.add(n)
    #State: `n` is an integer, `m` is 0, `x` is unchanged, and `ans` is a set. If 0 is in `ans`, then `ans` contains the integer `n`. Otherwise, `ans` does not contain 0.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: len(ans) (where len(ans) is either 0 or 2 based on whether 0 is in the set ans or not)
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: 0 n (if 0 is in ans) or (nothing) (if 0 is not in ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines the set of players who could potentially have the ball after a series of throws, based on the initial player and the rules for passing the ball. It prints the number of such players and their identifiers.
