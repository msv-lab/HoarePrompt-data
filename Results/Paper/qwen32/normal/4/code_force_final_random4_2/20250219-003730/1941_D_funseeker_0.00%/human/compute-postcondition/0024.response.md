The code snippet `ans = temp` assigns the value of `temp` to `ans`. Therefore, after this operation, `ans` will contain the same elements as `temp`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` is greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing all values `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the previous `ans` based on the value of `c`, `r` is the integer value returned by `int(func_1().split()[0])`, `c` is the value returned by `func_1().split()[1]`, and `temp` is a set containing all values `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans` based on the value of `c`.**
