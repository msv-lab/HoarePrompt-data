Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` is greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing at least one more element besides `x`, `r` is the integer value returned by `int(func_1().split()[0])`, `c` is the value returned by `func_1().split()[1]`. If `c` is '0', `temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is neither '0', '1', nor '?', `temp` is a set containing `(q - r) % n`. `q` is `q_next`, where `q_next` is the next element in `ans` other than the current `q`.**

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the variables after the if-else block executes, considering all possible values of `c` and the corresponding updates to `temp`.
