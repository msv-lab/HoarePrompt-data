Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration, `m` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration and still greater than 0, `x` is unchanged, `ans` contains all computed values `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` based on the value of `c`, `r` is the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[0]` (now as an integer), and `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[1]` (now as a string), `temp` is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
for q in ans:
    if c == '0' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q + r) % n)
    if c == '1' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q - r) % n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration, `m` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration and still greater than 0, `x` is unchanged, `ans` contains at least one element, `r` is the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[0]` (now as an integer), `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[1]` (now as a string). If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration, `m` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration and still greater than 0, `x` is unchanged, `ans` contains at least two elements, `r` is the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[0]` (now as an integer), `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[1]` (now as a string). If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` contains the element `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` additionally contains the element `(q - r) % n`. `q` is the next element in `ans`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` also contains the element `(q - r) % n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration, `m` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration and still greater than 0, `x` is unchanged, `ans` contains at least two elements, `r` is the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[0]` (now as an integer), `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[1]` (now as a string). `q` is the next element in `ans`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is '0', `temp` contains the element `(q + r) % n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
