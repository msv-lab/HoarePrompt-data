The code snippet adds the value `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Given the initial conditions, `temp` originally contains either `(q + r) % n` (if `c` is '0') or both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` (if `c` is '?'). After executing the code, `temp` will definitely contain `(q - r) % n`, and it might already contain `(q + r) % n` if `c` was '0' or '?'.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` is greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing at least one more element besides `x`, `r` is the integer value returned by `int(func_1().split()[0])`, `c` is the value returned by `func_1().split()[1]`. If `c` is '0', `temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is '?', `temp` is a set containing both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` is a set containing `(q - r) % n`.**
