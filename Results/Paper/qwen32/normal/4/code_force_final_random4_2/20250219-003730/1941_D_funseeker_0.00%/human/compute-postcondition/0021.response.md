The code snippet adds the value `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. 

Given the initial state, `temp` already contains certain elements based on the value of `c`:
- If `c` is '0', `temp` contains `(q + r) % n`.
- If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.
- If `c` is neither '0', '1', nor '?', `temp` is an empty set.

After executing `temp.add((q - r) % n)`, the following scenarios occur:
- If `c` was '0', `temp` will now contain both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.
- If `c` was '1' or '?', `temp` will still contain both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` (since `(q - r) % n` was already in `temp`).
- If `c` was neither '0', '1', nor '?', `temp` will now contain only `(q - r) % n`.

Since the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged, they are included in the output state as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` is greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing at least one more element besides `x`, `r` is the integer value returned by `int(func_1().split()[0])`, `c` is the value returned by `func_1().split()[1]`. If `c` is '0', `temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is neither '0', '1', nor '?', `temp` is a set containing `(q - r) % n`. `q` is `q_next`, where `q_next` is the next element in `ans` other than the current `q`.**
