In the given task, the for loop will execute based on the value of `m`, which is one of the values returned by the function `func_3()`. The loop head only contains the variable `_` and `m`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of `m` to be greater than 0. The variables `n` and `x` are also returned by `func_3()`, but they do not affect the execution of the loop directly. The set `ans` is initialized with `x`, but this does not affect the loop execution either.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `m`. It must be greater than 0.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing `x`**
