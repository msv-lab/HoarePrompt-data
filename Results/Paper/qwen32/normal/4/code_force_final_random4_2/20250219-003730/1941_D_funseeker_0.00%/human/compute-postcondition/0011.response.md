The code adds the value of `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged. The set `temp` now contains both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` is greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing `x`, `r` is the integer value returned by `int(func_1().split()[0])`, `c` is the value returned by `func_1().split()[1]` and is either '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.**
