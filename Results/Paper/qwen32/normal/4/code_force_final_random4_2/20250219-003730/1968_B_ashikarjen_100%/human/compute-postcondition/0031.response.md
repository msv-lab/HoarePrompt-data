Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `b` is the binary string input by the user, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is equal to `m` because there is no index less than `m` at which `b[j]` equals `a[0]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of the variables remain unchanged, and we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
