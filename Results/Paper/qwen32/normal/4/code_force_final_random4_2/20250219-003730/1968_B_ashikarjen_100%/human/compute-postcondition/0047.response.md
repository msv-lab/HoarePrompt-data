To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop and the variables involved:

1. **Loop Overview**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `a` (from index `i = 0` to `i = n-1`).
   - For each character `a[i]`, the inner `while` loop searches through `b` starting from index `j` to find the first occurrence of `a[i]`.
   - If `a[i]` is found in `b`, `k` is incremented by 1, and `j` is moved to the next position after the found character.
   - If `a[i]` is not found in `b` starting from `j`, the loop breaks, and no further iterations occur.

2. **Final Output State**:
   - The loop will continue until it either completes all iterations (`i` reaches `n`) or finds a character in `a` that is not in the remaining part of `b` starting from `j`.
   - At the end of the loop, `k` will hold the number of characters from `a` that were found in `b` in order.
   - `j` will be the position in `b` just after the last found character from `a`.

3. **Detailed Output State**:
   - `t`: Remains unchanged.
   - `a`: Remains unchanged.
   - `m`: Remains unchanged.
   - `b`: Remains unchanged.
   - `k`: The number of characters from `a` that were found in `b` in order.
   - `j`: The position in `b` just after the last found character from `a` or `m` if the loop broke early.
   - `i`: Will be equal to `n` if the loop completes all iterations, or the index at which the loop broke.

### Final Output State in the Required Format:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is a binary string of length `n`; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `b` is the binary string input by the user; `k` is the number of characters from `a` that were found in `b` in order; `j` is the position in `b` just after the last found character from `a` or `m` if the loop broke early; `i` is equal to `n` if the loop completes all iterations, or the index at which the loop broke.**

### Natural Language Explanation:

After the loop finishes executing, `k` will tell us how many characters from the string `a` were found in the string `b` in the order they appear in `a`. The variable `j` will indicate the position in `b` right after the last character of `a` that was matched, or it will be equal to `m` if the loop broke early because no more characters from `a` could be found in `b`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n` if all characters of `a` were matched, or it will be the index of the character in `a` that could not be matched in `b`. The variables `t`, `a`, `m`, and `b` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
