The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `b` is the binary string input by the user, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1. If `j` is less than `m`, `j` is the smallest index such that `b[j] == a[0]` plus 1 and `k` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `j` is equal to `m` because there is no index less than `m` at which `b[j]` equals `a[0]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
