To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop condition: `j` and `b[j] != a[i]`.

The loop condition is:
```
while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `j`:** 
   - The condition `j < m` must be true for the loop to execute.
   - Since `j` is not mentioned in the provided state, we need to ensure that `j` is initialized to a value that satisfies `j < m`.
   - Typically, `j` would be initialized to 0 for such loops.

2. **Variable `b[j] != a[i]`:**
   - The condition `b[j] != a[i]` must also be true for the loop to execute.
   - Given that `a` is a binary string of length `n` and `b` is a binary string input by the user, we need to ensure that the characters at positions `j` in `b` and `i` in `a` are different.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 before the loop, we need to consider the initial value of `i` before it is incremented. If `i` is incremented by 1 before the loop starts, it means `i` was initially 0.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `b[0] != a[0]` for the loop to execute.

### Adjustment:
- **`j`**: Initialize `j` to 0.
- **`b[j] != a[i]`**: Ensure that `b[0] != a[0]`.

### Final State:
Given the above adjustments, the state before the loop should be:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `a` is a binary string of length `n`
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `b` is the binary string input by the user
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `i` is 0 (since it is incremented to 1 before the loop starts)
- `j` is 0
- `b[0] != a[0]`

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `b` is the binary string input by the user, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `b[0] != a[0]`**
