Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; a is a binary string of length n; b is a binary string of length m; The sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of all m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The initial state of `t`, `a`, and `b` remains unchanged, while `n` and `m` are updated based on the input values.
