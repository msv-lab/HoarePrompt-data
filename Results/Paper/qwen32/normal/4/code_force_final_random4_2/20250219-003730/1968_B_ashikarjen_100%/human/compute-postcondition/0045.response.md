Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `b` is the binary string input by the user, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, and `j` is `m`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables `t`, `a`, `m`, `b`, `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The only change is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
