Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 4, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the new input, `l` is a new list of integers from the input, `p` is a list of counts of each unique element in `l`. If the maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, the if part is executed; otherwise, the else part is executed. In both cases, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `p` remain unchanged.**
