Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of elements in a list `c`, an integer `k`, and the list `c` itself consisting of `n` integers. The function returns a specific value for each test case based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the elements in `c`.**
