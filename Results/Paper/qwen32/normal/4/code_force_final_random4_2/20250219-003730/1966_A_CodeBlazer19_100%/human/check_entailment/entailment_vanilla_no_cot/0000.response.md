Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the described operations. The logic in the program is flawed because it only checks if the maximum count of any card is greater than or equal to `k` and then returns `k-1` if true, otherwise it returns the original number of cards `n`. This does not account for the optimal strategy to minimize the number of cards by performing the operations multiple times.

To correctly solve the problem, for each test case, you need to calculate the remainder of the count of each unique card when divided by `k`, and sum these remainders. This sum represents the minimum number of cards that cannot be reduced further by the given operations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
        min_cards = sum(count % k for count in p)
        if min_cards == 0:
            min_cards = k - 1
        print(min_cards)

func()
```

This program correctly computes the minimum number of cards by summing the remainders of the counts of each unique card when divided by `k`. If the sum of remainders is zero, it means all cards can be reduced to groups of `k`, and we are left with `k-1` cards.
