Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the new input, `l` is a new list of integers from the input, `p` is a list of counts of each unique element in `l`. The if-else block does not alter any of these variables based on the condition `max(p) >= k`; it simply ensures that the postconditions of both the if and else parts are met.**

This means that regardless of whether `max(p) >= k` is true or false, the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `p` retain their values as described in the precondition.
