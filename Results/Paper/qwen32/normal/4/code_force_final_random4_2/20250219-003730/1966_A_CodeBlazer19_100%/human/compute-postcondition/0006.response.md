To determine what will be printed by the `print(k - 1)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: Must be greater than 0. However, `t` is not directly used in the provided code snippet.
2. **`i`**: Not adjusted before the loop starts. Since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, `i` is irrelevant to the current print statement.
3. **`n`**: The first input integer. This value is not directly used in the provided code snippet.
4. **`k`**: The second input integer. This value is used in the print statement.
5. **`l`**: A list of integers from the input. This list is not directly used in the provided code snippet.
6. **`p`**: A list of counts of each unique element in `l`. This list is not directly used in the provided code snippet.
7. **Maximum value in `p`**: Greater than or equal to `k`. This condition is not directly related to the provided print statement.

### Code Snippet:
The only relevant line of code for this task is:
```python
print(k - 1)
```

### Analysis:
The print statement `print(k - 1)` will output the value of `k` minus 1. Since `k` is the second input integer, the output will be this integer minus 1.

### Final Output:
Output: **k - 1 (where k is the second input integer)**
