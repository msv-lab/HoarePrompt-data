Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, and `i` is less than `n`; `counter` is incremented by 1; `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and `counter` is also incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
