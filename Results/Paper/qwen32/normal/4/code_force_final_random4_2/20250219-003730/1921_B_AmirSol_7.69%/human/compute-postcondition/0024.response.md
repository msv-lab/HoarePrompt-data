The value of `i` is incremented by 2. The initial state specifies that `i` must be less than `n`. After the operation, `i` will still be less than `n` because `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and `i` was originally less than `n`. The values of `n`, `s1`, `s2`, and `counter` remain unchanged. The output state is updated to reflect the new value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, `i` is increased by 2 (but still less than `n`), `counter` is increased by 1.**
