The code snippet `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` was 0, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 1. All other variables (`n`, `s1`, `s2`, `counter`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length n consisting of '0's and '1's, `counter` is 1, `i` is 1, and `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`. It is not the case that (i < n - 1 and s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1] and s1[i] != s1[i + 1])**
