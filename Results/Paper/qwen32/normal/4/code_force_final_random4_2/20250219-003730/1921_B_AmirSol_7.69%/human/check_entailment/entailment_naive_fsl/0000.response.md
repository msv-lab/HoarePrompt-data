Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s1` to the desired state `s2` for all possible cases. 

The logic in the function `func_1` is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that if two consecutive boxes in `s1` and `s2` are different, they can be swapped in one operation. This is not always the case. For example, if `s1` is "100" and `s2` is "101", the function will incorrectly return 1 operation, when actually it requires 2 operations (move the cat from the first box to the third box).

Let's consider a test case to demonstrate the issue:

Input:
```
1
3
100
101
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Actual Output from the Program:
```
1
```

Explanation of the Correct Steps:
1. Move the cat from the first box to the third box: "100" -> "001"
2. Move the cat from the third box to the second box: "001" -> "101"

The program fails to account for the need to move cats to different positions in a way that minimizes the number of operations. It does not consider the optimal sequence of moves required in all scenarios.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
