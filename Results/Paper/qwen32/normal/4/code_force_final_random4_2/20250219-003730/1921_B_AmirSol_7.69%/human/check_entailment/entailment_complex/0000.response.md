### Reasoning:

The given program is supposed to calculate the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes (`s1`) into the desired state (`s2`). The operations allowed are adding a cat, removing a cat, or moving a cat from one box to another.

The logic in the provided function `func_1` is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly account for the minimum number of operations required. Specifically:

1. **Consecutive Mismatches Handling**: The function attempts to handle consecutive mismatches (`s1[i] != s2[i]` and `s1[i+1] != s2[i+1]`) by incrementing the counter by 1 and skipping the next character (`i += 2`). However, this logic is incorrect because it doesn't properly account for the actual operations needed to fix these mismatches. For example, if `s1` is "11" and `s2` is "00", the function would count this as 1 operation, but actually, it would take 2 operations (one to remove the cat from the first box and one to remove the cat from the second box).

2. **Non-Consecutive Mismatches Handling**: The function correctly increments the counter by 1 for non-consecutive mismatches (`s1[i] != s2[i]` and `s1[i+1] == s2[i+1]`), but it does not account for the actual operations needed. For example, if `s1` is "10" and `s2` is "01", the function would count this as 1 operation, but actually, it would take 2 operations (one to move the cat from the first box to the second box).

3. **General Approach**: The function should count the number of 1s in `s1` that need to be moved or removed and the number of 0s in `s1` that need to be filled with cats. The minimum number of operations required will be the sum of these two counts.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the current implementation of the function `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
