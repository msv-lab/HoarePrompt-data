To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `i` and the range `x`.

Given the for loop:
```python
for i in range(x):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will execute if and only if `x` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, so we don't need to adjust `i` before the loop starts.

The other variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `ans1` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `x` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values from the input split as integers, where `x` must be greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a`.**
