The code snippet `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2` modifies the value of `ans1` by subtracting twice the value of the element at index `i + x` in the list `a` from it.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers from the input, with `k` being greater than 0.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[i]` plus `a[i]`.
- `ans2` remains the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`.
- `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.

After executing the code `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2`, the value of `ans1` changes. The new value of `ans1` is the previous value of `ans1` minus twice the value of `a[i + x]`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers from the input, with `k` being greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order; `i` is incremented by 1; `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[i]` plus `a[i]` minus `a[i + x] * 2`; `ans2` remains the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`; `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.**
