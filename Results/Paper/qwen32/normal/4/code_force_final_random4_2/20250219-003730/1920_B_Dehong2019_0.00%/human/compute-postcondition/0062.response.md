The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`. Since the loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable (commonly used when the loop variable is not needed), we only need to adjust `t` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given that the loop runs `t` times, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1.

State: **`a` is sorted in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of elements from index `x` to the end of `a` plus the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` minus twice the sum of the elements starting from index `x` up to `x + k - 1` (if they exist); `ans2` is the value of `ans1` after `k-1` iterations; `ans` is the maximum of the final `ans1` and `ans2`; `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values from the input; `t` is decremented by 1**
