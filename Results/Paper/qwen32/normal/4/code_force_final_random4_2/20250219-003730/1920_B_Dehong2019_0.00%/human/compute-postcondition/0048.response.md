Postcondition: **`a` is sorted in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of elements from index `x` to the end of `a` plus `a[i]` minus `2 * a[i + x]` if `i + x < n`, otherwise it remains the sum of elements from index `x` to the end of `a` plus `a[i]`; `ans2` is the same as `ans1` before the increment; `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` before the increment; `n`, `k` must be greater than 0, and `x` are assigned the values from the input.**
