The code snippet `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` subtracts twice the value of the element at index `i` in the list `a` from `ans1`. Given that `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `a[i]` refers to a specific element in the list. Since `ans1` was initially the sum of all elements in `a`, after executing this line, `ans1` will be reduced by twice the value of `a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values from the input split as integers, where `x` must be greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the value of `a[i]`.**
