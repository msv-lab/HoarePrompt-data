Postcondition: **`a` is sorted in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of elements from index `x` to the end of `a` plus `2 * a[i]` minus `6 * a[i + x]` if `i + x < n`, otherwise it remains the sum of elements from index `x` to the end of `a` plus `2 * a[i]` minus `4 * a[i]`; `ans2` is the sum of elements from index `x` to the end of `a` plus `a[i]` minus `4 * a[i + x]` if `i + x < n`, otherwise it remains the sum of elements from index `x` to the end of `a` plus `a[i]` minus `2 * a[i]`; `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`; `n`, `k` must be greater than 0, and `x` are assigned the values from the input; `i` is `i`. If `i + x < n`, `ans1` is adjusted by subtracting an additional `2 * a[i + x]` and `ans2` by subtracting an additional `4 * a[i + x]`.**
