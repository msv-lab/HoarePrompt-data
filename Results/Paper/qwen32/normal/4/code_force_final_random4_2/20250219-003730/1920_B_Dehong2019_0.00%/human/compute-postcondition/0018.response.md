Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values from the input split as integers with `k` being greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[i]`. If `i + x` is less than `n`, then `ans1` is further adjusted by subtracting `a[i + x] * 2`. `ans2` remains the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`.**
