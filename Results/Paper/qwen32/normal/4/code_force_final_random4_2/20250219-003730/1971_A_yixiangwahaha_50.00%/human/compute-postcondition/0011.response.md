The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 10, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2.

State: **`t` is a string representing the input value, `x` is a list containing two identical integer values of `xylist[0]`, `y` is a list containing two identical integer values of `xylist[1]`, `i` is 2, `xylist` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input by spaces.**
