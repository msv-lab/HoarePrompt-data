The code appends the integer value of the second element in `xylist` to the list `y`. Since `y` was initially an empty list, it now contains one element, which is the integer value of `xylist[1]`. The values of `t`, `x`, `i`, and `xylist` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a string representing the input value, `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first element in `xylist`, `y` is a list containing the integer value of `xylist[1]`, `i` is 0, `xylist` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input by spaces.**
