The code snippet appends the integer value of `xylist[0]` to the list `x`. Given that `x` initially contains the integer value of `xylist[0]`, after the operation, `x` will contain two identical elements, both being the integer value of `xylist[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is a string representing the input value, `x` is a list containing two identical integer values of `xylist[0]`, `y` is a list containing the integer value of `xylist[1]`, `i` is 1, `xylist` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input by spaces.**
