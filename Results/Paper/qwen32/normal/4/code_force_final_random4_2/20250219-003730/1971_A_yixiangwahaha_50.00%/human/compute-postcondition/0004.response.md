The code snippet `xylist = input().split(' ')` will read a line of input from the user, split it by spaces, and assign the resulting list to the variable `xylist`. The initial state of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `i` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state will include the new variable `xylist` which holds the list of strings obtained from the input.

Output State: **`t` is a string representing the input value, `x` is an empty list, `y` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `xylist` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input by spaces.**
