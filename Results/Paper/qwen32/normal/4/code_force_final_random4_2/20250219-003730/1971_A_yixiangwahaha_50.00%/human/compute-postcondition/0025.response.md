Postcondition: **`t` is a string representing the input value, `x` is a list containing ten integers, `y` is a list containing ten integers, `i` is 1, `xylist` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input by spaces for the last iteration. If `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`, then `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`. Otherwise, `x[i]` is greater than or equal to `y[i]`. The state of `t`, `x`, `y`, `i`, and `xylist` remains unchanged after the if-else block executes.**
