Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that `n <= le`; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is `n - 1`; `r` is the index where `a[r]` is not equal to `a[r - 1]` or `r` is equal to `l`; `st` is `n`; `end` is `k`; `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`; and `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`.**
