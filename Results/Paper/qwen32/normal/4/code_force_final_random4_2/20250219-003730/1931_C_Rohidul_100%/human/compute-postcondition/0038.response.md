To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to consider the conditions specified in the loop head:

```
while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if both conditions `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]` are true.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition `l < r`:**
   - Right before the loop, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`.
   - For `l < r` to be true, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which implies `n > 1`.

2. **Condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]`:**
   - Right before the loop, `l` is 0, so this condition translates to `a[0] == a[1]`.
   - For the loop to execute, the first two elements of the list `a` must be equal.

### Adjustments Needed:

- **Adjust `n`:** Ensure that `n` is greater than 1.
- **Adjust `a`:** Ensure that `a[0]` is equal to `a[1]`.

### Final State:

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is the input integer
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the input
- `le` is the length of the list `a`
- `l` is 0
- `r` is `n - 1`
- `st` is 1
- `end` is 1
- `ans` is calculated based on the condition `a[0] == a[-1]`
- `a` is updated to the list of integers from the input

We need to ensure `n > 1` and `a[0] == a[1]`:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input where `a[0]` equals `a[1]`; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 1; `end` is 1; if `a[0] == a[-1]`, then `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`; otherwise, `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`**
