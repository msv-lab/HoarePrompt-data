In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the input value `t`. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and the `t` value which is obtained from the input. The variables `n` and `a` are defined inside the loop body and are not part of the loop head, so they cannot be adjusted according to the rules provided.

To ensure that the loop can execute, the value of `t` must be at least 1. The state of `t` is already given as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), which means the loop will execute as long as `t` is within this range.

Since the loop head only involves `t` and the loop variable `_`, and `t` is already in a valid range, no further adjustments are needed to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
