The `while` loop condition is `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `l`, `r`, and `a[l]` and `a[l + 1]` such that the condition remains `True`.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Condition `l < r`**: 
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `l` is 1 and `r` is `n - 1`.
   - To ensure `l < r` is `True`, we need to make sure `l` is still less than `r`. Since `l` is 1, we need to ensure `r` is at least 2.

2. **Condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `a[0] == a[1]`, but the loop condition involves `a[l]` and `a[l + 1]`.
   - Since `l` is 1, we need to ensure `a[1] == a[2]`.

Given these conditions, we need to adjust `r` to be at least 2 and ensure `a[1] == a[2]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input where `a[0]` equals `a[1]` and `a[1]` equals `a[2]`; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is 1; `r` is at least 2; `st` is 2; `end` is 1; if `a[0] == a[-1]`, then `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`; otherwise, `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`**

This ensures that the loop condition `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]` remains `True`, allowing the loop to execute one more time.
