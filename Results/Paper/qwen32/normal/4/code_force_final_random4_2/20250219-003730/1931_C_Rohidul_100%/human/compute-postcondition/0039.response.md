Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input where `a[0]` equals `a[1]`; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is 1; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 1; `end` is 1; if `a[0] == a[-1]`, then `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`; otherwise, `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1, changing it from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
