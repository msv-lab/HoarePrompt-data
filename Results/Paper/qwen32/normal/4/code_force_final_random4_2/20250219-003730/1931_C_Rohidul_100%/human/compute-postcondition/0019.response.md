The code snippet `end += 1` increments the value of the variable `end` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation. Given the initial state, `end` was 1, so after executing the code, `end` becomes 2.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is at least 2; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input where `a[n - 1] == a[n - 2]`; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is `n - 2`; `r` is `n - 2`; `st` is the count of the consecutive equal elements from the start, or `le` if all elements are equal; `end` is 2.**
