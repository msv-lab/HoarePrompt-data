Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided Python program to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to make all elements of an array equal using at most one operation where you can select a subarray and set all its elements to a specific value. The cost of the operation is the length of the subarray. The goal is to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.

### Key Observations:
1. **No Operation Needed**: If the entire array is already uniform (all elements are the same), the cost is 0.
2. **Single Operation**: If the array is not uniform, we can potentially make the array uniform with a single operation. The best strategy involves either:
   - Extending the leftmost uniform segment to the right.
   - Extending the rightmost uniform segment to the left.
   - Combining the leftmost and rightmost uniform segments by filling the middle part.

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the given program to see if it correctly implements the above logic.

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
2. **Finding Uniform Segments**:
   - It finds the length of the leftmost uniform segment (`st`).
   - It finds the length of the rightmost uniform segment (`end`).
3. **Calculating the Cost**:
   - If the leftmost and rightmost segments are the same, it calculates the cost as the total length minus the combined length of the leftmost and rightmost segments, ensuring it doesn't go below 0.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the cost as the total length minus the maximum of the leftmost and rightmost segment lengths.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Case Handling**: The program does not correctly handle cases where the optimal solution involves filling the middle part between the leftmost and rightmost uniform segments. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1]`, the optimal solution is to fill the middle part with `1`, but the program might incorrectly calculate the cost based only on the leftmost and rightmost segments.
2. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases, such as arrays with multiple distinct values where the optimal solution might involve a different segment than the leftmost or rightmost.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly those where the optimal solution involves filling the middle part of the array. Therefore, it is not a correct solution for the given problem.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
