The code snippet provided sets the variables `st` and `end` to 1. This means that the count of consecutive equal elements from the start (`st`) and the count of consecutive equal elements from the end (`end`) are both reset to 1. 

The initial state mentioned includes the following:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the input.
- `le` is the length of the list `a`.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n - 1`.
- `st` is the count of the consecutive equal elements from the start, or `le` if all elements are equal.
- `end` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list.
- If `a[0] == a[-1]`, then `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`; otherwise, `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`.
- `a` is updated to the list of integers from the input.

After the code snippet runs, `st` and `end` are both set to 1, while all other variables retain their previously defined states and values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 1; `end` is 1; if `a[0] == a[-1]`, then `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`; otherwise, `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`; `a` is updated to the list of integers from the input.**
