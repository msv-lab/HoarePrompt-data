The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The variable `t` representing the number of test cases and the variable `i` which is incremented by 1 are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1; `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input.**
