The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. This means the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` will be updated based on the input provided, while `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4; `i` is 4; `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input.**
