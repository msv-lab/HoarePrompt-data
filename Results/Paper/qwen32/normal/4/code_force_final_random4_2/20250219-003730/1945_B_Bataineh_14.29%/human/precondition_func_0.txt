The function receives an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives three integers a, b, and m (1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18) representing the frequency of launching fireworks for the first and second installations, and the visibility duration of each firework, respectively.
