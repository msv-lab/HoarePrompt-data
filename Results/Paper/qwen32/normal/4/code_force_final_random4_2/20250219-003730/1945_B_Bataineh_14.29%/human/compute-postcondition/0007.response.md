Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers provided by the input. If `m` is less than `a` or `m` is less than `b`, then the current value of `m` is less than `a` or `m` is less than `b`. Otherwise, `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`.**
