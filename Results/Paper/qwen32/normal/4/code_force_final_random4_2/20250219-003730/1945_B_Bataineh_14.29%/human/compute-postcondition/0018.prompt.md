Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
    if m < a or m < b:
        print(2)
    else:
        print(m // a + m // b + 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers provided by the input. If `m` is less than `a` or `m` is less than `b`, then the current value of `m` is less than `a` or `m` is less than `b`. Otherwise, `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1; `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input. Regardless of whether `m < a` or `m < b`, the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain the same after the if-else block execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `i` is 4; `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input. If `m` is less than `a` or `m` is less than `b`, the condition is met, but the postcondition for the if part is the same as the precondition. Otherwise, the postcondition for the else part is also the same as the precondition. In both cases, the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
