To ensure that the for loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head involves the variable `i` and the variable `t`.

The loop `for i in range(t):` will execute if `t` is greater than 0 because `range(t)` generates a sequence of numbers from 0 up to, but not including, `t`. If `t` is 0 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

Given the state before the loop starts: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, the value of `t` already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute because it is guaranteed to be at least 1.

However, we need to ensure that `i` is correctly initialized before the loop starts. The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be automatically initialized to 0 at the start of the first iteration of the loop. Therefore, we do not need to manually adjust `i` before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4**
