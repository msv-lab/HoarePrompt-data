The code snippet provided is `n -= 1`, which decrements the value of `n` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` must be non-zero
- `coord` is a sorted list of four tuples `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]` based on tuple comparison
- `res` is `math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)`
- `i` is 4
- `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`
- `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`

After executing `n -= 1`, the value of `n` is decreased by 1. The other variables (`t`, `coord`, `res`, `i`, `p1`, `p2`) remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is non-zero and decreased by 1; `coord` is a sorted list of four tuples `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]` based on tuple comparison; `res` is `math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)`; `i` is 4; `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`; `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**
