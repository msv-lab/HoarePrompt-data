Let's break down the given information step by step to determine the output of the `print(round(res))` statement.

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
   - `n` is a non-zero integer.
   - `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples, each tuple representing a coordinate `(x, y)`.
   - `res` is the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.
   - `i` is set to 3.
   - `x` and `y` are new integers read from the input (though they are not directly used in the calculation of `res`).
   - `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between `coord[0]` and `coord[1]`.
   - `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between `coord[3]` and `coord[2]`.

2. **Calculation of `p1` and `p2`:**
   - `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first two coordinates in the `coord` list.
   - `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the last two coordinates in the `coord` list.

3. **Calculation of `res`:**
   - `res` is the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.
   - Mathematically, `res = sqrt(p1) * sqrt(p2) = sqrt(p1 * p2)`.

4. **Output of the `print(round(res))` statement:**
   - The statement prints the rounded value of `res`.

Given the above information, the output will be the rounded value of the square root of the product of the squared Euclidean distances between the first two and the last two coordinates in the `coord` list.

Output: **rounded value of the square root of the product of the squared Euclidean distances between the first two and the last two coordinates in the `coord` list**.
