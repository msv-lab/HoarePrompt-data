Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is a non-zero integer; `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`; `res` is 0; `i` is 3; `x` and `y` are the new integers read from the input.**

In simple terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, the `coord` list will contain four tuples, each representing a pair of integers `(x, y)` read from the input. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial values, and `res` remains 0. The loop variable `i` will be 3, which is the last value it takes in the `range(4)` loop.
