The code appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the `coord` list. As a result, the `coord` list will now contain one more element, which is the tuple `(x, y)`. The values of `t`, `n`, `res`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The variables `p1` and `p2` are not affected because they are dependent on specific indices in `coord` that do not yet exist. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is 1; `coord` is a list containing one element `(x, y)`; `res` is 0; `i` is 0; `x` and `y` are the new integers read from the input; `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between `coord[0]` and `coord[1]`; `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between `coord[3]` and `coord[2]`.**
