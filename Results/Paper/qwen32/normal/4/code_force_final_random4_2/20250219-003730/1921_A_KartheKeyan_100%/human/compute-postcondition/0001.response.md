Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an input integer; `l` and `s` are not retained after the loop ends.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the input. The values of `t`, `l`, and `s` remain as per the initial state, with `t` still being an integer between 1 and 100, and `l` and `s` not being retained after the loop ends.
