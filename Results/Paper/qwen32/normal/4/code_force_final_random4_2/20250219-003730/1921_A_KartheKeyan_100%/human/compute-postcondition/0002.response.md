In the given task, the `while` loop condition is `while n:`. In Python, a non-zero integer is considered `True` in a boolean context, and a zero is considered `False`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `n` is any non-zero integer.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `l` and `s` are not retained after the loop ends.

Since `l` and `s` are not part of the loop condition and do not affect whether the loop can execute, we only need to focus on `n`. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be a non-zero integer.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure `n` is not zero.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be a non-zero integer; `l` and `s` are not retained after the loop ends.**
