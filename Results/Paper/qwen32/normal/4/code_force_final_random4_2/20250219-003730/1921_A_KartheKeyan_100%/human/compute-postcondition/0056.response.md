Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be non-zero; `coord` is a sorted list of four tuples `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]` based on tuple comparison; `res` is `math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)`; `i` is 4; `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]); `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**

In this output state, the value of `res` is calculated as the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `coord`, `i`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged from their initial state.
