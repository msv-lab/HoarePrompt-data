The code snippet appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. The other variables remain unchanged. Initially, `coord` is a list with two tuples `[(original_x, original_y), (x, y)]`. After appending `(x, y)`, `coord` will have three tuples.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is 1; `coord` is a list containing three elements `[(original_x, original_y), (x, y), (x, y)]`; `res` is 0; `i` is 2; `x` and `y` are the new integers read from the input.**
