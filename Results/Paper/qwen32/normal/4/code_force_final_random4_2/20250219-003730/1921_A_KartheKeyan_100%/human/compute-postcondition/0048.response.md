The code appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Therefore, `coord` now contains two tuples: the original `(x, y)` and the newly appended `(x, y)`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be non-zero; `coord` is a list containing two tuples `[(x, y), (x, y)]`; `res` is 0; `i` is 4; `p1` is undefined; `p2` is undefined; `x` and `y` are the integers provided by the input.**
