The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `coord`, `res`, or `i`. The variables `p1` and `p2` remain undefined. The values of `x` and `y` are updated based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be non-zero; `coord` is a list containing two tuples `[(x, y), (x, y)]`; `res` is 0; `i` is 3; `p1` is undefined; `p2` is undefined; `x` and `y` are the integers provided by the input.**
