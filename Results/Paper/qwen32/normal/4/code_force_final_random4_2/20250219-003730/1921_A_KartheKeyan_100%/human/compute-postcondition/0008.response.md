The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range it is iterating over, which is controlled by the constant `4`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the loop variable `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the loop variable controlled by `range(4)`. This means `i` can take values from `0` to `3`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by `1` from its current value, provided it is less than `4`.

Given that `i` is controlled by `range(4)`, it will automatically be incremented by `1` at the start of each new iteration. Therefore, we only need to ensure that `i` is set to the next value in the sequence.

If `i` was `0`, `1`, `2`, or `3` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `1`, `2`, `3`, or `4` respectively at the start of the next iteration. However, if `i` is `3` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will not execute again because `i` will be `4` and `4` is not in the range `0` to `3`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is a non-zero integer; `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)`; `res` is 0; `i` is the loop variable controlled by `range(4)` and is now 1; `x` and `y` are integers read from the input.**

Note: The values of `t`, `n`, `coord`, `res`, `x`, and `y` do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head. The only variable that needs adjustment is `i`. If `i` was `3` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will terminate, and no further adjustment is needed for `i`. For the sake of this task, we assume `i` has not yet reached `3`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is a non-zero integer; `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)`; `res` is 0; `i` is 1; `x` and `y` are integers read from the input.** 

If `i` was `2` at the end of the previous iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is a non-zero integer; `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)`; `res` is 0; `i` is 3; `x` and `y` are integers read from the input.** 

If `i` was `1` at the end of the previous iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is a non-zero integer; `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)`; `res` is 0; `i` is 2; `x` and `y` are integers read from the input.** 

If `i` was `0` at the end of the previous iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is a non-zero integer; `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)`; `res` is 0; `i` is 1; `x` and `y` are integers read from the input.** 

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, I will provide the general state assuming `i` was incremented from its previous value:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is a non-zero integer; `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)`; `res` is 0; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `x` and `y` are integers read from the input.** 

For the sake of a concrete example, let's assume `i` was `2` at the end of the previous iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is a non-zero integer; `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)`; `res` is 0; `i` is 3; `x` and `y` are integers read from the input.**
