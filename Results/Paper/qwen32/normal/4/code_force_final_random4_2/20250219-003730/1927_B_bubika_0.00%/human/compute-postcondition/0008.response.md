To determine the output state, let's analyze the code snippet provided in the context of the initial state:

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element
- `r` is an empty string
- `x` is the index of `i` in the list `s`

Code snippet:
```
r += a[x]
```

Here, we notice that the variable `a` is not defined in the initial state. Since `a` is used in the code snippet and not provided, we must assume that `a` is another list or array that is defined elsewhere in the context of the program. However, since `a` is not provided, we can only infer the impact based on the given variables.

Given that `x` is the index of `i` in the list `s`, the value `a[x]` will be some element from the list `a` at the position `x`. Since `r` is initially an empty string, after executing `r += a[x]`, `r` will be updated to the string representation of `a[x]`.

Since the exact contents of `a` are not provided, we cannot determine the specific value that `r` will hold. However, we can state that `r` will be updated to the string representation of the element at index `x` in list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element, `r` is the string representation of `a[x]`, `x` is the index of `i` in the list `s`.**

In natural language: The variable `r` is now the string representation of the element at index `x` in the list `a`. All other variables retain their initial values.
