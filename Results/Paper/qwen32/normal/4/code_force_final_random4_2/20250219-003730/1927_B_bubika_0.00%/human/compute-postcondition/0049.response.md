The given code snippet is `r += a[x]`. This line of code appends the value of `a[x]` to the string `r`. 

Let's break down the impact of this line on the variables:
- `r` is a string that now includes `a[x]` appended to it. So, the new value of `r` will be the previous value of `r` concatenated with `a[x]`.
- `a`, `x`, and `r` are the variables directly involved in the operation. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `b` are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the updated output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 3 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must have at least one element, `b` is a list of integers where each element represents the total count of the corresponding element in `s` and `b[x]` is incremented by 1, `r` is a string that now includes `a[x]` appended to it, `x` is the index of `i` in `b`, `i` is the next element in the list `s`, `a[x]` is appended to `r`.**
