Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly handle the case where the favorite cube's value is equal to the value of the k-th cube after sorting. Specifically, the condition `elif a[k] < x` is correct for determining that the favorite cube will definitely be removed, and `if a[k] > x` is correct for determining that the favorite cube will definitely not be removed. However, the `else` block, which handles the case where `a[k] == x`, is incorrect.

The current `else` block checks if `k == n - 1` or `a[k + 1] < x` to determine if the favorite cube might be removed or not. This is not entirely correct because:

- If `k == n - 1`, it means that the k-th cube is the last cube in the sorted list. In this case, the favorite cube can only be removed if its value is less than or equal to the value of the k-th cube, which is already covered by the `if a[k] > x` condition. Therefore, this condition should not be used here.
- The condition `a[k + 1] < x` is intended to check if there is a cube with a value less than the favorite cube's value right after the k-th cube. If there is, the favorite cube could be in any position between the k-th and (k+1)-th cubes, making it possible for the favorite cube to be removed. However, if `a[k + 1] == x`, the favorite cube could still be removed if it is in a position after the k-th cube but before the (k+1)-th cube. Therefore, the condition should be `a[k + 1] <= x` to correctly handle this case.

The correct `else` block should be:

```python
else:
    print('YES' if a[k + 1] <= x else 'MAYBE')
```

This ensures that if the value of the (k+1)-th cube is less than or equal to the value of the favorite cube, the favorite cube could be removed, and thus the output should be "YES". If the value of the (k+1)-th cube is greater than the value of the favorite cube, the favorite cube will not be removed, and thus the output should be "MAYBE".
