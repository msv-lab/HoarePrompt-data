The value of `x` is updated to be `a[f]`. The previous value of `x` was `a[f + 1]`, but it is now reassigned to `a[f]`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first input integer, `f` is the second input integer minus 1, `k` is the third input integer minus 1, `a` is a new list of integers from the input, `x` is `a[f]`.**
