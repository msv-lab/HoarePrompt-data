The value of `f` is decremented by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is unchanged, `f` is decremented by 1, `k` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged.
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is unchanged, `f` is decremented by 1, `k` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged.**
