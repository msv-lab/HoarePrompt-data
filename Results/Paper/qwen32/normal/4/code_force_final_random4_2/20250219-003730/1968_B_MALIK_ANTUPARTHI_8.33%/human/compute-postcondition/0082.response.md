The code snippet `k = j` assigns the value of `j` to `k`. Given that `j` is initially 4, `k` will also be assigned the value 4. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 4, `b` is the first integer from the user's input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `c` is the second integer from the user's input, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the value of the user's input, `i` is 4, `j` is 4, and `k` is 4. Additionally, the character `d[j]` is not in the substring `e[k:]`.**
