Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 4, `b` is the first integer from the user's input, `c` is the second integer from the user's input, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the value of the user's input, `i` is 4, `j` is the last index processed before the loop breaks, and `k` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(b):
    if d[j] in e[k:]:
        k = e.index(d[j]) + 1
        if k == c or j == b - 1:
            k = j + 1
            break
    else:
        k = j
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 4, `b` is the first integer from the user's input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `c` is the second integer from the user's input, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the value of the user's input, `i` is 4, `j` is 4. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then `k` is the one-based index of the character at `d[4]` in the string `e`. If `k == c` or `j == b - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes occur. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` remains 4 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 4, `b` is the first integer from the user's input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `c` is the second integer from the user's input, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the value of the user's input, `i` is 4, `j` is 5, and `k` is either the index of `d[5]` in `e` plus 1 if `d[5]` is in `e[k:]`, or 5 if `d[5]` is not in `e[k:]`. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 4, `b` is the first integer from the user's input and must be greater than 6, `c` is the second integer from the user's input, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the value of the user's input, `i` is 4, `j` is 6. If `d[6]` is in `e[k:]`, then `k` is updated to the index of `d[6]` in `e` plus 1. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `d[6]` is not in `e[k:]`, `k` is set to 6 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
