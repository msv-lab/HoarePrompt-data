The code snippet `k = e.index(d[j]) + 1` updates the value of `k` based on the index of the character `d[j]` within the string `e`, incremented by 1.

Given the initial state, `k` was 0. After the execution of the code, `k` is updated to the position right after the first occurrence of `d[j]` in `e`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is greater than 0, `c` is the second integer from the user's input, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the value of the user's input, `k` is `e.index(d[j]) + 1`, `i` is 3, and the character `d[j]` is present in the substring `e[k:]`.**
