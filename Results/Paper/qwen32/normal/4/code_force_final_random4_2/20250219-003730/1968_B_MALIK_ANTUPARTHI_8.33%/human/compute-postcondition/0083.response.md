Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 4, `b` is the first integer from the user's input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `c` is the second integer from the user's input, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the value of the user's input, `i` is 4, `j` is 4, and `k` is 4. Additionally, the character `d[j]` is not in the substring `e[k:]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
