The code snippet `k = e.index(d[j]) + 1` assigns to `k` the index of the character at `d[j]` in the string `e`, plus one. Given that `j` is 4, the character at `d[4]` is being sought in `e`. The index returned by `e.index(d[4])` is zero-based, so adding 1 adjusts it to a one-based index.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 4, `b` is the first integer from the user's input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `c` is the second integer from the user's input, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the value of the user's input, `i` is 4, `j` is 4, and `k` is the one-based index of the character at `d[4]` in the string `e`.**
