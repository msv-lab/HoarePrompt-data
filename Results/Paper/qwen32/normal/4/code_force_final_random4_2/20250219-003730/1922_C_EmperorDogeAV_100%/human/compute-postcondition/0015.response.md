To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `cities` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (with `n` being at least 2) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` in ascending order.
- `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` integers where the `i`-th element is `1` if the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`, otherwise the `i`-th element is `abs(forward - cities[i])`.
- `i` is 0 or greater than 0.
- If `i` is greater than 0, `back` is `cities[i - 1]` and `forward` is `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1`, otherwise `forward` is `999999999999999999`.
- If `i` is 0, `back` is `-999999999999999999` and `forward` is `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1`, otherwise `forward` is `999999999999999999`.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has some value, and the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. To start the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will have:
- `i` incremented by 1.
- `n` remains the same.

No other variables in the loop head (`n`) need to be adjusted.

State: **`cities` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (with `n` being at least 2) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` in ascending order; `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` integers where the `i`-th element is `1` if the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`, otherwise the `i`-th element is `abs(forward - cities[i])`; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` remains the same**.
