Precondition: **cities is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: the first element is an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of cities, and the second element is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order. Additionally, there are m queries (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5), each represented as a tuple of two integers (x_i, y_i) (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i) indicating the cities between which the minimum travel cost is to be calculated. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each city, the closest city is uniquely determined.**
