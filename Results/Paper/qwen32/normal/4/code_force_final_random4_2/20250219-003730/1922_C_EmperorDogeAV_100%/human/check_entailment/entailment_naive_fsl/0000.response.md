Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly handle the problem requirements for all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not accurately determine the closest city in all scenarios. The logic for determining the closest city and calculating the prefix sums for the forward and backward paths is flawed.

### Issues in the Code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest City**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the closest city for each city based on the immediate forward and backward neighbors. However, it does not correctly handle cases where the closest city is not the immediate neighbor.
   - For example, consider the cities `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]`. According to the problem description, the closest city to city 1 (at position 0) is city 2 (at position 8). The function `func_1` should return 1 (the cost to travel to the closest city) for city 1, but it returns 8, which is the distance to city 2.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are calculated based on the incorrect values returned by `func_1`. Since the values in `prog_cities` are not correctly representing the cost to travel to the closest city, the prefix sums are also incorrect.
   - This results in incorrect calculations for the minimum number of coins required to travel between any two cities.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the cities are very close together or very far apart. For example, if the cities are `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, the closest city for each city should be the next city, and the cost should be 1. However, the function `func_1` does not handle this correctly.

### Example of Incorrect Output:

Consider the following input:
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

The expected output is:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

However, the program will produce incorrect results due to the issues mentioned above.

### Conclusion:
The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
