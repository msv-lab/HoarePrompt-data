The code snippet `back = cities[i - 1]` updates the value of `back` to be the tuple at index `i - 1` in the `cities` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 before this line, we need to consider the state where `i` has already been incremented. Therefore, `back` will be set to the tuple at the index `i - 1` of the `cities` list.

Output State: **`cities` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (with `n` being at least 2) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` in ascending order; `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` integers where the `i`-th element is `1` if the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`, otherwise the `i`-th element is `abs(forward - cities[i])`; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` remains the same; `back` is `cities[i - 1]`; `forward` is 999999999999999999.**
