Output State: **`cities` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (with `n` being at least 2) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` in ascending order; `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros; `i` is 0 or greater than 0; if `i` is greater than 0, `back` is `cities[i - 1]` and `forward` is `cities[i + 1]`; if `i` is 0, `back` is -999999999999999999 and `forward` is `cities[i + 1]`; the current value of `i` is less than `n - 1`.**

In this output state, the variable `forward` has been updated to the value of `cities[i + 1]`. All other variables retain their previous values as described in the initial state.
