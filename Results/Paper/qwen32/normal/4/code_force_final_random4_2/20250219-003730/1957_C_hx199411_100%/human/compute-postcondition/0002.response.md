The value of `t` is decremented by 1. Given that the initial state specifies `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, after the operation `t -= 1`, the value of `t` will be in the range 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1. The precondition that `t` was initially within the range 1 to 10^4 is now updated to reflect the new range after the decrement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1**.
