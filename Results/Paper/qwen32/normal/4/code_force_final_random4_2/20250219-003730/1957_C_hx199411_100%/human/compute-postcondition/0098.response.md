The code snippet provided increments the value of `num` by 1. Given the initial state, `num` is either 1 or 2 based on whether `c` equals `r` or not. After the operation `num += 1`, if `num` was initially 1, it becomes 2, and if `num` was initially 2, it becomes 3.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is truthy - 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `dp` is a list where the first 9 elements are [0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 331, 1303, 5937] and the rest are zeros if `m` is at least 8, `i` is `i + 1` (where `i` was `k` if `m` equals 1, otherwise `m + 1` at the end of the previous iteration), `c` is the first integer from the new input split, `r` is the second integer from the new input split, `num` is 2 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 3.**
