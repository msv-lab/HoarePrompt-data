The code snippet takes an input string, splits it by spaces, converts the resulting substrings into integers, and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. Therefore, the values of `c` and `r` will be the two integers provided in the input.

Output State: **`c` and `r` are integers obtained from the input, where `c` is the first integer and `r` is the second integer.**
