The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `m`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `m`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `m` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 4. The value of `m` remains the same since it is the upper bound of the loop.

State: **`t` is falsy, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `m` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[i]` which is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `i` is 4**
