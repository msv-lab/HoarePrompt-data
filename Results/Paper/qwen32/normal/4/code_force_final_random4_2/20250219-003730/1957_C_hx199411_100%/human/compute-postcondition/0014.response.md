The code `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. The values of `c`, `r`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged. Since `num` is adjusted based on whether `c` equals `r` before this operation, after the increment, `num` will be one more than its previous value, regardless of the condition involving `c` and `r`. The condition that `k` must be greater than the new value of `i` remains valid and unchanged as well.

Output State: **`c` and `r` are integers obtained from the input, `num` is adjusted based on whether `c` equals `r` plus 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` must be greater than the new value of `i`.**
