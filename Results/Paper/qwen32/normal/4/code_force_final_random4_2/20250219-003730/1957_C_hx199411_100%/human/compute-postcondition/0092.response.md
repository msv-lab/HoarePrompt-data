The code snippet `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. Given that `num` was initially 0, it will now be 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is truthy - 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` must be greater than 0, `dp` is a list where the first 9 elements are [0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 331, 1303, 5937] and the rest are zeros if `m` is at least 8, `i` is `k` if `m` equals 1, otherwise `i` is `m + 1`, `num` is 1, `c` is the first integer from the input split, `r` is the second integer from the input split, and `c` equals `r`.**
