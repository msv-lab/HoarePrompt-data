The code snippet `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. Given the initial state, `num` is either 2 or 4, depending on whether `c` is equal to `r`.

- If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is initially 2, and after the increment, `num` becomes 3.
- If `c` is not equal to `r`, `num` is initially 4, and after the increment, `num` becomes 5.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is truthy and decremented by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` remains 0 if it was 0, remains 1 if it was 1, and is set to 8 if it was greater than 1, `dp` is set to `[0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 331, 1303, 5937]`, `i` is set to 2, `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input, `num` is 3 if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise `num` is 5.**
