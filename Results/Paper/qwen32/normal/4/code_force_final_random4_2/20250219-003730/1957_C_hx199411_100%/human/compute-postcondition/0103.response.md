The code snippet increments the value of `num` by 1. Since `num` was initially set to 2 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` was set to 4, after the increment, `num` will be 3 if it was initially 2, or 5 if it was initially 4. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is truthy - 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `dp` is a list where the first 9 elements are [0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 331, 1303, 5937] and the rest are zeros if `m` is at least 8, `i` is `i + 1`, `c` is the first integer from the new input split, `r` is the second integer from the new input split, and `num` is 3 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 5.**
