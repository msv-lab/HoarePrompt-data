The code snippet `dp[1] = 1` sets the value at index 1 of the list `dp` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is falsy, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `m` is `n - num` and `m` is not equal to 1 (and `m` is not equal to 0), `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `i` is `k`, `num` is the sum of increments based on the comparisons of `c` and `r` in each iteration.**
