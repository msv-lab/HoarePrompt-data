The `while` loop in the provided code is `while t:`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is truthy. Since `t` is described as falsy at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will not execute again unless `t` is changed to a truthy value.

Given the requirement to only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we need to change `t` to a truthy value. No other variables (`n`, `k`, `dp`, `i`, `num`, `m`, `c`, `r`) should be altered because they are not part of the loop head condition.

State: **`t` is truthy, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `dp` is a list where the first 9 elements are [0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 331, 1303, 5937] and the rest are zeros if `m` is at least 8, `i` is `k` if `m` equals 1, otherwise `i` is `m + 1`, and `num` is the sum of increments based on the comparisons of `c` and `r` in each iteration. If `m` equals 0, the function remains in the same state as described. If `m` equals 1, `dp` remains unchanged and `i` is `k`. If `m` is at least 8, `dp` has zeros appended to it starting from the 10th element and `i` is `m + 1`.**
