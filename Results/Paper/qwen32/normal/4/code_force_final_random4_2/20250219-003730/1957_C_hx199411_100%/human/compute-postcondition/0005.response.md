To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(k):`, which means the variables `i` and `k` are relevant.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Variable `k`**:
   - The loop will execute if `k` is greater than 0. If `k` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.
   - The current state does not specify a condition on `k`, so we need to ensure `k` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

2. **Variable `i`**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized by the `range(k)` function in the loop head, so we do not need to set an initial value for `i` before the loop starts. The loop will automatically initialize `i` to 0 on its first iteration.
   - Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `i` before the loop starts.

3. **Other Variables (`t`, `n`, `num`)**:
   - These variables are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. The state of these variables (`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` and `k` are integers as input by the user; `num` is 0) can remain as they are.

Given these considerations, the necessary adjustment is to ensure `k` is greater than 0.

**State:** **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer; `k` must be greater than 0; `num` is 0**
