The code snippet initializes a list `suff` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, or `c`, which retain their initial states.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000; `a` and `b` are lists of integers, each of length `n`, with each element in the range 1 to 10^9; `c` is a list of integers, each of length `n`, where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`, all initialized to 0.**
