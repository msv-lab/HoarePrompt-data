The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, the loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0` in reverse order. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, each of length `n`, with each element in the range 1 to 10^9; `c` is a list of integers, each of length `n`, where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`, where `suff[n - 1]` is equal to `c[n - 1]` and all other elements are 0; `i` is `n - 2`**.
