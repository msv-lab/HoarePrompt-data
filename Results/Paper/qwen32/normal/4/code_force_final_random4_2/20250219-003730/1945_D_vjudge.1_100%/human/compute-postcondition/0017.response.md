Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\).
2. `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\).
3. `a` and `b` are lists of integers, each of length `n`, with each element in the range 1 to \(10^9\).
4. `c` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
5. `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`, where `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[i]` through `c[n-1]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`, and `suff[n]` is `0`.
6. `i` is `k-1`.
7. `ans` is the minimum of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` from `0` to `k-1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Explanation:
- The variable `ans` is defined as the minimum value of the expression `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` from `0` to `k-1`.
- `a[i]` is the element at index `i` in the list `a`.
- `suff[i + 1]` is the sum of the elements in the list `c` from index `i + 1` to `n-1`.

### Calculation of `ans`:
1. For each `i` from `0` to `k-1`, compute `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`.
2. Find the minimum value among all these computed values.

### Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the minimum value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` from `0` to `k-1`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum value of a[i] + suff[i + 1] for all i from 0 to k-1)**
