The code snippet updates the `suff` list at index `i` by setting it to the sum of `suff[i + 1]` and `c[i]`. Given the initial state, `suff[i + 1]` is `suff[n - 1]` which is `c[n - 1]`, and `c[i]` is `c[n - 2]`. Therefore, `suff[i]` (which is `suff[n - 2]`) will be updated to `c[n - 1] + c[n - 2]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, each of length `n`, with each element in the range 1 to 10^9; `c` is a list of integers, each of length `n`, where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`, where `suff[n - 1]` is equal to `c[n - 1]` and `suff[n - 2]` is equal to `c[n - 1] + c[n - 2]`, and all other elements are 0; `i` is `n - 2`**.
