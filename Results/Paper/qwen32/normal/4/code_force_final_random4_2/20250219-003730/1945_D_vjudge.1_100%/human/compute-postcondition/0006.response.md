The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the loop statement `for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1)`, `i` is decremented by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `n - 3`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `suff`) are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, each of length `n`, with each element in the range 1 to 10^9; `c` is a list of integers, each of length `n`, where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`, where `suff[n - 1]` is equal to `c[n - 1]` and `suff[n - 2]` is equal to `c[n - 1] + c[n - 2]`, and all other elements are 0; `i` is `n - 3`**
