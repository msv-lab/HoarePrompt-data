The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`. Therefore, we need to adjust only these variables for the loop to execute one more time.

Given that `i` is currently `0` at the start of the first iteration, before the loop starts, we need to adjust `i` to `1` at the start of the next iteration. The value of `k` remains the same as it determines how many times the loop will run.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n; `a` and `b` are lists of integers, each of length `n`, with each element in the range 1 to 10^9; `c` is a list of integers, each of length `n`, where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`, where `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[i]` through `c[n-1]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`, and `suff[n]` is `0`; `i` is 1; `ans` is the minimum of `a[-1] + suff[0]` and `a[0] + suff[1]`.**
