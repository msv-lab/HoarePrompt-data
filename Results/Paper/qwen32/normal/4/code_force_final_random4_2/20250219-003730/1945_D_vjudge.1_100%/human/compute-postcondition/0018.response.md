Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` and `k` which are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, and `a` and `b` which are lists of integers, each of length `n`, with each element in the range 1 to 10^9. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific output conditions are not detailed here.**
