Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, each of length `n`, with each element in the range 1 to 10^9; `c` is a list of integers, each of length `n`, where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`, where `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[i]` through `c[n-1]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`, and `suff[n]` is `0`; `i` is `-1`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `suff` will contain cumulative sums of the `c` list from the end to the beginning. Specifically, `suff[i]` will hold the sum of all elements from `c[i]` to `c[n-1]` for each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`. The last element of `suff`, `suff[n]`, will remain `0`. The loop variable `i` will be `-1` after the loop has completed all iterations.
