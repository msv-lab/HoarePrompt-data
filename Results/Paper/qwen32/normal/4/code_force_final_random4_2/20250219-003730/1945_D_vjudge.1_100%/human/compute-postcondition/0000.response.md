Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000. `a` and `b` are lists of integers, each of length `n`, with each element in the range 1 to 10^9. `c` is a list of integers, each of length `n`, where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**

In simple terms, the output state is: `n` and `k` remain unchanged. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged. A new list `c` is created where each element is the smaller of the corresponding elements from lists `a` and `b`.
