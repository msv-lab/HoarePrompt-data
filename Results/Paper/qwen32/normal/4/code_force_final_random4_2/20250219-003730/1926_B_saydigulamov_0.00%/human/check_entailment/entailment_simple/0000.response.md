Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a square or a triangle. The program merely counts the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1' and checks if the first two counts are equal. This is insufficient to determine the shape of the figure.

For a square, every row with '1's should have the same number of '1's, and the '1's should be positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid. For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row should follow a specific pattern (1, 3, 5, 7, etc., or its reverse), and the central '1's should be aligned in a single column.

The given program does not implement these checks and instead only checks if the first two counts of '1's are equal, which is not a reliable indicator of the shape. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
