The code attempts to append the count of the digit '1' in the string representation of `b` to the list `k`. Since `b` is an integer greater than 0 and contains the digit '1', `b.count('1')` will count how many times '1' appears in the string representation of `b`. The value of `a` and the fact that `i` is not yet initialized are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, `i` is not yet initialized, `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in the string representation of `b`, `b` is an integer greater than 0 and the string representation of `b` contains the digit '1'.**
