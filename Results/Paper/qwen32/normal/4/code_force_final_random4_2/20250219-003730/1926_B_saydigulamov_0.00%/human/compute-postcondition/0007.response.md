Postcondition: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, `i` is not yet initialized, `k` is a list, and `b` is an integer greater than 0. If the string representation of `b` contains the digit '1', then `k` contains the count of '1's in the string representation of `b`. Otherwise, `k` remains an empty list.**
