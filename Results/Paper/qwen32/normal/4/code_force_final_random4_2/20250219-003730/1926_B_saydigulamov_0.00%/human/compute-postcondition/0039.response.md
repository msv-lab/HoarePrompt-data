The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given the loop `for i in range(a):`, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `a`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. The value of `a` remains unchanged.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:
State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, `i` is 2, and `k` is a list containing the counts of '1's from each of the `a` input strings `b` that contained '1's. If none of the strings contained '1's, `k` is an empty list. Additionally, if `k` is not empty, the first and second elements of `k` are equal.**
