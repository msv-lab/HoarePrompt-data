Postcondition: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, `i` is 1, and `k` is a list containing the counts of '1's from each of the `a` input strings `b` that contained '1's. If none of the strings contained '1's, `k` is an empty list. Additionally, the first and second elements of `k` are equal.**
