Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from input with at least 4 elements, `_` is `k + 1`, `i` is 4, `same` is 3, `minn` is `inf`, and `num` is `ar[3]`.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. All other variables retain their initial values.
