### Reasoning:
The provided program aims to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes a variable `same` to 1, which will count the number of consecutive identical elements. It also initializes `minn` to infinity (`inf`), which will store the minimum count of consecutive identical elements found.

2. **Iterating through the array**: The program iterates through the array starting from the second element. For each element, it checks if it is the same as the previous element (`num`):
   - If it is the same, it increments the `same` counter.
   - If it is not the same, it updates `minn` with the minimum value between `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and updates `num` to the current element.

3. **Final check**: After the loop, the program updates `minn` one last time to account for the last sequence of identical elements. It then checks if `minn` is still infinity or if it equals the length of the array (`len(ar)`):
   - If `minn` is infinity or equals the length of the array, it means all elements were identical or no sequences of identical elements were found, so it outputs `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it outputs `minn`, which represents the minimum number of consecutive identical elements that can be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

### Analysis:
The logic of the program seems correct based on the problem's requirements. It correctly identifies the minimum number of consecutive identical elements that can be removed to break the beauty of the array. If the array is composed of only one type of element or no such sequence exists, it correctly returns `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the given problem according to the provided constraints and examples.

**Correctness: True**
