The given code snippet initializes a variable `same` to 1. The initial state of `t`, `n`, and `ar` remains unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `same` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive, `n` remains the input integer, `ar` remains the list of integers obtained from the input, and `same` is now 1.
