Let's analyze the given Python program against the problem description step by step.

### Problem Recap
We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. A beautiful array is one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\). The program should output -1 if it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `ar`.

2. **Identifying Segments:**
   - The program initializes `same` to 1, indicating the length of the current segment of identical elements.
   - It also initializes `num` to the first element of the array and `minn` to infinity, which will store the minimum size of any segment of identical elements.
   - The program then iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the current element is the same as `num`, it increments `same`.
   - If the current element is different, it updates `minn` to be the minimum of `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and updates `num` to the current element.
   - After the loop, it performs a final check to update `minn` with the last segment length.

3. **Decision Making:**
   - If `minn` remains infinity (which should not happen as it's initialized to the first segment length) or if `minn` equals the length of the array (meaning all elements are the same), the program outputs -1.
   - Otherwise, it outputs `minn`.

### Reasoning

- **Correctness of Identifying Segments:**
  - The program correctly identifies segments of identical elements and tracks the minimum segment length.

- **Correctness of Decision Making:**
  - If all elements are the same (`minn == len(ar)`), the array is already beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements, so outputting -1 is correct.
  - If `minn` is less than the length of the array, removing the entire segment of minimum length would make the array non-beautiful, so outputting `minn` is correct.

### Conclusion

The program appears to correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful or output -1 if it's impossible.

Correctness: **True**
