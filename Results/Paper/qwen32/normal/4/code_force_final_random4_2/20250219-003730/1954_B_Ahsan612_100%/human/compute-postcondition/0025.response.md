To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head condition, which is `i < len(ar)`. 

Here's the breakdown of the relevant variables:
- `i` is the index variable that gets updated based on whether `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.
- `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, so `len(ar)` is at least 2.

Given that `i` is updated to either 3 or 4 depending on whether `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, and `ar` has at least 2 elements, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `len(ar)` after the update.

### Analysis:
1. **Current State**: `i` is either 3 or 4.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: `i < len(ar)`.
3. **Minimum Length of `ar`**: `len(ar) >= 2`.

Since `i` can be either 3 or 4, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `len(ar)` must be greater than the current value of `i`. Therefore, if `i` is 3, `len(ar)` must be at least 4, and if `i` is 4, `len(ar)` must be at least 5.

### Conclusion:
To guarantee that the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `len(ar)` is at least 5. This will cover both cases where `i` is 3 or 4.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 5 elements, `minn` is 1, `same` is 3 if `ar[2]` is equal to `num` and 2 otherwise, and `i` is updated to 3 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num` and 4 otherwise**.
