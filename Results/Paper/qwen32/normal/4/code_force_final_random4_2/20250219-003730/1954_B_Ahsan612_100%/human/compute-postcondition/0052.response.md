The code snippet `num = ar[i]` assigns the value of `ar[i]` to `num`. Given that `i` is 2, `num` will now hold the value of the third element in the list `ar` (since list indices start at 0).

Here's the updated state of the variables:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `ar` remains a list of integers with at least two elements.
- `i` remains 2.
- `same` remains 1.
- `num` is now the value of `ar[2]`.
- `minn` remains infinity.
- `ar[i]` is not equal to `num` remains unchanged as a condition but is no longer directly relevant to the current state update.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is 2, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[2]`, `minn` is infinity.**
