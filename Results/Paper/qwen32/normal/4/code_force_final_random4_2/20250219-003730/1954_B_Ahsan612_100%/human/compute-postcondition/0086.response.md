The code snippet provided sets `i` to 1. This only affects the variable `i`, and all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from input, `i` is 1, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[0]`, `minn` is `inf`, and `_` is `k + 1`.**
