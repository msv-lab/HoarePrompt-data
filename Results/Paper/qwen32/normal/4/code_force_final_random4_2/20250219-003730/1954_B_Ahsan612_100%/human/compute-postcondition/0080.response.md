The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times based on the input. The loop will execute `int(input())` times, and the state of `_` does not affect the other variables in the program.

Given the loop:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop control variable `_` is incremented automatically by 1 after each iteration. The state of `_` does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `same`, `num`, or `minn`. Therefore, we only need to consider the state of `_` for the next iteration.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `_` is some integer value, let's call it `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` should be `k + 1`.

Since the other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `same`, `num`, `minn`) are not part of the loop head and are not affected by the loop control variable `_`, their states remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(ar)`, `same` is the count of the last sequence of identical elements, `num` is the last unique element encountered in the list, and `minn` is the minimum count of any sequence of identical elements encountered in the list, updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `same`. If `minn` was initially `inf` or equal to `len(ar)`, it retains its value; otherwise, `minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`. `_` is `k + 1`**
