Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is either 3 or 4, `num` is `ar[3]` if `i` is 3, or `ar[4]` if `i` is 4, `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and `same`.**

Explanation: The variable `minn` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. Other variables remain unchanged.
