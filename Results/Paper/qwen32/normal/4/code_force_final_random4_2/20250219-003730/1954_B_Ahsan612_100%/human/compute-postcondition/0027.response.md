The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is either 3 or 4 based on the condition `ar[i] == num`. Therefore, after the increment, `i` will be either 4 or 5. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 5 elements, `minn` is 1, `same` is 3 if `ar[2]` is equal to `num` and 2 otherwise, and `i` is either 4 or 5**.
