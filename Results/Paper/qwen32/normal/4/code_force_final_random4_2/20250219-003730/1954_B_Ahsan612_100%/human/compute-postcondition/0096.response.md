Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from input with at least 2 elements, `_` is `k + 1`. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 2, `same` is 2, and `minn` is `inf`. Otherwise, `i` is 3, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[2]`, and `minn` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` was 1 or 2 depending on the condition. After the increment, `i` becomes 2 or 3 respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.
