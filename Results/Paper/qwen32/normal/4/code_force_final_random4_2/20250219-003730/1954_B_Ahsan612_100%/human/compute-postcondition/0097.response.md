The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than the length of the list `ar`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 3.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than the length of `ar`. Since `ar` has at least 2 elements, the smallest possible length for `ar` is 2. However, since `i` is currently 3, `ar` must have at least 4 elements to ensure that `i` (which is 3) is still less than the length of `ar`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the length of `ar` to be at least 4.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from input with at least 4 elements, `_` is `k + 1`. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 2, `same` is 2, and `minn` is `inf`. Otherwise, `i` is 3, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[2]`, and `minn` is 1**
