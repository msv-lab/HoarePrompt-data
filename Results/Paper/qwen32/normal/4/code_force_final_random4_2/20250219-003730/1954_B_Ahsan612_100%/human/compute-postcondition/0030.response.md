Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 5 elements, `minn` is 1, `same` is 1, and `i` is either 4 or 5; `num` is `ar[4]` if `i` is 4, or `ar[5]` if `i` is 5.**

In this output state, the value of `same` has been updated to 1, while all other variables retain their initial values.
