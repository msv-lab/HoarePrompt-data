The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual string elements, converts each of these string elements to an integer, and then stores the resulting list of integers in the variable `ar`. This operation overwrites the previous value of `ar`.

Given the initial state, all other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `same`, `num`, `minn`, and `_`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from input, `i` is `len(ar)`, `same` is the count of the last sequence of identical elements, `num` is the last unique element encountered in the list, and `minn` is the minimum count of any sequence of identical elements encountered in the list, updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `same`. If `minn` was initially `inf` or equal to `len(ar)`, it retains its value; otherwise, `minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`. `_` is `k + 1`.**
