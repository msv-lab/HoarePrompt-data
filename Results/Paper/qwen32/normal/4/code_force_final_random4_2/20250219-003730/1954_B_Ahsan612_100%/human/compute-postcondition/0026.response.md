The code snippet provided increments the value of the variable `same` by 1. 

Given:
- `same` is initially 3 if `ar[2]` is equal to `num` and 2 otherwise.
- `same += 1` will increase the value of `same` by 1.

Therefore:
- If `same` was 3, it will now be 4.
- If `same` was 2, it will now be 3.

No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 5 elements, `minn` is 1, `same` is 4 if `ar[2]` is equal to `num` and 3 otherwise, and `i` is updated to 3 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num` and 4 otherwise.**
