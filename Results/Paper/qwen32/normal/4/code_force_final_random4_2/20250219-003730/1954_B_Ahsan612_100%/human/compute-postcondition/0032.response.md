The code snippet `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` can either be 3, 4, or 5. After the increment, `i` will be 4, 5, or 6 respectively. 

Let's break it down:
- If `i` was 3, it becomes 4.
- If `i` was 4, it becomes 5.
- If `i` was 5, it becomes 6.

The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `minn`, `num`, and `same` remain unchanged. The only change is in the value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 5 elements, and `minn` is 1. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, `same` is 4 if `ar[2]` is equal to `num` and 3 otherwise, and `i` is 4. If `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, `same` is 1, and `i` is either 5 or 6; `num` is `ar[4]` if `i` is 4, or `ar[5]` if `i` is 5.**
