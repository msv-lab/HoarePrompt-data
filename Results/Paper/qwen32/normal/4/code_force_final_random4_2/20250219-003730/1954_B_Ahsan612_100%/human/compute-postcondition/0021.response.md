The code snippet `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. Given that `minn` is initially 1 and `same` is either 1 or 2, the minimum value between them will be 1. Therefore, `minn` remains 1.

The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `num`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 3, `same` is 2 if `ar[2]` is equal to `num` and 1 otherwise, `num` is `ar[3]`, `minn` is 1**
