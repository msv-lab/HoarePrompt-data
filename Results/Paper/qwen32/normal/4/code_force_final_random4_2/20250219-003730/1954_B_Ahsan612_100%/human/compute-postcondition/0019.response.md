Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 3, `same` is 2 if `ar[2]` is equal to `num` and 1 otherwise, `num` is `ar[2]` if `ar[i-1]` was equal to `num`, `minn` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions.
