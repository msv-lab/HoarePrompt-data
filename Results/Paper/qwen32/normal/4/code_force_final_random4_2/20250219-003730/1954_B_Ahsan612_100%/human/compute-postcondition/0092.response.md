The code snippet `num = ar[i]` updates the value of the variable `num` to be the value of the element at index `i` in the list `ar`. Given that `i` is initially 2, `num` will now hold the value of `ar[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from input with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[2]`, `minn` is `inf`, and `_` is `k + 1`.**
