The `print(-1)` statement in the given code snippet is independent of the variables `t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `same`, `minn`, and `num`. The `print` function directly outputs the value `-1` as specified.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
1. The initial state provides us with the definitions and constraints of several variables.
2. However, the `print(-1)` statement does not utilize any of these variables.
3. The value `-1` is explicitly provided within the `print` function.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `-1`.

Output: **-1**
