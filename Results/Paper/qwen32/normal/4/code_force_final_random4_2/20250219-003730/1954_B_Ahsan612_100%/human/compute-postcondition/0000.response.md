In the provided task, the for loop is controlled by the range of `int(input())`, which means the loop will execute based on the integer value read from the input. This integer represents the number of test cases, denoted by `t` in the state description.

Let's analyze the loop head and the necessary state adjustments:

1. **Loop Head Analysis**:
   - The loop is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. 
   - The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state.
   - The number of iterations is determined by `int(input())`, which is the integer `t` representing the number of test cases.

2. **State Adjustments**:
   - The state before the loop should ensure that `int(input())` will return a value that allows the loop to execute the required number of times, which is `t`.
   - Since `t` is already given as an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, we need to make sure that the input function will return this `t` value.
   - The state should reflect that `t` is the number of iterations for the loop.

Given the above analysis, the state should be adjusted to reflect that `t` is the integer input that determines the number of iterations of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `int(input())` returns `t`**.
