Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `s` is a string provided by the user input and has at least 2 characters, `i` is `len(s) - 2`, `q` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. If `int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1])`, then `flag` is 1. If `int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1])`, then `count` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged and `flag` remains 0.**
