The code provided is:

```python
t = int(input())
```

This line of code reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is already an integer within the range 1 to 500. However, the code reassigns `t` to the value provided by the input, which means the new value of `t` will be the integer input by the user. The string `s` and its properties remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input by the user, and `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.**
