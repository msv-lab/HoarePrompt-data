Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a string `s` consisting of '0's and '1's. It then calculates and prints the number of transitions between different characters in the string `s`. If there are no transitions where a '0' is followed by a '1', it increments the count by 1. This process is repeated for all `t` test cases.**
