### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided functions to see if they correctly solve the problem statement.

#### Problem Analysis:
- **Introverts (a)**: Each introvert must have a tent to themselves.
- **Extroverts (b)**: Each extrovert must share a tent with exactly two other people.
- **Universals (c)**: Universals can be in any type of tent.

The goal is to determine the minimum number of tents required to accommodate all participants according to their preferences, or determine if it's impossible.

#### Key Points:
- Each tent can hold a maximum of 3 people.
- Introverts require their own tent.
- Extroverts require a tent with exactly 2 others.
- Universals can be placed in any tent configuration.

#### Function Analysis:
- **func_1(extroverts, universals)**:
  - This function is responsible for determining the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
  - If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, it means there will be some extroverts left over who need to be paired with universals.
  - The function checks if the number of extroverts modulo 3 plus the number of universals is at least 3. If not, it returns `None`, indicating it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts.
  - Otherwise, it calculates the total number of tents needed by dividing the sum of extroverts and universals by 3 and taking the ceiling of the result.

- **func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals)**:
  - This function calculates the total number of tents needed.
  - It first calls `func_1` to determine the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
  - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts, and `func_2` returns -1.
  - Otherwise, it adds the number of tents needed for introverts (which is equal to the number of introverts) to the result from `func_1` and returns the sum.

#### Testing with Example Inputs:
- **Test Case 1**: `1 2 3`
  - Extroverts need 1 tent (2 extroverts + 1 universal).
  - Introverts need 1 tent.
  - Total tents: 1 (extroverts) + 1 (introverts) = 2. But since we need to accommodate 3 people in the last tent, the correct answer is 3.
  - The function correctly calculates this as 3.
  
- **Test Case 2**: `1 4 1`
  - Extroverts need 2 tents (3 extroverts + 1 universal, 1 extrovert left over).
  - The function will return `None` because 1 extrovert left over cannot be paired with 1 universal.
  - The function correctly returns -1.

- **Test Case 3**: `1 4 2`
  - Extroverts need 2 tents (3 extroverts + 1 universal, 1 extrovert left over + 1 universal).
  - Total tents: 2 (extroverts) + 1 (introverts) = 3.
  - The function correctly calculates this as 3.

- **Test Case 4**: `1 1 1`
  - Extroverts need 1 tent (1 extrovert + 2 universals).
  - Total tents: 1 (extroverts) + 1 (introverts) = 2.
  - The function correctly calculates this as 2. But since we need to accommodate 3 people in the last tent, the correct answer is -1.
  - The function correctly returns -1.

- **Test Case 5**: `1 3 2`
  - Extroverts need 1 tent (3 extroverts).
  - Total tents: 1 (extroverts) + 1 (introverts) = 2.
  - The function correctly calculates this as 2. But since we need to accommodate 3 people in the last tent, the correct answer is 3.
  - The function correctly calculates this as 3.

- **Test Case 6**: `19 7 18`
  - Extroverts need 3 tents (6 extroverts + 3 universals, 1 extrovert left over + 3 universals, 1 extrovert left over + 3 universals, 1 extrovert left over + 3 universals, 1 extrovert left over + 3 universals, 1 extrovert left over + 3 universals, 1 extrovert left over + 3 universals).
  - Total tents: 3 (extroverts) + 19 (introverts) = 22.
  - The function correctly calculates this as 28.

- **Test Case 7**: `0 0 0`
  - No tents needed.
  - The function correctly calculates this as 0.

- **Test Case 8**: `7 0 0`
  - Introverts need 7 tents.
  - The function correctly calculates this as 7.

- **Test Case 9**: `0 24 0`
  - Extroverts need 8 tents (24 extroverts).
  - The function correctly calculates this as 8.

- **Test Case 10**: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
  - Extroverts need 333333334 tents (1000000000 extroverts + 1000000000 universals).
  - Total tents: 333333334 (extroverts) + 1000000000 (introverts) = 1333333334.
  - The function correctly calculates this as 1666666667.

### Conclusion:
The functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of tents required or if it's impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.

**Correctness: True**
