You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program:
from math import ceil
from typing import Optional
#Function 1:
def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if extroverts % 3 != 0:
        if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3:
            return None
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)

#Function 2:
def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function takes three non-negative integer parameters representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. It returns the sum of the number of introverts and the result of another function call (`func_1(extroverts, universals)`). If the result of `func_1` is `None`, the function returns -1.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Introverts (a)**: Each introvert wants to live alone, so they require one tent each.
2. **Extroverts (b)**: Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with exactly two others, meaning each group of 3 extroverts requires one tent.
3. **Universals (c)**: Universals can live alone, with one other person, or with two others. They are flexible but are needed to fill incomplete groups of extroverts to make groups of 3.

### Key Points
- **Introverts**: Always require `a` tents.
- **Extroverts**: Require `b / 3` tents, but if `b % 3 != 0`, we need to check if universals can fill the remaining spots.
- **Universals**: Used to fill incomplete groups of extroverts.

### Conditions for Impossibility
- If there are leftover extroverts after forming groups of 3 and no universals are available to fill the remaining spots, it is impossible to accommodate everyone.

### Steps to Solve
1. Calculate the number of tents required for introverts: `a`
2. Calculate how many complete groups of extroverts can be formed: `b // 3`
3. Check the remaining extroverts: `b % 3`
   - If `b % 3 == 0`, no additional tents are needed for extroverts.
   - If `b % 3 != 0`, we need universals to fill the remaining spots.
     - If `b % 3 + c < 3`, it is impossible to form a valid group, return `-1`.
     - Otherwise, calculate the number of additional tents needed for the remaining extroverts and universals.
4. Sum the tents for introverts and the calculated tents for extroverts and universals to get the total number of tents.

### Analysis of the Provided Program

The program consists of two functions:
- `func_1`: Calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals, considering the leftover extroverts.
- `func_2`: Uses `func_1` to determine the total number of tents needed for introverts, extroverts, and universals.

#### Function Analysis

**Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
- Checks if the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3.
- If it is not, checks if the sum of leftover extroverts and universals is less than 3. If true, it returns `None` (indicating impossibility).
- Otherwise, it calculates the number of tents needed using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

**Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
- Calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
- If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns `-1` (indicating impossibility).
- Otherwise, it returns the sum of introverts and the tents calculated by `func_1`.

### Correctness Check

- **Test Case 1**: `a = 1, b = 2, c = 3`
  - Introverts: 1 tent
  - Extroverts: 2 extroverts need 1 tent with 1 universal.
  - Total tents: 1 + 1 = 2
  - The program calculates 3 tents (1 for introvert, 2 for extroverts and universals).
  - This is correct.

- **Test Case 2**: `a = 1, b = 4, c = 1`
  - Introverts: 1 tent
  - Extroverts: 4 extroverts need 1 tent with 1 universal and 1 tent with 1 extrovert and 2 universals.
  - There is 1 extrovert left without a group of 3 and not enough universals to form a valid group.
  - The program returns `-1`.
  - This is correct.

- **Test Case 3**: `a = 1, b = 4, c = 2`
  - Introverts: 1 tent
  - Extroverts: 4 extroverts need 1 tent with 1 universal and 1 tent with 2 universals.
  - Total tents: 1 + 2 = 3
  - The program calculates 3 tents.
  - This is correct.

- **Test Case 4**: `a = 1, b = 1, c = 1`
  - Introverts: 1 tent
  - Extroverts: 1 extrovert needs 1 tent with 2 universals.
  - There is 1 universal left without a group of 3.
  - The program returns `-1`.
  - This is correct.

- **Test Case 5**: `a = 1, b = 3, c = 2`
  - Introverts: 1 tent
  - Extroverts: 3 extroverts need 1 tent.
  - Total tents: 1 + 1 = 2
  - The program calculates 3 tents.
  - This is correct.

- **Test Case 6**: `a = 19, b = 7, c = 18`
  - Introverts: 19 tents
  - Extroverts: 7 extroverts need 2 tents with 2 universals and 1 tent with 1 extrovert and 2 universals.
  - Total tents: 19 + 3 = 22
  - The program calculates 28 tents.
  - This is incorrect.

- **Test Case 7**: `a = 0, b = 0, c = 0`
  - Introverts: 0 tents
  - Extroverts: 0 tents
  - Total tents: 0
  - The program calculates 0 tents.
  - This is correct.

- **Test Case 8**: `a = 7, b = 0, c = 0`
  - Introverts: 7 tents
  - Extroverts: 0 tents
  - Total tents: 7
  - The program calculates 7 tents.
  - This is correct.

- **Test Case 9**: `a = 0, b = 24, c = 0`
  - Introverts: 0 tents
  - Extroverts: 24 extroverts need 8 tents.
  - Total tents: 8
  - The program calculates 8 tents.
  - This is correct.

- **Test Case 10**: `a = 1000000000, b = 1000000000, c = 1000000000`
  - Introverts: 1000000000 tents
  - Extroverts: 1000000000 extroverts need 333333333 tents with 1 universal and 1 tent with 1 extrovert and 2 universals.
  - Total tents: 1000000000 + 333333334 = 1333333334
  - The program calculates 1666666667 tents.
  - This is incorrect.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of tents in all test cases. Specifically, it overestimates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals in some cases.
