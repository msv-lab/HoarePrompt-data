You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program:
from math import ceil
from typing import Optional
#Function 1:
def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if extroverts % 3 != 0:
        if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3:
            return None
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)

#Function 2:
def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function takes three non-negative integer parameters representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. It returns the sum of the number of introverts and the result of another function call (`func_1(extroverts, universals)`). If the result of `func_1` is `None`, the function returns -1.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code fails to account for scenarios where the number of universals is insufficient to pair with extroverts to meet their requirement of being in a tent with two others.

Let's analyze the code:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if the number of extroverts can be perfectly grouped into tents of three. If not, it checks if the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals to complete a tent.
   - However, the logic `if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3` is incorrect. It should check if the remaining extroverts can be paired with enough universals to complete the tents. For example, if `extroverts % 3 == 1` and `universals == 1`, it should still be possible to form a tent with the remaining extrovert and the universal.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calls `func_1` and adds the number of introverts to the result. If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns `-1`.

### Example Case Where the Code Fails:
Consider the input `a=0`, `b=1`, `c=1`:
- According to the problem statement, one extrovert and one universal can share a tent, so the expected output is `1`.
- However, `func_1(1, 1)` will return `None` because `1 % 3 + 1 < 3` is `False`, and thus `func_2(0, 1, 1)` will return `-1`, which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
- The code should ensure that the number of extroverts can be paired with enough universals to form complete tents of three.
- Additionally, it should handle cases where the number of universals is not sufficient to pair with extroverts, resulting in an impossible scenario.

### Corrected Code Example:
```python
from math import ceil

def min_tents(a, b, c):
    # Tents for introverts
    tents = a
    
    # Tents for extroverts
    extroverts_left = b
    while extroverts_left > 0:
        if extroverts_left >= 3:
            tents += 1
            extroverts_left -= 3
        elif extroverts_left == 2:
            if c >= 1:
                tents += 1
                extroverts_left -= 2
                c -= 1
            else:
                return -1
        elif extroverts_left == 1:
            if c >= 2:
                tents += 1
                extroverts_left -= 1
                c -= 2
            else:
                return -1
    
    # Tents for remaining universals
    tents += ceil(c / 3)
    
    return tents

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    t = int(input[0])
    idx = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        a = int(input[idx])
        b = int(input[idx + 1])
        c = int(input[idx + 2])
        idx += 3
        results.append(min_tents(a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected code properly handles all edge cases and ensures that the number of tents is calculated correctly according to the problem statement.
