The program could raise an exception at any point within the `try` block where an operation might fail. Specifically, the `int(a[g])` and `int(a[d])` conversions could raise a `ValueError` if `a[g]` or `a[d]` are not valid integers. Additionally, accessing `a[g]` or `a[d]` could raise an `IndexError` if `g` or `d` are out of bounds for the list `a`.

If no exceptions occur, the `try` block will successfully:
1. Decrement the value at index `g` in list `a` by 1.
2. Decrement the value at index `d` in list `a` by 1.
3. Increment `g` by 1 if the value at `a[g]` becomes 0.
4. Decrement `d` by 1 if the value at `a[d]` becomes 0.

However, if an exception occurs, the `except` block will execute, and the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Combining these scenarios, the final output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `k` remains the same. If no exceptions occur, `a[g]` is `int(a[g]) - 1` and `a[d]` is `int(a[d]) - 1`. If `a[g]` was originally 0, `g` is incremented by 1. If `a[d]` was originally 0, `d` is decremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
