The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'10'`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state (`t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, `k`). The string `'10'` is explicitly provided in the `print` function.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `z`, `a`), but none of these are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'10'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'10'`.

Output: **10**
