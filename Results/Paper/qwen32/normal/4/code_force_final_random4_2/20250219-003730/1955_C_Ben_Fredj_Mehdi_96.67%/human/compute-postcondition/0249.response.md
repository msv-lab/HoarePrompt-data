In the provided `try` block, exceptions could occur during the execution of the lines `a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1` and `a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1`. These lines attempt to access elements of the list `a` at indices `g` and `d`, convert them to integers, and then decrement them. If `g` or `d` is out of bounds for the list `a`, or if the elements at these indices cannot be converted to integers, an exception will be raised.

The `try` block also includes checks to see if the decremented values at indices `g` and `d` are zero. If they are, `g` is incremented by 1 and `d` is decremented by 1, respectively.

If no exceptions occur, the state of the program after the `try` block is:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `z` remains 2.
- The element at index `g` in list `a` is decremented by 1.
- The element at index `d` in list `a` is decremented by 1.
- If the element at index `g` in list `a` becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1.
- If the element at index `d` in list `a` becomes 0, `d` is decremented by 1.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `k` remains the same.

If an exception occurs, the `except` block is executed, which breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the state of the program becomes unknown.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `z` is 2, `a` is a list with the element at index `g` decremented by 1, the element at index `d` of `a` decremented by 1, `g` is incremented by 1 if `a[g]` was 0, `d` is decremented by 1 if `a[d]` was 0, `i` is `i + 1`, and `k` remains the same. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the state is unknown.**
