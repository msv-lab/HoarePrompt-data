Let's analyze the given task step-by-step based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `z` is set to 2.
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the user's input string split by spaces.
- `n` and `k` are no longer relevant in their previous form.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('2')
```

The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'2'`. The values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k` do not affect this output because the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables. 

Therefore, the output will be exactly the string `'2'`.

Output: **2**
