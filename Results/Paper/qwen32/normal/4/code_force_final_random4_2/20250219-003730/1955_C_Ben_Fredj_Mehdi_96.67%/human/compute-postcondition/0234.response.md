Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers derived from the user's input string split by spaces with the first element decremented by 1 and the last element decremented by 1, `d` is `len(a) - 1`, `g` is 1, and the current value of `a[g]` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `g` is incremented by 1, so `g` changes from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
