Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `z` is 1; `a` is a list of integers where `a[g]` is now `a[g] - 2` from its original value; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the start up to the first space character; `k` is an integer value of at least 2; `d` is `len(a) - 2` if `a[d]` was not 0, or `len(a) - 3` if `a[d]` was 0; `a[d]` is now `a[d] - 1` from its previous value; if `a[g]` is 0, then `g` is incremented by 1; if an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; `i` is incremented by 1 if no exception occurs; if `a[g]` was 0, `g` is incremented by 1 again.**
