The code snippet `a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1` modifies the value at index `g` in the list `a` by subtracting 1 from its integer value. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `k` remains the same, `a[g]` is `int(a[g]) - 1`.**
This means that the value at index `g` in the list `a` has been decremented by 1, while `i` and `k` retain their initial values.
