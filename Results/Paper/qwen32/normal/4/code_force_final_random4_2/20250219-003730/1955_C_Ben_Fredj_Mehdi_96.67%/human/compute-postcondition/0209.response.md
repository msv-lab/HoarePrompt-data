Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's analyze what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. 
   - This variable represents the number of test cases or iterations, but it is not used in the print statement.
2. `z` is set to the integer value 2.
   - This variable is defined but not used in the print statement.
3. `a` is a list of integers derived from the user's input string split by spaces.
   - This list is defined but not used in the print statement.
4. `n` and `k` are no longer relevant in their previous form.
   - These variables are mentioned as no longer relevant, so they do not affect the print statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'1'`. None of the variables `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, or `k` are referenced in this print statement. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'1'`.

### Output:
Output: **1**
