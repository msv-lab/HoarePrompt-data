The given `print` statement is `print('2')`. This statement directly prints the string `'2'` to the output. The value to be printed is explicitly provided within the `print` function and does not depend on the values of any variables or objects defined in the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'2'`.

Output: **2**
