The code snippet `a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1` modifies the value of `a[d]` by decrementing it by 1. The initial state specifies that `i` is `i + 1`, `k` remains the same, and `a[g]` is `int(a[g]) - 1`. Since the code only affects `a[d]`, the values of `i`, `k`, and `a[g]` remain unchanged.

The output state is:
Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `k` remains the same, `a[g]` is `int(a[g]) - 1`, `a[d]` is `int(a[d]) - 1`.**
