Given the initial state and the code snippet, we need to determine what will be printed by the `print` statement.

The initial state describes several variables and their values or origins:
- `t` is an integer input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `z` is set to 2.
- `a` is a list of integers derived from a user's input string split by spaces.
- `n` and `k` are no longer relevant in their previous form.

However, the `print` statement is:
```python
print('9')
```

This statement explicitly prints the string `'9'` and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, or `k`.

Therefore, the output is simply the string `'9'`.

Output: **9**
