Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input with the first element and the last element each decreased by 1, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the start up to the first space character, `k` is an integer value of at least 2, `d` is the length of `a` minus 1, `g` is 1, and `a[g]` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `g` is incremented by 1, so it changes from 0 to 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
