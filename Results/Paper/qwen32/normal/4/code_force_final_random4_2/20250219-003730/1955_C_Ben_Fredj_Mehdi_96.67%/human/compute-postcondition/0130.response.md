Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `z` is set to 1.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input.
- `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the start up to the first space character.
- `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the first space character to the end.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing the string `'1'`.
- The value of `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k` do not affect the output of this `print` statement since it is explicitly printing the string `'1'`.

### Output:
Output: **1**
