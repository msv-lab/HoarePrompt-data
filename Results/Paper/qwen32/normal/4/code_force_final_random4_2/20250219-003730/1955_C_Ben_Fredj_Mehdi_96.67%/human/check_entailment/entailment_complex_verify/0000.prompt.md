You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #State: The loop has processed all `t` test cases, and the final output state reflects the state of the last test case processed, with `t` indicating the total number of test cases, `n` and `k` being the values from the last test case, and `a` being the list of integers from the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it prints a specific value based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the elements in `a`. The printed value is determined by a series of conditional checks and a final calculation if none of the conditions are met.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program includes hardcoded values for specific test cases, which is not a correct approach for a general solution. The program should correctly handle any input values within the given constraints without relying on hardcoded results.

Here is a potential case where the program does not work as expected:

**Input:**
```
1
4 6
1 2 4 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of the expected output:**
1. Kraken attacks the first ship, durability becomes zero, a = [2, 4, 3]
2. Kraken attacks the last ship, a = [2, 4, 2]
3. Kraken attacks the first ship, a = [1, 4, 2]
4. Kraken attacks the last ship, a = [1, 4, 1]
5. Kraken attacks the first ship, a = [0, 4, 1]
6. Kraken attacks the last ship, a = [0, 4, 0]

So, 3 ships are sunk.

**Program Output:**
The program will output `3` for this case because it does not match any of the hardcoded conditions, and it correctly processes this case. However, the program's reliance on hardcoded values for other cases means it is not a general solution.

**Another Incorrect Case:**
Let's consider a different input where the program might fail due to hardcoded values:

**Input:**
```
1
5 20
2 7 1 8 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
5
```

**Explanation of the expected output:**
The Kraken will attack the ships in the following order, reducing their durability until they sink. Since the total number of attacks (20) is greater than the sum of the ships' durabilities (20), all ships will sink.

**Program Output:**
The program will output `5` for this case because `k >= sum(a)` is true, but the hardcoded values might not cover all possible cases, and the general logic should handle all cases without relying on hardcoded values.

Given the above analysis, the program is not correct because it relies on hardcoded values for specific test cases, which is not a valid approach for a general solution. Therefore, the correctness is False.
