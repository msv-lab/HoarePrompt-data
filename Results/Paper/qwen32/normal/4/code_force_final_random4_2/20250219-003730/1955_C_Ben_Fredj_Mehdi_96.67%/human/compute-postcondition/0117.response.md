Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space, `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space. If `k` is equal to 9999999999, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `n` is 101 and `k` is 100000000000, or `k` is 10000000000000, the state of the variables remains the same. If `k` is 99999999999999, the current value of `k` is 99999999999999, and it is not the case that `n` is 1 and `a[0]` is 1, or `n` is 101. If `k` does not equal 99999999999999, the state of the variables remains the same unless `k` equals 199999999999999, 1000000000000, 200000000000, 2147483648 (with specific `n` values), 5999999999, 4294967295, 3000000000, or `k` is equal to `a[0] - 1` and `a[1] - 2` (with `n` being 2), or if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in `a`. If `k` is less than the sum of the elements in `a`, the first `k // 2` and last `k // 2` non-zero elements of `a` are decremented by 1, with the specific value at `a[g]` being decremented by 1 if `k` is odd. `n` and `k` remain unchanged in these cases. `k` is not equal to 9999999999, 1999999998, 1999999999, 100000000000, or 10000000000000.**
