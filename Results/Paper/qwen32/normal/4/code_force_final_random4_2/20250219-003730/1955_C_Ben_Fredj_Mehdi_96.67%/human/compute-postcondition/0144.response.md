In the given task, the initial state describes several variables (`t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, `k`) and their origins, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('0')
```

This `print` statement is explicitly printing the string `'0'`. The values of the variables `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k` do not influence the output of this `print` statement because the statement is hardcoded to print the string `'0'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply:

Output: **0**
