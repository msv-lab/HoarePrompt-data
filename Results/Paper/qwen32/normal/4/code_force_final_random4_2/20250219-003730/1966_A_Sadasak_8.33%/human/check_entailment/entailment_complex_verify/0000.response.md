### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies several critical issues with the provided program. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Frequency Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to limit the frequency of each card to `k`. This is incorrect because the problem requires counting the actual frequency of each card and then determining how many operations can be performed based on that frequency.
   - By capping the frequency to `k`, the function loses the actual count of each card, which is necessary to calculate the number of operations accurately.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cards Calculation:**
   - The main logic of the program does not correctly compute the minimum number of cards based on the operations described. The program checks if `k` is in the frequency values, which is not a valid way to determine the minimum number of cards.
   - The correct approach involves counting the frequency of each card, determining how many operations can be performed (i.e., how many groups of `k` cards can be formed), and then calculating the remaining cards after performing all possible operations.

3. **Test Case Analysis:**
   - The provided test case in the original assessment demonstrates the incorrect behavior of the program. The program fails to correctly reduce the number of cards based on the operations described.

### Correct Approach

The corrected version of the code provided in the original assessment correctly handles the frequency of card numbers and computes the minimum number of cards after performing the operations:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    from collections import Counter
    freq = Counter(nums)
    
    min_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        min_cards += count % k + (count // k if count % k != 0 else 0)
    
    print(min_cards)
```

- **Counting Frequencies:** The `Counter` from the `collections` module is used to count the frequency of each card number.
- **Calculating Remaining Cards:** For each unique card number, the program calculates the number of operations that can be performed (`count // k`) and adds the remainder (`count % k`) to the total number of remaining cards (`min_cards`).

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the provided program. The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of cards after performing the described operations. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
