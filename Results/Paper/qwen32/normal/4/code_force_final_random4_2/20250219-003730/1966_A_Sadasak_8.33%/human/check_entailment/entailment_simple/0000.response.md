### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step by step to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to minimize the number of cards in the hand by repeatedly exchanging `k` cards of the same number for `k-1` cards of any number. The strategy involves reducing the counts of the most frequent numbers as much as possible.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code reads the input, handles different cases based on the relationship between `n` and `k`, and then calls a function `func_1` to compute a frequency table. However, the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem as described.

##### Issues with the Code:
1. **Frequency Table Calculation**: The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the frequency of each number in the list but caps the frequency at `k`. This is incorrect for the problem because we need the actual frequency of each number, not capped at `k`.
   
2. **Logic for Minimum Cards**: The main logic after the function call is flawed:
   - If `k` is in the frequency table values, it prints `k-1`. This condition is not relevant to finding the minimum number of cards left.
   - If `k` is not in the frequency table values, it prints `n`. This is also incorrect because it doesn't consider the actual reduction of cards based on the operations allowed.

#### Correct Approach:
1. **Calculate Actual Frequencies**: We need to calculate the actual frequency of each number in the list.
2. **Reduce Cards Based on Operations**: For each unique number, reduce the count by `k-1` as many times as possible (i.e., divide the frequency by `k` and take the ceiling of the result).
3. **Sum the Remaining Cards**: The sum of these reduced counts will give the minimum number of cards left.

#### Correct Implementation:
Here is a correct implementation of the problem:

```python
import math

def min_cards(n, k, nums):
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    min_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        min_cards += math.ceil(count / (k - 1))
    
    return min_cards

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(min_cards(n, k, nums))
```

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**
