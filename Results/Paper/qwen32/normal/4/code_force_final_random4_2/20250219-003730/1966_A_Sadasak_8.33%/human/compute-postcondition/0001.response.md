The only object in the loop head is the variable `num` and the list `arr`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If the list has at least one integer, the loop will execute. The variable `num` will take the value of the first element in the list `arr` during the first iteration.

Given that the loop body is omitted, the state of `k` and `frequency_table` does not affect the execution of the loop itself, so we only need to ensure that `arr` has at least one integer.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards that must have at least 1 integer, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, and `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary**
