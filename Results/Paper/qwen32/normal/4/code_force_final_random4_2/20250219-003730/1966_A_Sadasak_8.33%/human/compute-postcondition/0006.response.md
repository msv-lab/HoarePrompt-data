The only variable in the loop head is `num`, which is being iterated over from the list `arr`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `num` and how it relates to the list `arr`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` was the last element that was processed. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `arr` that has not yet been processed.

Given that `arr` must have at least one integer, and assuming that the previous iteration processed the first element, the next value of `num` should be the second element in `arr`. If the previous iteration processed the second element, then `num` should be the third element, and so on.

Since we are not given the specific elements of `arr` or the current position of `num`, we can only generalize that `num` should be the next element in the list `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards that must have at least 1 integer, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, and `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key. If `frequency_table[num]` was greater than `k`, it is now exactly `k`. Otherwise, `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged. `num` is the next element in `arr`.**
