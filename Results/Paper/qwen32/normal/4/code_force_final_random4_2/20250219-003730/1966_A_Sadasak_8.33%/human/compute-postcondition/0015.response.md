Output State: **The program returns the `frequency_table` dictionary, where each key is a unique number from the list `arr` and its value is the minimum of the count of that number in `arr` and `k`.**

This means the dictionary will have keys corresponding to each unique integer in the list `arr`, and each value will be the lesser of how many times that integer appears in `arr` or the value of `k`.
