Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect logic for determining the minimum number of cards**:
   - The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of cards that can be left after performing the allowed operations.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to help in calculating the frequency of each card, but it incorrectly caps the frequency at `k`, which is not the correct approach for solving the problem.

2. **Handling the frequency of cards**:
   - The problem requires us to repeatedly reduce groups of `k` cards with the same number to `k-1` cards. This means that for each unique card number, we should determine how many full groups of `k` cards can be formed and reduce the count accordingly.
   - The current implementation of `func_1` does not perform this reduction and instead just caps the frequency at `k`.

3. **Incorrect conditions for printing the result**:
   - The conditions in the main loop do not correctly determine the minimum number of cards. For example, if `k > n`, the program correctly prints `n`, but the other conditions are not correctly handling the logic for reducing the number of cards.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Calculate the frequency of each card number
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in nums:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    remaining_cards = 0
    
    # For each unique card number, reduce the number of cards by the maximum possible
    for freq in frequency_table.values():
        remaining_cards += freq % k
    
    # If no cards are left after the reduction, we must have at least one card left
    if remaining_cards == 0:
        remaining_cards = k
    
    print(remaining_cards)
```

This corrected version calculates the frequency of each card number, then reduces the count of cards by the maximum possible for each unique number, and finally ensures that at least one card is left if all cards can be perfectly reduced.
