The code updates the `frequency_table` dictionary by incrementing the count of the `num` key by 1, unless the current count is already `k`, in which case it remains `k`. 

Given the initial state, `frequency_table[num]` could either be less than `k` (in which case it will be incremented by 1) or exactly `k` (in which case it will remain unchanged).

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards that must have at least 2 integers, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key. If `frequency_table[num]` was greater than `k`, it is now exactly `k`. Otherwise, `frequency_table[num]` is incremented by 1, `num` is the next element in `arr`. The value of `frequency_table[num]` is either `frequency_table[num] + 1` if it was less than `k`, or `k` if it was `k` or greater.**

In simpler terms, the count of `num` in `frequency_table` is increased by 1, but it will not exceed `k`.
