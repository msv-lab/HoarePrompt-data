The only variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If there are more elements in `arr`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` was the last element processed from `arr`.

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `arr` to be processed. Therefore, `num` should be the next element in `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards that must have at least 2 integers, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key. If `frequency_table[num]` was greater than `k`, it is now exactly `k`. Otherwise, `frequency_table[num]` is incremented by 1, `num` is the next element in `arr`**.
