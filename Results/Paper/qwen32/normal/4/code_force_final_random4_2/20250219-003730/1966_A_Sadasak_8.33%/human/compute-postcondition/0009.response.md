Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards that must have at least 1 integer, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key. If `frequency_table[num]` was greater than `k`, it is now exactly `k`. Otherwise, `frequency_table[num]` is incremented by 1, `num` is the next element in `arr`.**
