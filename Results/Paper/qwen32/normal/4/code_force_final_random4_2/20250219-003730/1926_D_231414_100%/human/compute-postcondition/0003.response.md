Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `times` must be greater than or equal to 1, `check` is 2147483647, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `n` will take the integer value provided by the user input. The other variables (`t`, `times`, and `check`) remain unchanged.
