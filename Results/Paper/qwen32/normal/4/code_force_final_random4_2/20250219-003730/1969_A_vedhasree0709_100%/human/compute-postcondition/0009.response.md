The `print(2)` statement in the given Python code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. The number 2 is explicitly provided as the argument to the `print` function.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `j`, `p`, `q`) and their relationships.
2. However, the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables. It simply prints the integer `2`.

Therefore, the output will be the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
