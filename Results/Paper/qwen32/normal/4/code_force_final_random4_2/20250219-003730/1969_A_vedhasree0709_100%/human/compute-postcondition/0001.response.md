Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer.**

The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is still an integer greater than or equal to 1.
