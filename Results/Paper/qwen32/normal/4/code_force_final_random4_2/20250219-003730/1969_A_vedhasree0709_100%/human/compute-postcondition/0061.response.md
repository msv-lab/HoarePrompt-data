Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` must be greater than 2; `l` is a new list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 2; `j` is 1; `p` is `l[2]`; `q` is `l[l[2] - 1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
