To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop are complete, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop terminates and how the variables are modified during each iteration.

The loop runs while `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`. In each iteration, the loop checks if the value of `q` (which is `l[p - 1]` where `p = l[i]`) is equal to `i + 1`. If this condition is met, it prints `2`, sets `j` to `1`, and breaks out of the loop. If the condition is not met, it increments `i` by `1` and continues to the next iteration.

Given the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer the following:
- After 1 iteration, `i` is `1`, `p` is `l[0]`, and `q` is `l[l[0] - 1]`.
- After 2 iterations, `i` is `2`, `p` is `l[1]`, and `q` is `l[l[1] - 1]`.
- After 3 iterations, `i` is `3`, `p` is `l[2]`, and `q` is `l[l[2] - 1]`.

The loop will continue until `i` exceeds `n - 1` or the condition `q == i + 1` is met. If the condition `q == i + 1` is never met, the loop will terminate when `i` becomes `n`.

Thus, the final output state will be:
- `i` will be `n` if the condition `q == i + 1` is never met.
- `j` will be `1` if the condition `q == i + 1` is met at any point during the loop, otherwise it will remain `0`.
- The values of `t` and `l` will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a new list of integers derived from the input; `i` is `n`; `j` is 1 if `q` equals `i + 1` at any iteration, otherwise `j` is 0.**

In simpler terms, the loop will run until it either finds a pair `(i, q)` where `q` equals `i + 1` (in which case `j` becomes `1` and the loop breaks) or until `i` reaches `n` (in which case `j` remains `0` if no such pair was found).
