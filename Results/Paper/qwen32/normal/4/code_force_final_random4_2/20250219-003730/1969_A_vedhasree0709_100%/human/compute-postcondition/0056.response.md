To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. The loop condition is `i <= n - 1`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` and `n` are adjusted such that `i` is still less than or equal to `n - 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `l` is a new list of integers derived from the input.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 1 if `q` equals `i + 1`, otherwise `j` remains 0.
- `p` is `l[1]`.
- `q` is `l[l[1] - 1]`.

The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`. Since `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2 to satisfy the condition `2 <= n - 1`.

No other states need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head condition.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` must be greater than 2; `l` is a new list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 2; `j` is 1 if `q` equals `i + 1`, otherwise `j` remains 0; `p` is `l[1]`; `q` is `l[l[1] - 1]`**
