Postcondition: **`t` remains unchanged and is still an integer such that `t >= 1`. `n` remains unchanged as the input integer. `l` remains unchanged as the new list of integers derived from the input. `i` will be `n` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking. `j` is 0, indicating that `q == i + 1` was never met at any point during the loop.**
