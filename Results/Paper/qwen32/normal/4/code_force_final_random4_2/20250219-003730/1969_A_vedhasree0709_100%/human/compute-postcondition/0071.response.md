The value of `i` is set to 0, while the values of `t`, `n`, `l`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a new list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 0; `j` is 0 if `q` equals `i + 1` has not occurred at any iteration.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a new list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 0; `j` is 0 if `q` equals `i + 1` has not occurred at any iteration.**
