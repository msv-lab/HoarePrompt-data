The code snippet increments the value of `i` by 1. Therefore, the value of `i` changes from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is at least 2; `l` is a new list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 2; `p` is `l[1]`; `q` is `l[p - 1]`. If `q` equals `i + 1`, then `j` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.**
