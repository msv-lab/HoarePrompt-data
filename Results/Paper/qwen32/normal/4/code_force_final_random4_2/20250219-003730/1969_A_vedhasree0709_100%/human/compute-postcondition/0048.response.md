To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head condition. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i <= n - 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `l` is a new list of integers derived from the input.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 1 if `q` equals `i + 1`, otherwise `j` remains 0.
- `p` is `l[0]`.
- `q` is `l[p - 1]`.

The loop condition is `i <= n - 1`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`.

Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 2 (so that `n - 1` is at least 1, and thus `i <= n - 1` holds true).

No other variables in the loop head (`i` and `n`) need to be adjusted beyond ensuring that `i <= n - 1` is true.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 2; `l` is a new list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 1; `j` is 1 if `q` equals `i + 1`, otherwise `j` remains 0; `p` is `l[0]`; `q` is `l[p - 1]`.**
