The loop condition for the given `while` loop is `i <= n - 1`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `i` and `n` such that the condition `i <= n - 1` remains true.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is an integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `l` is a list of integers derived from the input.
- `i` is 2.
- `p` is the element at index 1 in the list `l`.
- `q` is the element at index `p - 1` in the list `l`.

Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than or equal to `n - 1`. This means `n - 1` must be at least 2, or equivalently, `n` must be at least 3.

No other states need to be adjusted because the loop condition only involves `i` and `n`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 3; `l` is a list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 2; `p` is the element at index 1 in the list `l`; `q` is the element at index `p - 1` in the list `l`.**
