To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `i <= n - 1`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `l` is a new list of integers derived from the input.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 0.

The loop condition is `i <= n - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, this condition must be true when `i` is 0. So, we need to ensure that `0 <= n - 1` is true.

This simplifies to `n >= 1`.

Since `n` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The other variables (`t`, `l`, and `j`) are not part of the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a new list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 0; `j` is 0.**
