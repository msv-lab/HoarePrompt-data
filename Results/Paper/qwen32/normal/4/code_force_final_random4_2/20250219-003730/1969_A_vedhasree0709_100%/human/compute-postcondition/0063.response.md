Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is greater than 2; `l` is a new list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 3; `p` is `l[2]`; `q` is `l[l[2] - 1]`. If `q` equals `i + 1`, then `j` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.**

Natural Language: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so `i` is now 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
