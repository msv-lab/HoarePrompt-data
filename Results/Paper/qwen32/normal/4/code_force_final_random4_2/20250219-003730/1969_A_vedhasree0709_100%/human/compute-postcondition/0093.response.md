The `print` statement in the given code snippet is `print(2)`. This statement will output the integer value `2` regardless of the values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `p`, `q`) because the `print` function is explicitly given the integer `2` as its argument.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print(2)`.
2. The argument to the `print` function is the integer `2`.
3. The value `2` is a constant and does not depend on any other variables or conditions in the program.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is `2`.

Output: **2**
