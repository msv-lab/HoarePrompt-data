To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head: `2 ** i <= x`.

### Analysis:
- **Variables in the loop head**: `i` and `x`.
- **Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `2 ** i` is less than or equal to `x`.

### Current State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000 (This is not relevant to the loop condition, so we can ignore it for this task).
- For each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18 (This is also not relevant to the loop condition, so we can ignore it for this task).
- `x` is a non-zero integer and `x` must be at least 1.
- `subseq_lens` is an empty list (This is not relevant to the loop condition, so we can ignore it for this task).
- `mx` is 0 unless the else part is executed, in which case `mx` is updated to the maximum value between its previous value and `i - 1` (This is not relevant to the loop condition, so we can ignore it for this task).
- `i` is 1.

### Goal:
We need to ensure that `2 ** i <= x` is true for the next iteration of the loop.

### Steps:
1. **Current `i` is 1**: We need to check if `2 ** 1 <= x` is true. This simplifies to `2 <= x`.
2. **Adjust `x` if necessary**: If `x` is less than 2, we need to adjust `x` to be at least 2.
3. **Adjust `i` if necessary**: Since `i` starts at 1 and we are checking if the loop can execute one more time, `i` does not need to be adjusted unless we are considering a scenario where `i` has already been incremented in the loop body, which is not specified here. For the next iteration, we assume `i` remains 1 or has been incremented properly in the loop body.

### Conclusion:
- `x` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time.
- `i` is already 1, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is at least 2, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0 unless the else part is executed, in which case `mx` is updated to the maximum value between its previous value and `i - 1`, `i` is 1**. 

However, since only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, the final state considering only relevant variables is:

State: **`x` must be at least 2, `i` is 1**
