To determine what will be printed by the `print(ansv[i], end=' ')` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. **t**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This variable is not directly used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for the current task.

2. **X**: An integer such that \(2 \leq X \leq 10^{18}\). This is the starting point for calculating the powers of 2 that will be used to form the `subseq_lens` list.

3. **x**: Initialized to 0. This variable is not directly used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for the current task.

4. **subseq_lens**: A list of integers representing the powers of 2 subtracted from `X` in descending order. This list is constructed by repeatedly subtracting the largest possible power of 2 from `X` until `X` becomes 0.

5. **mx**: The maximum integer in `subseq_lens`. Since `subseq_lens` contains powers of 2 in descending order, `mx` is the first element of `subseq_lens`.

6. **ansv**: A list of integers constructed as follows:
   - It starts with integers from 0 to `mx - 1`.
   - It is then followed by all elements of `subseq_lens` from the second element to the last element.

7. **i**: An integer that is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is not provided explicitly, but it is used to index into the `ansv` list.

Given this information, the output of the `print(ansv[i], end=' ')` statement will depend on the current value of `i`.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Constructing `subseq_lens`**:
   - `subseq_lens` is constructed by finding the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `X` and subtracting it from `X`. This process is repeated until `X` becomes 0.
   - For example, if `X = 13`, the powers of 2 that can be subtracted in descending order are 8, 4, and 1. So, `subseq_lens` would be `[8, 4, 1]`.

2. **Determining `mx`**:
   - `mx` is the maximum integer in `subseq_lens`, which is the first element of `subseq_lens`.
   - Using the previous example where `subseq_lens = [8, 4, 1]`, `mx` would be 8.

3. **Constructing `ansv`**:
   - `ansv` starts with integers from 0 to `mx - 1`. For `mx = 8`, this would be `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.
   - It is then followed by all elements of `subseq_lens` from the second element to the last element. For `subseq_lens = [8, 4, 1]`, this would be `[4, 1]`.
   - Therefore, `ansv` would be `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 4, 1]`.

4. **Determining the Output**:
   - The value printed by `print(ansv[i], end=' ')` will be the element at index `i` in the `ansv` list.
   - Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we can describe the output in terms of `i`.

### Final Output Description:

The `print(ansv[i], end=' ')` statement will print the element at index `i` of the `ansv` list, which is constructed as described above. The exact value printed will depend on the current value of `i`.

Output: **ansv[i] (where ansv is constructed as described above and i is the current index)**
