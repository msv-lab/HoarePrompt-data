The value of `x` is updated by subtracting `2 ** (i - 1)` from its previous value. The values of `t`, `X`, `subseq_lens`, `mx`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet provided. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is a non-zero integer updated to `x - 2 ** (i - 1)`, `subseq_lens` is a list containing `i - 1`, `mx` is 0 unless the else part is executed, in which case `mx` is updated to the maximum value between its previous value and `i - 1`, and `i` is not equal to 0.**
