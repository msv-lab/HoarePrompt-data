Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the construction of the array to achieve exactly X increasing subsequences. There are several issues with the logic used in the program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of X**: The program attempts to decompose X into powers of 2, but this approach does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly X increasing subsequences. The decomposition into powers of 2 is not a direct translation to the number of increasing subsequences.

2. **Array Construction**: The array construction using the subsequence lengths does not ensure that the resulting array has exactly X increasing subsequences. The way the array is constructed and the values appended do not guarantee the correct number of increasing subsequences.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, when X is a large number that cannot be represented by a combination of powers of 2 in a way that fits the problem constraints, the program may not return the correct answer or may not handle it appropriately.

4. **Output Format**: The output format is not strictly adhered to in all cases. The program should print `-1` if it is impossible to find such an array, but the current logic does not properly handle this condition.

To illustrate the issue, consider the case where X is a large number like `13`. The program might not correctly construct an array that has exactly 13 increasing subsequences. The current logic does not ensure that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly X for all possible values of X.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not meet the requirements for every potential case and does not guarantee the correct number of increasing subsequences for all values of X.
