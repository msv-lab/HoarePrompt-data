Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is an input integer that is not equal to 2; `subseq_lens` is an empty list; `mx` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while x != 0:
    i = 0
    while 2 ** i <= x:
        i += 1
    if i == 0:
        break
    else:
        subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
        x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
        mx = max(mx, i - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18. `x` is an input integer that is not equal to 0, unless the else part is executed, in which case `x` is decreased by 2. `subseq_lens` is an empty list. `mx` is 0 unless the else part is executed, in which case `mx` is updated to the maximum value between its previous value and `i - 1`. `i` is the smallest integer such that 2, and if the if part is executed, it remains 0. If the else part is executed, the value of `i` is unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is a non-zero integer, `subseq_lens` is an empty list. If `i` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is updated to `x - 2` and `mx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `i - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is at least 4 minus 2^59, `subseq_lens` is either an empty list or contains the value 59, `i` is either 0 or 60, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` was 0, `subseq_lens` remains an empty list and `i` becomes 0. If `i` was 60, `subseq_lens` contains the value 59, `x` is at least 4 minus 2^59, `i` remains 60, and `mx` is at least 59.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
