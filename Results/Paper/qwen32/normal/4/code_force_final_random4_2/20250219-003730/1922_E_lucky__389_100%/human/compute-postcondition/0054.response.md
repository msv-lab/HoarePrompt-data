The code snippet `mx = max(mx, i - 1)` updates the value of `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`. Given that `i` is 60, `i - 1` equals 59. Therefore, `mx` will be updated to 59 if its current value is less than 59. If `mx` is already 59 or greater, it will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is at least 4 minus 2^59, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value 59, `i` is 60, `mx` is at least 59, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
