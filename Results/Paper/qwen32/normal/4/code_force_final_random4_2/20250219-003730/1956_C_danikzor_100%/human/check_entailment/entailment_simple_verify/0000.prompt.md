You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for t in range(t, 0, -1):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for t in range(t, 0, -1):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the n×n matrix filled with zeroes. The number of test cases t is between 1 and 500, and the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
    #This is printed: n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n (where n is the size of the n×n matrix)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        
        print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        
    #State: The output will consist of `2 * n` lines, where each pair of lines corresponds to an iteration of `i` from 1 to `n`. The first line of each pair is `1, i, n, n-1, ..., 1` and the second line is `2, i, n, n-1, ..., 1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program outputs a specific sequence of operations for each test case without considering whether those operations are optimal to achieve the maximum sum. Specifically, the program uses the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]` for both row and column operations, but this is not necessarily the optimal permutation for maximizing the sum.

To maximize the sum of the matrix, the optimal strategy is to fill the matrix with the numbers from 1 to n in such a way that each number from 1 to n appears exactly n times (once in each row and once in each column). One way to achieve this is to fill the matrix in a way that each row and each column is a permutation of the numbers from 1 to n. The simplest such permutation is the identity permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

Here is a counterexample to show that the provided program is not correct:

**Input:**
```
1
2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
7 3
1 1 1 2
1 2 1 2
2 1 1 2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
The maximum sum for a 2x2 matrix is 7, which can be achieved by setting the matrix as:
```
1 2
2 1
```
This can be done with the following operations:
1. `1 1 1 2` (Set the first row to [1, 2])
2. `1 2 1 2` (Set the second row to [1, 2])
3. `2 1 1 2` (Set the first column to [1, 2])

**Program Output:**
```
7 3
1 1 2 1
1 2 2 1
2 1 2 1
2 2 2 1
```

**Explanation of Program Output:**
The program sets the matrix as:
```
2 1
2 1
```
This results in a sum of 6, which is not the maximum possible sum.

Thus, the program does not always produce the correct maximum sum for all possible input cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
