Let's analyze the provided program and its correctness based on the problem description and the annotated execution states.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Maximize the sum of all elements in an `n x n` matrix `a` filled with zeroes.
2. **Operations**:
   - **Type 1**: Choose a row `i` and assign values from a permutation `p` to the elements of that row.
   - **Type 2**: Choose a column `i` and assign values from a permutation `p` to the elements of that column.
3. **Constraints**: No more than `2n` operations should be used.
4. **Output**: The maximum sum of the matrix and the sequence of operations to achieve this sum.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of the following steps:
1. **Input Handling**: It reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.
2. **Output Calculation**:
   - It calculates the maximum sum of the matrix as `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`.
   - It states that `2 * n` operations will be used.
3. **Operation Generation**:
   - It generates `2 * n` operations: for each row `i` from `1` to `n`, it performs a Type 1 operation and a Type 2 operation, both using the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.

### Verification:
To verify the correctness, we need to:
1. **Check the Formula**: Ensure that the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` correctly calculates the maximum sum.
2. **Check the Operations**:
   - **Type 1 Operation**: Assigning the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]` to each row ensures that each row has the maximum possible sum.
   - **Type 2 Operation**: Assigning the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]` to each column ensures that each column has the maximum possible sum.
   - **Overlap Handling**: Since each element of the matrix is assigned a value twice (once from the row operation and once from the column operation), we need to ensure that this does not result in an incorrect sum. The maximum value for each element is `n`, and since each element is assigned `n` twice, the sum formula accounts for this by considering the overlap correctly.

### Formula Derivation:
The formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` can be derived as follows:
- Each element in the matrix is assigned the value `n` twice (once from the row and once from the column).
- The sum of the first `n` natural numbers is `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
- Each row and column contributes to the sum in such a way that the total sum is `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and generates the required operations within the constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
