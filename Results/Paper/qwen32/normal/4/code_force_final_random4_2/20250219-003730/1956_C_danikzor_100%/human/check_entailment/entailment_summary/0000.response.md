### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

**Problem Analysis:**

1. **Objective:** Maximize the sum of all numbers in an `n x n` matrix by performing Type 1 and Type 2 operations.
2. **Constraints:** 
   - Type 1: Assign a row `i` with a permutation `p`.
   - Type 2: Assign a column `i` with a permutation `p`.
   - Maximum operations allowed: `2n`.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - To maximize the sum, each cell should ideally contain the largest possible number.
   - Since each row and column can be independently permuted, the optimal strategy is to assign each row and each column with the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`. This ensures that all cells in the matrix are filled with the largest possible values.

4. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The sum of the first `n` natural numbers is `n * (n + 1) / 2`.
   - Each row and column will be filled with the values `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`, and since there are `n` rows and `n` columns, each number from `1` to `n` will appear `n` times in the matrix.
   - Therefore, the total sum is `n * (n * (n + 1) / 2) = n^2 * (n + 1) / 2`.
   - However, each cell is counted twice (once in its row and once in its column), so the correct formula for the sum is `n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) / 6 + n * (n + 1) / 2 = n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) / 6`.

**Program Analysis:**

The program correctly calculates the maximum sum using the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) / 6` and prints `2 * n` operations, each consisting of filling a row and a column with the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`. 

**Execution Summary:**

- The program reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, calculates the maximum sum, and prints it.
- It then prints `2 * n` operations: for each `i` from `1` to `n`, it performs:
  - Type 1 operation on row `i` with permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.
  - Type 2 operation on column `i` with permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.

The operations described ensure that each row and column is filled with the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`, maximizing the sum of the matrix.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the optimal strategy to maximize the sum of the matrix with no more than `2n` operations.

**Correctness: **True**
