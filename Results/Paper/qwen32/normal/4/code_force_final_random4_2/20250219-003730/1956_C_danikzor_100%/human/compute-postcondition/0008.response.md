The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the loop, `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Thus, `i` should be 3 for the loop to execute again. The variable `n` does not need to be adjusted as it defines the upper limit of the range.

State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 500`, `i` is 3**
