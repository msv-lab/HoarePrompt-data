Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 500`
- `i` is 2

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Value of `2`**: The first argument in the `print` statement is the integer `2`.
2. **Value of `i`**: The second argument is the variable `i`, which is given as `2`.
3. **`range(n, 0, -1)`**: This generates a sequence of numbers starting from `n` down to `1` (inclusive). The `*` operator unpacks this sequence so that each number in the sequence is printed as a separate argument.

### Determining the Output:
- The first two numbers printed will be `2` and `2` (from the values of the first two arguments).
- The third part of the `print` statement is the unpacked range `range(n, 0, -1)`. This means:
  - If `n` is `5`, the range will be `5, 4, 3, 2, 1`.
  - If `n` is `1`, the range will be `1`.
  - For any value of `n` between `1` and `500`, the range will be a sequence of numbers starting from `n` down to `1`.

### General Output:
- The output will start with `2 2`, followed by the numbers from `n` down to `1`.

### Final Output:
Since `n` is not explicitly defined in the problem statement, we describe the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **2 2 n n-1 n-2 ... 1 (where n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500)**
