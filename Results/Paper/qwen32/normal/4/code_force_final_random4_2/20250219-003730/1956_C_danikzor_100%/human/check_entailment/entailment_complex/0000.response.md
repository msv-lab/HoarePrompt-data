### Reasoning:

The problem requires maximizing the sum of all the numbers in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations. Each operation can either fill a row or a column with a permutation of the numbers from 1 to \( n \).

The provided program calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix and outputs the sequence of operations that achieve this sum. The maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{n \times (n + 1) \times (4n - 1)}{6} \]

This formula is derived from the fact that each row and each column can be filled with the permutation \([n, n-1, \ldots, 1]\) to maximize the sum. 

The program performs \( 2n \) operations:
- For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs a Type 1 operation to fill the row with \([n, n-1, \ldots, 1]\).
- For each column \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs a Type 2 operation to fill the column with \([n, n-1, \ldots, 1]\).

However, this approach is incorrect because the operations are not independent. If a row is filled with \([n, n-1, \ldots, 1]\) and then a column is filled with the same permutation, the overlap of these operations will not necessarily maximize the sum. The correct approach is to fill each row and each column with a permutation that maximizes the sum without conflicting with each other.

The correct way to maximize the sum is to fill the matrix with the permutation \([n, n-1, \ldots, 1]\) in a way that avoids conflicts. One correct approach is to fill the matrix diagonally, but the provided solution does not do this.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the provided program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix because it does not handle the overlap of row and column operations correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
