Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a single integer representing the size of an `n×n` matrix filled with zeroes.
- The value of `n` is between 1 and 500.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
```

### Explanation:
1. **First Part of the Print Statement:**
   - The expression `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` calculates a specific value based on the input `n`.
   - This formula is known to compute the sum of squares of the first `n` natural numbers.
   - The formula is derived from the mathematical identity: 
     \[
     \sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6}
     \]
     However, the given formula is slightly different, specifically:
     \[
     \frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}
     \]
     This formula calculates a different value, but for the context of this problem, we'll use it as given.

2. **Second Part of the Print Statement:**
   - The expression `2 * n` simply multiplies the integer `n` by 2.

### Output:
- The code will print two values separated by a space.
- The first value is the result of the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`.
- The second value is `2 * n`.

### Final Output Format:
Output: **n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n (where n is the size of the n×n matrix)**

This output format precisely describes the values that will be printed based on the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.
