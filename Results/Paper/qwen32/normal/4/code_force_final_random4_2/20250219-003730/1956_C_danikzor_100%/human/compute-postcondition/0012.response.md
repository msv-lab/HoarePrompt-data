Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It returns a list of n×n matrices, each filled with zeroes, for each test case where n is an integer between 1 and 500. The number of test cases t is between 1 and 500, and the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5.**
