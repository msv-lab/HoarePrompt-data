The code snippet `q = int(data[index + 1])` updates the value of `q` by converting the string at the position `index + 1` in the `data` list to an integer.

Given the initial state:
- `data` is a list of strings containing the split input values.
- `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1.
- `index` is `n + 3 + 2*q`.
- `n` is `int(data[n + 3])`.
- `q` is 0.
- `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[i + 2])` for `i` from 1 to `n`.
- `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`.
- `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list and `mp[pf[i]]` is a list of indices `j` such that `pf[j]` equals `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`.
- `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries.

After the code snippet executes, the value of `q` is updated to the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. Note that the value of `index` itself depends on the initial value of `q`, which is 0. Therefore, `index` is `n + 3`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing the split input values; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1; `index` is `n + 3`; `n` is `int(data[n + 3])`; `q` is `int(data[n + 4])`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[i + 2])` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list and `mp[pf[i]]` is a list of indices `j` such that `pf[j]` equals `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries.**
