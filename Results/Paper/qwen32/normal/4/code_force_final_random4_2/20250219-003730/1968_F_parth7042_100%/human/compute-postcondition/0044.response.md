Postcondition: **`data` is a list of strings containing the split input values where the first element can be converted to an integer greater than 0; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0; `index` is `n + 5`; `results` is a list containing the string 'YES' if `x` equals 0, otherwise `results` remains an empty list; `n` is the integer value of the second element in `data`; `q` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[i + 2])` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `mp` is a `defaultdict` with a default factory of list and `mp[pf[i]]` is a list of indices `j` such that `pf[j]` equals `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `l` is `int(data[n + 3])`; `r` is `int(data[n + 4])`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it1` is the position where `l` would be inserted into `v1` to maintain sorted order; `it2` is the position where `r` would be inserted into `v2` to maintain sorted order, minus 1. Additionally, either `it1` is not less than the length of `v1`, or `it2` is less than 0, or `v1[it1]` is not less than `v2[it2]`.**
