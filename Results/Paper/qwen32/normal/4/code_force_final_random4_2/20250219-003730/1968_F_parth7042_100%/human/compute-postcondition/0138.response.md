Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing at least `2n + 5` elements; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1; `index` is `2n + 11`; `n` is `int(data[n + 3])`; `q` is an integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except the first `n` elements which are `int(data[n + 5])` to `int(data[2n + 4])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except the first `n` elements which are the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list and `mp[pf[i]]` contains `[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries with an additional 'YES' if `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, otherwise it includes an additional 'NO'; `l` is `int(data[2n + 9])`; `r` is `int(data[2n + 10])`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it1` is the index of the first element in `v1` that is not less than `l` (found using `bisect_left`); `it2` is the index of the largest element in `v2` that is less than or equal to `r`.** 

In simple terms, the only change is that the variable `index` has been incremented by 2, making its new value `2n + 11`. All other variables retain their previous values and states.
