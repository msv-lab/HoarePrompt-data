The code increments the `index` variable by 2. Therefore, `index` will now be 3. The other variables (`data`, `t`, `results`, `n`, and `q`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing the split input values where the first element can be converted to an integer greater than 0; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0; `index` is 3; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of the second element in `data`; `q` is the integer value of the third element in `data`.**
