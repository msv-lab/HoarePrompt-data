Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `data` is a list of strings containing the split input values; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`; `index` is 1; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    q = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    a = [0] * (n + 1)
    pf = [0] * (n + 1)
    mp = defaultdict(list)
    mp[0].append(0)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        a[i] = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
        mp[pf[i]].append(i)
    for _ in range(q):
        l = int(data[index])
        r = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
        if x == 0:
            results.append('YES')
            continue
        v1 = mp[pf[r]]
        v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
        it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
        it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
        if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: data is a list of strings containing the split input values where the first element can be converted to an integer greater than 0; t is the integer value of the first element in data and must be greater than 0; index is n + 3 + 2*q; n is the integer value of the second element in data; q is 0; a is a list of n + 1 zeros except a[i] which is int(data[i + 2]) for i from 1 to n; pf is a list of n + 1 zeros except pf[i] which is the cumulative XOR of a[1] to a[i] for i from 1 to n; mp is a defaultdict with a default factory of list and mp[pf[i]] is a list of indices j such that pf[j] equals pf[i] for i from 1 to n; results is a list containing the results of all q queries.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: data is a list of strings containing at least 2n + 5 elements; t is the integer value of the first element in data minus 1; index is 2n + 5 + 2*q; n is int(data[n + 3]); q is an integer representing the number of queries; a is a list of n + 1 zeros except the first n elements which are int(data[n + 5]) to int(data[2n + 4]); pf is a list of n + 1 zeros except the first n elements which are the cumulative XOR of the elements in a up to that point; mp is a defaultdict with a default factory of list and mp[pf[i]] contains [i] for each i from 1 to n; results is a list containing the results of all q queries, with each result being 'YES' if it1 < len(v1), it2 >= 0, and v1[it1] < v2[it2], otherwise 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `data` is a list of strings containing at least `2n + 5` elements, `data[index - 2]` is a string representing an integer value greater than or equal to 1, `n` is `int(data[index - 2])`, `q` is `0`, `index` is `2n + 5 + 2*q + 2 + n + 4 + 2*(q-1) + 2`, `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 2, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[i]` is `int(data[index - (n + 1) + i])` for `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list, `mp[0]` contains the value `[0]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` contains all indices `i` for which `pf[i]` is the same, `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries plus `'YES'` or `'NO'` based on the condition `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] < v2[it2])` for each query.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
