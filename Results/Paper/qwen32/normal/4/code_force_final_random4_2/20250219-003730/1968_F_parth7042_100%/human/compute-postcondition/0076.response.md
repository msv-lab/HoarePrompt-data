Postcondition: **`data` is a list of strings containing the split input values; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0; `index` is `n + 9`; `n` is the integer value of the second element in `data`; `q` is one less than its current value and must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[i + 2])` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `mp` is a `defaultdict` with a default factory of list and `mp[pf[i]]` is a list of indices `j` such that `pf[j]` equals `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `l` is `int(data[n + 7])`; `r` is `int(data[index + 1])`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it1` is the position where `l` would be inserted into `v1` to maintain sorted order; `it2` is the position where `r` would be inserted into `v2` to maintain sorted order, minus 1; `results` contains the original contents plus an additional 'YES' string if `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`; otherwise, `results` contains the original contents plus an additional 'NO' string.**
