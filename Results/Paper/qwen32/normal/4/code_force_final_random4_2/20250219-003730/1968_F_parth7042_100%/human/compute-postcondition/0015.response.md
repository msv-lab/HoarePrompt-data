The code increments the value of `index` by 1. Given the initial state, `index` was 3, so after the increment, `index` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing the split input values where the first element can be converted to an integer greater than 0; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0; `index` is 4; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of the second element in `data` and must be greater than or equal to 1; `q` is the integer value of the third element in `data`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[3]` which is `int(data[3])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[0]` is `[0]`.**
