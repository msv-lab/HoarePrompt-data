The code snippet provided increments the variable `index` by 1. None of the other variables are modified by this statement.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing at least 4 elements where `data[3]` is a string that can be converted to an integer greater than or equal to 1; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1; `index` is `n + 8`; `n` is `int(data[n + 3])`; `q` is `int(data[n + 4])`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[n + 7])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` and `pf[n + 1]` is `pf[n] ^ a[n + 1]`; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list and `mp[pf[i]]` contains `[i]` (or `mp[0]` contains `[0, i]` if `pf[i]` is `0`); `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries; `i` is `n + 1`.**
