Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a` and an integer `q` representing the number of queries. The array `a` contains `n` integers, and each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r`. The function processes each query to determine some output based on the subarray `a[l-1:r]` and returns the results of all queries for all test cases.**
