Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing at least `2n + 5` elements, `data[index - 2]` is a string representing an integer value greater than or equal to 1, `n` is `int(data[index - 2])`, `q` is `int(data[index - 1])`, `index` is `2n + 5 + 2*q + 5`, `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 2, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[n]` which is `int(data[index - 1])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` and `pf[i]` at index `i-1` which is unchanged, `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list, `mp[0]` contains the value `[0]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` contains the value `[i, i]`, `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries, `i` is `n`**

In simple terms, the value of `index` has been incremented by 1, making it `2n + 5 + 2*q + 5`. All other variables retain their previous values.
