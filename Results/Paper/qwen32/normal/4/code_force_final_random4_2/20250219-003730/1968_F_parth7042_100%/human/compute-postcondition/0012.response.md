The code snippet `mp[0].append(0)` modifies the defaultdict `mp` by appending the value `0` to the list associated with the key `0`. This means that after the code execution, `mp[0]` will be a list containing a single element `0`.

The other variables remain unchanged based on the provided initial state.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing the split input values where the first element can be converted to an integer greater than 0; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0; `index` is 3; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of the second element in `data`; `q` is the integer value of the third element in `data`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[0]` is `[0]`.**
