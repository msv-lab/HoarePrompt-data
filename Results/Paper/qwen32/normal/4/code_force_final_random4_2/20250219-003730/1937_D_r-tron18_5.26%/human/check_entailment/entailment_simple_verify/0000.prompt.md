You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

    ><<
    
    4
    
    <<<<

    1 4 7 10 8 1 
    
Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the movement of the pinball according to the problem description. The problem requires simulating the movement of a pinball starting from each cell and inverting the character on the cell after each move. The provided code attempts to use some precomputed values and accumulations to determine the number of steps, but it does not correctly account for the inversion of characters and the movement rules described.

Here is a specific case where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
5
><><<
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 4 3 2 5
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- For i=1, the pinball starts at the first cell with '>', moves right to the second cell with '<', inverts it to '>', and moves left to the first cell with '>', inverts it to '<', and moves left out of the grid in 1 second.
- For i=2, the pinball starts at the second cell with '<', moves left to the first cell with '>', inverts it to '<', and moves left out of the grid in 2 seconds. Then it moves right to the second cell with '<', inverts it to '>', and moves right to the third cell with '>', inverts it to '<', and moves right to the fourth cell with '<', inverts it to '>', and moves right out of the grid in 4 seconds.
- For i=3, the pinball starts at the third cell with '>', moves right to the fourth cell with '<', inverts it to '>', and moves right to the fifth cell with '<', inverts it to '>', and moves right out of the grid in 3 seconds.
- For i=4, the pinball starts at the fourth cell with '<', moves left to the third cell with '>', inverts it to '<', and moves left to the second cell with '>', inverts it to '<', and moves left to the first cell with '<', inverts it to '>', and moves left out of the grid in 2 seconds.
- For i=5, the pinball starts at the fifth cell with '<', moves left to the fourth cell with '>', inverts it to '<', and moves left to the third cell with '<', inverts it to '>', and moves left to the second cell with '<', inverts it to '>', and moves left to the first cell with '<', inverts it to '>', and moves left out of the grid in 5 seconds.

However, the provided code does not correctly simulate these movements and inversions, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
