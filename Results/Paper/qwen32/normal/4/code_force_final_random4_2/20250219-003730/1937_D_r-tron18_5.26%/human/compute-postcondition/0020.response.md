The code snippet `preOne.pop()` removes the last element from the list `preOne`. Therefore, the length of `preOne` decreases by 1, and the last element is no longer part of the list.

Given the initial state, `preOne` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0. After `preOne.pop()`, the last accumulated sum is removed, and the length of `preOne` is reduced by 1.

The other variables (`s1`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `suffZero`, `n`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `ans[i]`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, `fi`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the `pop` operation on `preOne`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of integers representing the positions (1-based index) of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of elements in `pre`; `preOne` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element removed; `suffZero` is a list containing a single element, `0`; `n` must be greater than 0; `el` is `s1[i]` which is '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `-1`; `ans[i]` is updated based on the conditions provided; `zeroInd` is `0` if `ol` > `zr`, otherwise it is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`; `oneInd` is `2 - x` if `ol` > `zr`, otherwise it is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`; `fi` is `0` if `ol` > `zr`.**
