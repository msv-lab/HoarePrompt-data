The code snippet updates the value of `ans[i]` based on the given formula. The values of other variables remain unchanged unless specified. Here's the output state:

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers representing the positions (1-based index) of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of elements in `pre`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list containing the elements `[0, i + 1]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `el` is `s1[i]` which is either '<' or '>', and `el` is not '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, `zeroInd` is `i + 1`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`, where `zeroInd` is `i + 1` and `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`. All other variables retain their initial values.
