Postcondition: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of integers representing the positions (1-based index) of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of elements in `pre` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains unchanged; `preOne` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is a list containing a single element, `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it contains elements `[0, i + 1]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is updated based on the conditions provided; `n` must be greater than 0; `el` is `s1[i]` which is either '<' or '>'; `ol` is `totalOne` plus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `totalOne`; `zr` is `-1` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is `0` if `ol` > `zr` and `el` is '>', otherwise it is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)` if `el` is not '>', otherwise it is `i + 1`; `oneInd` is `2 - x` if `ol` > `zr` and `el` is '>', otherwise it is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` if `el` is not '>', otherwise it is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, otherwise `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`; `fi` is `0` if `ol` > `zr` and `el` is '>'. If `el` is not '>', `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, otherwise `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block executes, taking into account the different branches of the if-else statement and the conditions specified for each branch.
