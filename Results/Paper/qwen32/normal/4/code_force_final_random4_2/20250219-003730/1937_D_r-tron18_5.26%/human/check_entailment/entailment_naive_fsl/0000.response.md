Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the movement of the pinball according to the problem description. The problem requires simulating the movement of a pinball starting from each cell and inverting the character on the cell after each move. The provided code attempts to use some precomputed values and accumulations to determine the number of steps, but it does not correctly account for the inversion of characters and the movement rules described.

Here is a specific case where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
5
><><<
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 4 3 2 5
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- For i=1, the pinball starts at the first cell with '>', moves right to the second cell with '<', inverts it to '>', and moves left to the first cell with '>', inverts it to '<', and moves left out of the grid in 1 second.
- For i=2, the pinball starts at the second cell with '<', moves left to the first cell with '>', inverts it to '<', and moves left out of the grid in 2 seconds. Then it moves right to the second cell with '<', inverts it to '>', and moves right to the third cell with '>', inverts it to '<', and moves right to the fourth cell with '<', inverts it to '>', and moves right out of the grid in 4 seconds.
- For i=3, the pinball starts at the third cell with '>', moves right to the fourth cell with '<', inverts it to '>', and moves right to the fifth cell with '<', inverts it to '>', and moves right out of the grid in 3 seconds.
- For i=4, the pinball starts at the fourth cell with '<', moves left to the third cell with '>', inverts it to '<', and moves left to the second cell with '>', inverts it to '<', and moves left to the first cell with '<', inverts it to '>', and moves left out of the grid in 2 seconds.
- For i=5, the pinball starts at the fifth cell with '<', moves left to the fourth cell with '>', inverts it to '<', and moves left to the third cell with '<', inverts it to '>', and moves left to the second cell with '<', inverts it to '>', and moves left to the first cell with '<', inverts it to '>', and moves left out of the grid in 5 seconds.

However, the provided code does not correctly simulate these movements and inversions, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
