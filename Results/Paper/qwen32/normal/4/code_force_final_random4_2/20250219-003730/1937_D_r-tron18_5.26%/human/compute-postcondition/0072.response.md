Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of integers representing the positions (1-based index) of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is updated based on the value of `el` where it is reduced by 1 if `el` is '>'; `preOne` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, and the last element is removed; `suffZero` is a list containing elements that are accumulated sums of positions of '<' characters, starting with a single element `0` and updated by adding `i + 1` if `el` is '<'; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is updated based on the conditions provided; `n` is greater than 0; `el` is `s1[i]` which is either '<' or '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`. `totalOne` is reduced by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `totalOne` has been decreased by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and states.
