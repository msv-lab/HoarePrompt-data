The loop in question is iterating backward over the string `s1` from the last character to the first character. The loop head only contains the variable `i`, which is the loop index.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust the state for the next iteration of the loop. The loop iterates with `i` starting from `n - 1` and decrementing by 1 until it reaches `-1`.

### State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `pre` is a list of integers representing the positions (1-based index) of all '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of elements in `pre` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains unchanged.
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'.
- `suffZero` is a list containing a single element, `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it contains elements `[0, i + 1]`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is updated based on the conditions provided.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `el` is `s1[i]` which is either '<' or '>'.
- `ol` is `totalOne` plus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `totalOne`.
- `zr` is `-1` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `len(suffZero) - 1`.
- `zeroInd` is `0` if `ol` > `zr` and `el` is '>', otherwise it is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)` if `el` is not '>', otherwise it is `i + 1`.
- `oneInd` is `2 - x` if `ol` > `zr` and `el` is '>', otherwise it is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` if `el` is not '>', otherwise it is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, otherwise `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`.
- `fi` is `0` if `ol` > `zr` and `el` is '>'.
- If `el` is not '>', `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, otherwise `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`.

### The loop statement:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop variable `i` is decremented by 1 in each iteration.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k`.

### State at the start of the next iteration:
- To execute the next iteration, `i` should be `k - 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of integers representing the positions (1-based index) of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of elements in `pre` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains unchanged; `preOne` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is a list containing a single element, `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it contains elements `[0, i + 1]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is updated based on the conditions provided; `n` must be greater than 0; `el` is `s1[i]` which is either '<' or '>'; `ol` is `totalOne` plus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `totalOne`; `zr` is `-1` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is `0` if `ol` > `zr` and `el` is '>', otherwise it is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)` if `el` is not '>', otherwise it is `i + 1`; `oneInd` is `2 - x` if `ol` > `zr` and `el` is '>', otherwise it is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` if `el` is not '>', otherwise it is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, otherwise `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`; `fi` is `0` if `ol` > `zr` and `el` is '>'; if `el` is not '>', `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, otherwise `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`; `i` is `k - 1`**.
