### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the program, we need to verify that the provided functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, correctly simulate the pinball movement as described in the problem statement and produce the expected output for each query.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates and returns the difference between the last element of the list `arr` and the element at the index `max(-n, -1 - times)` in `arr`.
   - This seems to be used for computing differences in cumulative sums, which is a common technique in prefix and suffix sum problems.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes the string `s1` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - It calculates cumulative sums for positions of '>' characters (`preOne`) and suffix sums for positions of '<' characters (`suffZero`).
   - Depending on the counts of '<' and '>' characters encountered, it computes the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.
   - The main logic involves:
     - Preprocessing the positions of '>' characters and calculating their cumulative sums.
     - Iterating over the string in reverse to calculate the time for each starting position based on the counts of '<' and '>' characters.
     - Using `func_1` to compute differences in cumulative sums to determine the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.

### Analysis of `func_2`:

- **Initialization**:
  - `pre` stores the 1-based positions of '>' characters.
  - `preOne` is the cumulative sum of `pre`.
  - `suffZero` is initialized with a single 0 and will store cumulative sums of positions of '<' characters as we iterate from right to left.
  - `ans` is initialized to store the results for each query.

- **Reverse Iteration**:
  - For each character in the string from right to left:
    - If the character is '>', it computes the time based on the counts of '<' and '>' characters.
    - If the character is '<', it updates the cumulative sum for '<' characters and computes the time similarly.

- **Computation of Time**:
  - The computation involves comparing the counts of '<' and '>' characters and using `func_1` to compute differences in cumulative sums to determine the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.

### Conclusion:

The provided functions seem to correctly simulate the pinball movement and compute the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position based on the given rules. The use of cumulative sums and conditions based on counts of '<' and '>' characters is consistent with the problem requirements.

Thus, the program appears to be correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
