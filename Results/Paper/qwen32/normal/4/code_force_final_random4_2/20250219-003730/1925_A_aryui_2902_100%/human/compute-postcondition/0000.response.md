The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers with specific constraints.

After executing the code snippet, the values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input values. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 676, `n` is the first integer read from the input, and `k` is the second integer read from the input.**
