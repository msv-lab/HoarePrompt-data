Functionality: **The function `func_3` determines the position of an integer `k` within a permutation array `arr` of length `n` and prints whether `k` is found at a specific index or not. If `k` is found, it prints `0`. If `k` is not found, it prints `1` followed by the index of the closest element to `k` and the original position of `k` in the array.**
