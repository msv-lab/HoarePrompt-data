You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_1`, which is responsible for reading input from the user and returning a map object of integers.
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers derived from the user's input, where the input is expected to be a string of space-separated numbers.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function signature is not provided in the given code snippet. However, based on the context and the problem description, we can infer a possible function signature and its precondition. If we consider a function that might be involved in the process, it could look something like `def rearrange_permutation(p, x):`. In this case, the precondition would be: p is a list representing a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n.

    #The program returns a list that is the result of converting the return value of `func_1()` to a list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to rearrange a permutation such that after performing binary search, the element at the final `l` index is equal to `x`. We are allowed to perform at most 2 swaps to achieve this.

### Binary Search Process Recap
The binary search process in the problem is:
1. Initialize `l = 0` and `r = n - 1`.
2. Repeat until `r - l = 1`:
   - Compute `m = floor((r + l) / 2)`.
   - If `p[m] <= x`, set `l = m`.
   - Otherwise, set `r = m`.
3. At the end, `p[l]` should be equal to `x`.

### Provided Program Analysis
The provided program consists of three functions:
- `func_1`: Reads a line of input and splits it into integers.
- `func_2`: Reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers.
- `func_3`: Handles each test case by:
  - Reading the permutation length `n` and the target value `k`.
  - Reading the permutation array.
  - Finding the position `pos` of the target value `k` in the array.
  - Performing a binary search to find the position `low` where the binary search would end.
  - If `p[low]` is equal to `k`, no swaps are needed (`print(0)`).
  - Otherwise, it swaps the element at `low` with the element at `pos` (`print(1)` followed by the indices).

### Correctness Check
The program's approach is flawed for the following reasons:
1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The program performs binary search but does not correctly implement the binary search logic to ensure `p[l]` ends up being `x`. The binary search should be able to correctly identify the position of `x` after at most two swaps.
2. **Handling of Swap Operations**: The program only considers one swap operation in the worst case scenario, which might not be sufficient to guarantee that `p[l]` is `x` after the binary search completes.

### Counterexample
Consider the test case:
```
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```
The program might output:
```
1
2 3
```
However, after this swap, the array becomes `[4, 1, 3, 5, 2, 6]`, and the binary search will still not end with `p[l]` being `3`.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not guarantee that `p[l]` will be `x` after performing at most 2 swaps and running the binary search. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
