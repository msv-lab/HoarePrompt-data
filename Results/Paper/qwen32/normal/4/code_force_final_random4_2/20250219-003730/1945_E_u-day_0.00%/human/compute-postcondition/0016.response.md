To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to execute, we need to focus on the condition `low + 1 < high`. The variables `low` and `high` are the only ones mentioned in the loop condition, so we will adjust only these.

Given:
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is `n - 1`.

The loop condition `low + 1 < high` translates to `0 + 1 < high` or `1 < high`. For the loop to execute, `high` must be greater than 1.

Since `high` is `n - 1`, we need `n - 1 > 1`, which simplifies to `n > 2`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2 to ensure that `high` is greater than 1.

No other variables need to be adjusted because they do not appear in the loop condition.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `1 <= k <= n`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, and `pos` is the index `i` where `arr[i]` equals `k` if such an `i` exists within the range `[0, n-1]`; otherwise, `pos` remains -1. `low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, `st` is an empty set.**
