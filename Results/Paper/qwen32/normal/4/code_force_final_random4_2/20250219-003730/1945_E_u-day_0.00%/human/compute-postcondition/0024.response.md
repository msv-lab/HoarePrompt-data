To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop condition `low + 1 < high`. The variables `low` and `high` are the only ones that can be adjusted according to the loop head.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 2
- `1 <= k <= n`
- `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`
- `pos` is the index `i` where `arr[i]` equals `k` if such an `i` exists within the range `[0, n-1]`; otherwise, `pos` remains -1
- `low` is either 0 or `(n - 1) // 2`
- `high` is either `(n - 1) // 2` or `n - 1`
- `st` is a set containing `mid`
- `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`
- If `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, then `low` is 0 and `high` is `(n - 1) // 2`
- If `arr[mid]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `low` is `(n - 1) // 2` and `high` is `n - 1`

We need to ensure that `low + 1 < high` for the loop to execute again.

### Analysis:
- If `low` is 0 and `high` is `(n - 1) // 2`, then we need `1 < (n - 1) // 2`.
- If `low` is `(n - 1) // 2` and `high` is `n - 1`, then we need `((n - 1) // 2) + 1 < n - 1`.

Given that `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `(n - 1) // 2` is at least 1. Therefore, the conditions for the loop to execute again are:
- For `low = 0` and `high = (n - 1) // 2`, we need `1 < (n - 1) // 2`, which is true for `n > 3`.
- For `low = (n - 1) // 2` and `high = n - 1`, we need `((n - 1) // 2) + 1 < n - 1`, which simplifies to `1 < (n - 1) // 2`, which is true for `n > 3`.

For `n = 3`, `(n - 1) // 2` is 1, and the conditions become:
- For `low = 0` and `high = 1`, we need `1 < 1`, which is false.
- For `low = 1` and `high = 2`, we need `2 < 2`, which is false.

Therefore, for `n = 3`, the loop cannot execute again with the given conditions. However, for `n > 3`, the loop can execute again.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `n > 3` and adjust `low` and `high` accordingly. If `n = 3`, the loop cannot execute again with the given conditions.

State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `low` is 0, `high` is `(n - 1) // 2` or `low` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `high` is `n - 1`**
