The value of `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`. The previous states of `n`, `low`, `high`, and the conditions based on `arr[mid]` relative to `k` are still valid. Since `low` is 0 and `high` is `n - 1`, the new value of `mid` will be `(0 + (n - 1)) // 2`, which simplifies to `(n - 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`, and `st` contains `mid`. If `arr[mid] > k`, then `high` is set to `mid`. Otherwise, `low` is set to `mid`.**
