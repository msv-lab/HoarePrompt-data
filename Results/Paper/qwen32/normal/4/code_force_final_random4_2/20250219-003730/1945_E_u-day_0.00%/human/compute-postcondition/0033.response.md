The value of `high` is updated to be equal to `mid`. Since `mid` is calculated as `(n - 1) // 2`, `high` will now also have the value `(n - 1) // 2`. The values of `n`, `low`, `mid`, and `st` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `low` is 0, `high` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`, and `st` contains `mid`.**
