Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

# Program:
result = func_1()
Ron_co = 0
Hib_co = 0
for sublist in result:
    num_1 = sublist[0]
    num_2 = sublist[1]
    if num_1 > num_2:
        Ron_co += 1
    elif num_1 == num_2:
        continue
    else:
        Hib_co += 1
if Ron_co > Hib_co:
    print('Ron')
else:
    print('Hermione')

def func_1():
    numbers = []
    while True:
        nums = input().split()
        if len(nums) != 2:
            break
        num1 = int(nums[0])
        num2 = int(nums[1])
        numbers.append([num1, num2])
    return numbers





# Execution Summary:
The function reads input representing the edges of a tree with `n` nodes and returns a list of these edges. Each edge is represented as a pair of integers `(u, v)` where `1 <= u, v <= n`. The function stops reading input when a line does not contain exactly two integers.

Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
