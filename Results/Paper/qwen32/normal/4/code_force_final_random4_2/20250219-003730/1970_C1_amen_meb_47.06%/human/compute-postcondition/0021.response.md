Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n representing the edges of the tree, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains a single integer u_1 where 1 <= u_1 <= n, representing the starting node of the game. `numbers` is a list containing the sublists `[num1, num1]` and `[num1, num2]`. `nums` is a list containing the string representation of the input integer `u_1`. `num1` is the integer value of `u_1`. `num2` is the integer value of `nums[1]`, which is also the integer value of `u_1`.**

In this output state, the value of `num2` has been updated to be the integer value of `nums[1]`, which is the same as `num1` and `u_1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
