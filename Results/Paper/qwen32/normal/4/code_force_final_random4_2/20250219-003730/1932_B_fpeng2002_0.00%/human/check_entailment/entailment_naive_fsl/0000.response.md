Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the year in which the n-th sign will occur. Specifically, the logic for determining the year in which each subsequent sign occurs is incorrect.

The line `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` does not properly calculate the next occurrence of the sign. Let's break down why this is incorrect:

1. The correct approach is to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than the current `start_year`.
2. The correct formula to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` after `start_year` is `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.

The current implementation adds an extra `+1` inside the formula, which shifts the calculation incorrectly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)
```

This corrected version ensures that the next occurrence of the sign is calculated correctly by finding the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than the current `start_year`.

To illustrate the problem with the original code, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
2
3 2
```

Expected Output:
```
4
```

Explanation:
- The first sign occurs in year 3.
- The tribe waits for the second sign starting from year 4.
- The second sign occurs in year 4 (since 4 is a multiple of 2 and is the smallest multiple of 2 greater than 3).

However, the original program would incorrectly output `6` for this test case because of the incorrect formula.
