The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `start_year`. This does not affect the other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, `x`). 

Output State: **`num_tests` is at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `start_year` is 0, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.**
