The provided code snippet reassigns the `nums` variable by reading a new list of integers from the input. This means the previous list stored in `nums` is discarded and replaced with the new list. The other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, and `start_year`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a new list of integers read from the input, `start_year` is the final value after applying the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each element in the previous `nums`.**
