Output State: **`num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one element, `start_year` is `((0 + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`**

In simpler terms, `start_year` is recalculated as `((1 // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x])`, where `x` is an index that is not specified in the given code snippet, but it is implied to be related to the list `nums`. Other variables remain unchanged.
