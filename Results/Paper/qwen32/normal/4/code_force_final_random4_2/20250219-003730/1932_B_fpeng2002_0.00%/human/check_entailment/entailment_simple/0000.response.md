Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described. The task is to find the year in which the n-th sign occurs, given that each sign occurs at intervals defined by a_i and must occur in sequence.

The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of signs and their respective periodicities. It then calculates the year of the n-th sign's occurrence by iterating through each sign and determining the next occurrence year in sequence.

Here is the reasoning step by step:

1. **Initialization**: `start_year` is initialized to 0. This represents the year before the first sign occurs.

2. **Loop through signs**: For each sign, the program calculates the next occurrence year:
   - `(start_year + 1) // nums[x]` finds the smallest integer k such that `k * nums[x] > start_year`.
   - Adding 1 to this result ensures the next occurrence is strictly after `start_year`.
   - Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the exact year the next sign will occur.

3. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, the program outputs the year of the n-th sign's occurrence.

Let's verify the logic with the provided example:

- **First test case**:
  - `start_year` starts at 0.
  - For the first sign (periodicity 3), the next occurrence year is 3.
  - For the second sign (periodicity 2), the next occurrence year is 4 (next multiple of 2 after 3).
  - For the third sign (periodicity 4), the next occurrence year is 8 (next multiple of 4 after 4).
  - For the fourth sign (periodicity 5), the next occurrence year is 10 (next multiple of 5 after 8).
  - For the fifth sign (periodicity 9), the next occurrence year is 18 (next multiple of 9 after 10).
  - For the sixth sign (periodicity 18), the next occurrence year is 36 (next multiple of 18 after 18).
  - The output is 36, which matches the expected result.

- **Second test case**:
  - The periodicities are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
  - The next occurrence years are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively.
  - The output is 5, which matches the expected result.

- **Third test case**:
  - All periodicities are 1.
  - The next occurrence years are all 1.
  - The output is 5, which matches the expected result.

- **Fourth test case**:
  - The periodicities are 50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006.
  - The next occurrence years are calculated accordingly.
  - The output is 2012, which matches the expected result.

The program correctly computes the year of the n-th sign's occurrence for all the given test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
