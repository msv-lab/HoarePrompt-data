Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the number of signs, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the periodicities of the signs. The function returns the result for each test case, which is not specified in detail here, but it processes the periodicities of the signs for each test case.**
