Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `i` is 2; `n` is the first integer from the new input; `k` is the second integer from the new input. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, then `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. Otherwise, `k` is less than `n - 1`.**

Given the nature of the if-else block where both the if and else parts essentially repeat the same condition and postcondition, the overall postcondition remains the same as the individual postconditions of the if and else parts.
