Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. The variables `n` and `k` from the initial state remain unchanged as their values are not yet assigned.**

This means that `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer input, which indicates the number of test cases. The variables `n` and `k` are still in their initial state as their values have not yet been defined in the provided code snippet.
