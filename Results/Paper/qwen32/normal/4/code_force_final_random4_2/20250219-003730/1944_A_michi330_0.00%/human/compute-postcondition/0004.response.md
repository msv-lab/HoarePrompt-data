Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `k` is the second input integer.
- It is mentioned that `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The values of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` do not affect the output of this particular print statement because it is explicitly printing the integer `1`.

### Output:
Output: **1**
