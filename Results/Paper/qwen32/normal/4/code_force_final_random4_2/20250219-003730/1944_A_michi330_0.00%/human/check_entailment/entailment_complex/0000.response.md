### Reasoning:

The problem involves determining the minimum number of islands Everule can visit after Dominater destroys up to `k` bridges. Initially, all islands are connected, meaning Everule can visit all `n` islands. Dominaterâ€™s goal is to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach by destroying bridges optimally.

The key insight is that if Dominater can destroy enough bridges to isolate island 1 from all other islands, Everule will only be able to visit island 1. This requires destroying `n - 1` bridges (one to each of the other islands). If `k >= n - 1`, Dominater can achieve this isolation. Otherwise, Everule will still be able to visit at least `n - 1` islands because destroying fewer than `n - 1` bridges will not completely isolate island 1.

The provided program correctly implements this logic. It reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads `n` (number of islands) and `k` (number of bridges Dominater can destroy). It then checks if `k >= n - 1`. If true, it prints `1` (Everule can only visit island 1). Otherwise, it prints `n - 1` (Everule can visit at least `n - 1` islands).

### Correctness:

The program's logic matches the problem's requirements. It correctly determines the minimum number of islands Everule can visit based on the value of `k` relative to `n - 1`.

**Correctness: True**
