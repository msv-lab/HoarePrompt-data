To determine the output of the `print(n - 1)` statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

1. **`t`**: This is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
2. **`i`**: This variable is set to 2, but it is not directly relevant to the `print(n - 1)` statement.
3. **`n`**: This is the first integer from the new input for each test case.
4. **`k`**: This is the second integer from the new input for each test case. The condition regarding `k` (whether it is greater than or equal to `n - 1` or not) does not affect the output of `print(n - 1)` directly.

The `print(n - 1)` statement will output the value of `n - 1` for each test case. Since the exact value of `n` is not specified in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **n - 1 (where n is the first integer from the new input for each test case)**
