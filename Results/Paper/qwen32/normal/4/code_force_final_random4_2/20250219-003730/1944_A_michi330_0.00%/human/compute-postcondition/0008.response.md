The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. Therefore, we need to adjust only these two variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given that the loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i < t` with a step of 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it represents the total number of iterations.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 1. The variable `t` should remain the same, as it is the total number of test cases and does not change throughout the loop.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. `i` is 1. `n` is the first input integer. `k` is the second input integer. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, then `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. Otherwise, `k` is less than `n - 1`.**
