### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine if we can make all the containers have the same amount of water by pouring water from a container with a higher amount to a container with a lower amount, but only in the direction from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index.

The given program checks if the sum of water in all containers is divisible by `n`, which is already guaranteed by the problem statement. Then, it calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`target = total_water // n`).

The program then iterates through the list of containers, maintaining a running sum (`container`) that starts at 0 and updates by adding the difference between the current container's water amount and the target amount. If at any point `container` becomes negative, the program returns 'No', indicating that it's impossible to distribute the water as required without going below zero in any container.

However, there's a flaw in the logic. The check `if container < 0` doesn't correctly determine the feasibility of the operation because it doesn't account for the fact that we can pour water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`. The running sum `container` can indeed go negative if we haven't yet reached a container with enough water to balance the deficit, but this doesn't necessarily mean it's impossible to achieve the goal.

To correctly determine if it's possible to equalize the water, we need to ensure that the cumulative sum of water never goes negative when we consider the operation constraints. The provided solution doesn't handle this correctly because it only checks if the cumulative difference goes negative, which isn't sufficient.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The provided solution is incorrect because it doesn't correctly handle the constraints of the problem, specifically the requirement that water can only be poured from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index. The check `if container < 0` is not sufficient to determine if the water can be distributed as required.
