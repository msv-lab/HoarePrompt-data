Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for certain cases.

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program reads all input at once and then processes it. However, it does not handle multiple test cases correctly. The code assumes that the entire input is a single test case, but the problem description specifies that there can be multiple test cases. The program should read the number of test cases and then process each test case individually.

2. **Function Definition and Usage**: The function `func_1` is defined after it is called, which will result in a `NameError`. The function should be defined before it is called.

3. **Logic for Checking Possibility**: The logic in `func_1` is incorrect. The function checks if the cumulative difference between the current water level and the target level ever becomes negative, which is not the correct condition to determine if it's possible to equalize the water levels. The correct approach involves checking if the prefix sums (cumulative sums) of the differences can be balanced by the allowed operations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

index = 0
t = int(data[index])
index += 1
results = []

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    
    total_water = sum(a)
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    possible = True
    
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:
            possible = False
            break
    
    if possible:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected version reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. It also correctly checks if it is possible to equalize the water levels in all containers by ensuring that the cumulative difference never becomes negative.
