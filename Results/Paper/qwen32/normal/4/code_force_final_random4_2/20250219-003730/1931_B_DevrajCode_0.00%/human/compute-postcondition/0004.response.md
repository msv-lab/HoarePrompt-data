Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9, the sum of a_i is divisible by n, and `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`. Additionally, `total_water` is divisible by `n`. `target` is equal to `total_water // n`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `target` has been calculated as the integer division of `total_water` by `n`. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
