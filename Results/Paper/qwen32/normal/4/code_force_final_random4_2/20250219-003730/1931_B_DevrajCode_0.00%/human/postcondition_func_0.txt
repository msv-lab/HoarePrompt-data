The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. It checks if the sum of the elements in `a` is divisible by `n` and if it's possible to distribute the elements in `a` such that each element is equal to the average of the sum of `a` divided by `n` without any element going below zero during the distribution process. If both conditions are met, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.
