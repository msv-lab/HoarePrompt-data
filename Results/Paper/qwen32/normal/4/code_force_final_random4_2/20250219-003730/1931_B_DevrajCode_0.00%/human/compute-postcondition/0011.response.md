The only object in the loop head is the variable `water`, which iterates over the elements in the list `a`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `water` to the next element in the list `a`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5
- `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9
- `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`
- `total_water` is divisible by `n`
- `target` is equal to `total_water // n`
- `container` is updated to `container + (water - target)`, and `container` is not less than 0

Let's assume that the previous iteration used the `i-th` element of `a` as `water`. Therefore, the next iteration will use the `(i+1)-th` element of `a`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `total_water` is divisible by `n`, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`, `container` is updated to `container + (water - target)`, and `container` is not less than 0, `water` is the next element in the list `a`**

To be more specific, if `water` was `a[i]` in the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `water` will be `a[i+1]`. However, since we don't know the exact index `i` from the provided state, we just denote the next element in the list as the new `water`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `total_water` is divisible by `n`, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`, `container` is updated to `container + (water - target)`, and `container` is not less than 0, `water` is the next element in the list `a`**
