Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to ensure the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Recap
- We need to determine if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water using the given operation.
- The sum of all water in the containers is divisible by `n`, ensuring that there exists a target amount `target = total_water // n` for each container.
- The operation allows pouring water from container `i` to container `j` where `i < j`.

### Key Insight
- To achieve the target amount in each container, we need to ensure that we can pour water from left to right without any container ending up with a negative amount of water at any point.

### Code Analysis
The code follows these steps:
1. Calculate the total amount of water and the target amount for each container.
2. Iterate through the containers, maintaining a running sum (`container`) that tracks the net amount of water that would be left if we were to pour water from left to right to achieve the target.
3. If the running sum ever becomes negative, it returns 'No'.
4. If the loop completes without the running sum going negative, it returns 'Yes'.

### Annotated Code Validation
- The annotations correctly state the program's state at key points:
  - Before the function call, `n` and `a` are correctly initialized.
  - `total_water` is calculated as the sum of `a`.
  - `target` is correctly calculated as `total_water // n`.
  - The `container` variable is used to track the net amount of water.
  - If `container` ever becomes negative, the function returns 'No'.
  - If the loop completes without `container` going negative, the function returns 'Yes'.

### Correctness of the Code
The code correctly implements the key insight:
- It checks if it's possible to pour water from left to right without ever having a negative amount of water, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for the problem.
- The logic is sound and the code handles the input and output as described.

### Final Evaluation
The code is correct and the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
