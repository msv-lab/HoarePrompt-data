Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `total_water` is divisible by `n`, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`, and `container` is updated to `container + (water - target)`. If `container` is less than 0, the program returns 'No'. Otherwise, `container` remains updated as `container + (water - target)` without returning anything.**
