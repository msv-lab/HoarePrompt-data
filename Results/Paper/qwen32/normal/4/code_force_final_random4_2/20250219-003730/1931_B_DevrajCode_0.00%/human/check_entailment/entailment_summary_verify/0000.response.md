Let's carefully analyze the provided program, the problem description, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another, where the pouring can only be done from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index.
- The sum of water in all containers is guaranteed to be divisible by the number of containers.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads input, processes it, and checks if it's possible to equalize the water in all containers using the described operation.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Program:
1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The original program reads all input at once and assumes it's a single test case. However, the problem specifies multiple test cases. The program should handle each test case individually.
2. **Function Definition and Usage**: The function `func_1` is called before it is defined, which will result in a `NameError`. The function should be defined before it is called.
3. **Logic for Checking Possibility**: The logic in `func_1` is incorrect. The program checks if the cumulative difference between the current water level and the target level ever becomes negative, which is not the correct condition to determine if it's possible to equalize the water levels. The correct approach involves checking if the prefix sums (cumulative sums) of the differences can be balanced by the allowed operations.

### Corrected Program:
The corrected version of the program handles multiple test cases, defines the function before calling it, and correctly checks the condition for equalizing the water levels.

### Corrected Program Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
2. **Processing Test Cases**: It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
3. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined before it is called.
4. **Logic for Checking Possibility**: The function calculates the total water and the target water level. It then iterates through the list of water levels, maintaining a cumulative difference between the current water level and the target level. If this cumulative difference ever becomes negative, it means it's not possible to equalize the water levels using the allowed operations, and the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.

### Function Summary:
The function summary provided is accurate. It correctly describes the function's behavior and return values.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is correct in identifying the issues with the program. The corrected version of the program addresses these issues and correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to equalize the water levels in all containers.

Final: **False**

The original program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned in the original assessment, but the corrected version is correct. Since the task is to evaluate the correctness of the given program, the final evaluation is **False**.
