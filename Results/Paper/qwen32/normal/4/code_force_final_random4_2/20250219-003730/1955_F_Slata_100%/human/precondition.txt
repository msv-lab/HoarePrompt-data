test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four integers (p1, p2, p3, p4) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at the beginning of the game, respectively. Each integer in the tuple satisfies 0 <= pi <= 200. The length of test_cases is between 1 and 10^4, inclusive.
