### Reasoning:

To determine if Bob can win, we need to understand the XOR operation and how it affects the sequence of numbers. XOR is a bitwise operation that returns 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they are the same. For Bob to win, the XOR of the remaining numbers in the sequence must be zero.

Here's the breakdown of the numbers and their contributions to the XOR:
- **1 (binary 01)**: XOR with itself results in 0, and XOR with 3 (binary 11) results in 2 (binary 10).
- **2 (binary 10)**: XOR with itself results in 0, and XOR with 3 (binary 11) results in 1 (binary 01).
- **3 (binary 11)**: XOR with itself results in 0, and XOR with 1 (binary 01) results in 2 (binary 10), and with 2 (binary 10) results in 1 (binary 01).
- **4 (binary 100)**: XOR with itself results in 0.

To maximize the number of times Bob wins, Eve should aim to remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. Here's the strategy:
- If the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd, then the XOR of the sequence is non-zero. Eve can remove one of each (1, 2, 3) to make all counts even, which will make the XOR zero.
- If the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are not all odd, Eve can remove pairs of each number to keep the XOR non-zero.

The formula `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win:
- `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` counts the number of pairs of each number that can be removed.
- `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` checks if all counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are odd. If they are, it adds 1 to the count because Eve can remove one of each (1, 2, 3) to make the XOR zero.

### Correctness:
The given program correctly implements the above logic and provides the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

**Correctness: True**
