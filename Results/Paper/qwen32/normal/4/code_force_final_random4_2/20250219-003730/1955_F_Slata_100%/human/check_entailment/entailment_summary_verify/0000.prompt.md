You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on these counts. The result is the sum of half the counts of each number (rounded down) plus one if the sum of the remainders when each count is divided by two equals three.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program provided for the given problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game with a sequence of integers.
- Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
- Bob wins if the XOR is zero.
- Eve removes one number at a time until the sequence is empty.
- We need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve plays optimally.

### Key Points:
- XOR of a sequence is zero if and only if the count of each bit position across all numbers is even.
- Since the numbers are limited to 1, 2, 3, and 4, their binary representations are:
  - 1: `01`
  - 2: `10`
  - 3: `11`
  - 4: `00`
- For Bob to win, the XOR of the remaining numbers must be zero.
- Eve can strategically remove numbers to maximize Bob's wins.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The program uses the formula `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.

Let's break down the formula:
- `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` counts the maximum number of pairs for each number type. If Eve removes pairs, Bob can win because the XOR of pairs (e.g., `1 XOR 1`, `2 XOR 2`, etc.) is zero.
- `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` checks if there is exactly one of each of 1, 2, and 3 left after removing pairs. If so, removing any one of them will result in the XOR of the remaining numbers being zero.

### Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:
1. **Input:** `1 1 1 0`
   - Pairs: `0 // 2 + 0 // 2 + 0 // 2 + 0 // 2 = 0`
   - Leftover check: `1 + 1 + 1 == 3` → `1`
   - **Result:** `0 + 1 = 1` (Correct)
2. **Input:** `1 0 1 2`
   - Pairs: `0 // 2 + 0 // 2 + 0 // 2 + 2 // 2 = 1`
   - Leftover check: `1 + 0 + 1 != 3` → `0`
   - **Result:** `1 + 0 = 1` (Correct)
3. **Input:** `2 2 2 0`
   - Pairs: `2 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 0 // 2 = 3`
   - Leftover check: `0 + 0 + 0 != 3` → `0`
   - **Result:** `3 + 0 = 3` (Correct)
4. **Input:** `3 3 2 0`
   - Pairs: `3 // 2 + 3 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 0 // 2 = 4`
   - Leftover check: `1 + 1 + 0 != 3` → `0`
   - **Result:** `4 + 0 = 3` (Correct)
5. **Input:** `0 9 9 9`
   - Pairs: `0 // 2 + 9 // 2 + 9 // 2 + 9 // 2 = 13`
   - Leftover check: `0 + 1 + 1 + 1 != 3` → `0`
   - **Result:** `13 + 0 = 13` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program seems to correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. It handles the pairs and the leftover condition correctly for the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by considering pairs and the specific condition for leftovers.
