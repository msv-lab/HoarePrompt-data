To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze if it correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice, given the optimal strategy of Eve in removing numbers from the sequence.

### Problem Analysis

The game revolves around the XOR operation. Alice wins if the XOR of the remaining numbers is non-zero, and Bob wins if the XOR is zero. To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to leave an even number of each type of number (1, 2, 3, 4) because the XOR of an even number of identical numbers is zero.

### Key Observations

1. **XOR Properties**:
   - XOR of an even number of identical numbers is zero.
   - XOR of an odd number of 1s is 1.
   - XOR of an odd number of 2s is 2.
   - XOR of an odd number of 3s is 3.
   - XOR of an odd number of 4s is 4.
   - XOR of a mix of numbers will be non-zero if the count of any number type is odd.

2. **Game Strategy**:
   - Eve's goal is to maximize the number of times the XOR is zero.
   - This can be achieved by ensuring that after removing a number, the count of each number type remains even as much as possible.

### Program Analysis

The program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by considering the following:
- For each type of number (1, 2, 3, 4), it calculates how many pairs (even numbers) can be formed (`a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2`).
- It then checks if there is an odd count of all four numbers (`a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3`). If true, it adds 1 to the count, which accounts for the scenario where the last remaining numbers are one of each type (1, 2, 3), making the XOR zero.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **First Example**:
   - Input: `1 1 1 0`
   - Calculation: `1 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 0 // 2 + int(1 % 2 + 1 % 2 + 1 % 2 == 3)`
   - Result: `0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Bob wins once when all numbers are removed)

2. **Second Example**:
   - Input: `1 0 1 2`
   - Calculation: `1 // 2 + 0 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 2 // 2 + int(1 % 2 + 0 % 2 + 1 % 2 == 3)`
   - Result: `0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Bob wins once by removing one 1 and one 3)

3. **Third Example**:
   - Input: `2 2 2 0`
   - Calculation: `2 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 0 // 2 + int(2 % 2 + 2 % 2 + 2 % 2 == 3)`
   - Result: `1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3`
   - Output: `3` (Bob wins three times by leaving pairs of numbers)

4. **Fourth Example**:
   - Input: `3 3 2 0`
   - Calculation: `3 // 2 + 3 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 0 // 2 + int(3 % 2 + 3 % 2 + 2 % 2 == 3)`
   - Result: `1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 4`
   - Output: `3` (Bob wins three times by leaving pairs of numbers, with the last removal making the XOR zero)

5. **Fifth Example**:
   - Input: `0 9 9 9`
   - Calculation: `0 // 2 + 9 // 2 + 9 // 2 + 9 // 2 + int(0 % 2 + 9 % 2 + 9 % 2 == 3)`
   - Result: `0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 13`
   - Output: `12` (Bob wins twelve times by leaving pairs of numbers)

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice by considering the optimal strategy of Eve in removing numbers. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
