The code snippet provided is:
```
i -= 1
```

This line of code decrements the value of the variable `i` by 1. The initial state specifies that `i` is initially equal to `N - 3`. Therefore, after executing `i -= 1`, the new value of `i` will be `N - 4`.

All other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions about `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, `cur`, `nums_left`, and `ans` still hold true.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 4, `M1` and `M2` are integers obtained from the input, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, the first element of `L` is 1, and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`, at least one of the following is true: `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the last second element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`, `M1` is greater than 1, `cur` is `M1 - 5` if `i` is equal to `L[cur]`, otherwise `cur` is `M1 - 4`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 5`, `i` is `N - 4`, `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` and is further updated based on conditions.**
