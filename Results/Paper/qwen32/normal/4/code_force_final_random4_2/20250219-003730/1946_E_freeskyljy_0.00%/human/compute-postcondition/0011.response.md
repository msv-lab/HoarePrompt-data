Postcondition: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers obtained from the input; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is 1, and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`. At least one of the following is true: `M1` is less than or equal to 1, `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the last second element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`.**
