Output State: **`N` must be greater than 3, and `i` must be less than `N - 1`. If `i` equals `R[cur]`, `cur` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `(ans * nums_left) % MOD`. `nums_left` is decreased by 1. `i` is increased by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged except for `i`, which is now one more than its previous value.
