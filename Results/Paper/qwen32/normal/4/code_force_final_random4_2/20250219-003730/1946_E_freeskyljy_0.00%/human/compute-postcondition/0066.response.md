Functionality: **The function accepts three integers `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2`, representing the length of a permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively. It also accepts two lists of integers: the first list contains `m_1` integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, and the second list contains `m_2` integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order. The function returns 1 if a valid permutation exists that satisfies the given prefix and suffix maximum conditions; otherwise, it returns 0.**
