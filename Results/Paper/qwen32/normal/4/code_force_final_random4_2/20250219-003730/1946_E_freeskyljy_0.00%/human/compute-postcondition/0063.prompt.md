Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `N`, `M1`, `M2` are integers, `L` and `R` are lists of integers with the last element of `L` equal to the first element of `R`, the first element of `L` is 1, and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`. At least one of the following is true: `M1` is less than or equal to 1, `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the last second element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`. `M2` is greater than 1. If `M1` is greater than 1, then `i` is 2, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - N + 2`, and `ans` is `final_computed_ans`. If `M1` is not greater than 1, then there are no changes to `i`, `nums_left`, `cur`, or `ans`. `nums_left` is `-1` if `M1` is not greater than 1. `cur` is 1. `i` is `N + 1`.
Code of the loop:
while i < N:
    if i == R[cur]:
        cur += 1
    else:
        ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
    nums_left -= 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `N` is an integer greater than 1, `M1` and `M2` are integers, `L` and `R` are lists of integers with the last element of `L` equal to the first element of `R`, the first element of `L` is 1, and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`. At least one of the following is true: `M1` is less than or equal to 1, `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the last second element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`. `M2` is greater than 1. If `M1` is greater than 1, then `i` is 3, and `nums_left` is `L[-1] - N + 2`. If `M1` is not greater than 1, then `i` is 2, and `nums_left` is -1. `cur` is 2 if `i == R[cur]` is true, otherwise `cur` is 1. If `i == R[cur]` is true, `ans` remains `final_computed_ans`. If `i == R[cur]` is false, `ans` is updated to `(ans * nums_left) % MOD`. `nums_left` is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `N` must be greater than 3. If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, `cur` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `(ans * nums_left) % MOD`. `nums_left` is decreased by 1. `i` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `N` must be greater than 3, and `i` must be less than `N - 1`. If `i` equals `R[cur]`, `cur` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `(ans * nums_left) % MOD`. `nums_left` is decreased by 1. `i` is increased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
