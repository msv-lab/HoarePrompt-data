To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition `i > 1`. The variable `i` is initially set to `N - 1`, so we need to ensure that `N - 1 > 1`, which simplifies to `N > 2`.

Given the initial state:
- `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers obtained from the input.
- `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`.
- The first element of `L` is 1, and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`.
- At least one of the following is true: `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the last second element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`.
- `M1` is greater than 1.
- `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1`.
- `cur` is `M1 - 2`.
- `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`.
- `i` is `N - 1`.

The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and it is initially set to `N - 1`. To ensure the loop can execute, we need `N - 1 > 1`, which means `N > 2`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `N` is greater than 2.

State: **`N` must be greater than 2, `M1`, and `M2` are integers obtained from the input; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is 1, and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`. At least one of the following is true: `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the last second element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`. `M1` is greater than 1. `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1`. `cur` is `M1 - 2`. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`. `i` is `N - 1`.**
