The code snippet assigns the value of `L[-1] - 1` to the variable `i`. This means `i` is now equal to the last element of the list `L` minus 1.

Given that `L[-1]` is equal to the first element of `R` and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`, we can deduce that `L[-1]` is `N`. Therefore, `i` is now `N - 1`.

The values of `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, `ans`, `cur`, and `nums_left` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers obtained from the input; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is 1, and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`. At least one of the following is true: `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the last second element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`. `M1` is greater than 1. `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1`. `cur` is `M1 - 2`. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`. `i` is `N - 1`.**
