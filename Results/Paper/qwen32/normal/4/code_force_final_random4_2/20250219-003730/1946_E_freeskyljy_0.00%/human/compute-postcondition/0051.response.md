The `while` loop condition is `i < N`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, the variable `i` must be less than `N`. Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust `i` if necessary to satisfy this condition.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the relevant variables**: The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `N`. We need to ensure `i < N`.

2. **Analyze the current state**:
   - `N` is an integer greater than 1.
   - If `M1` is greater than 1, then `i` is 3.
   - If `M1` is not greater than 1, then `i` is 2.
   - `M2` is greater than 1.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - Since `N` is greater than 1, the loop can execute if `i` is either 2 or 3, provided `i < N`.
   - If `i` is 3, the loop can execute one more time if `N` is greater than 3.
   - If `i` is 2, the loop can execute one more time if `N` is greater than 2, which is always true since `N` is greater than 1.

Given these points, we need to ensure `i < N` for the loop to execute again. If `i` is 3, we need to ensure `N` is greater than 3. If `i` is 2, the loop can execute one more time as long as `N` is greater than 2, which is already given.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is less than `N`. If `i` is 3, we need `N` to be greater than 3. If `i` is 2, no further adjustment is needed.

State: **`N` must be greater than 3 if `i` is 3, otherwise `i` must be less than `N`**. Since `i` can only be 2 or 3 and `N` is greater than 1, the most conservative adjustment that covers both cases is to ensure `N` is greater than 3.

State: **`N` must be greater than 3**.
