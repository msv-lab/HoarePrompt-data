Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer input by the user such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 49\). This means `t` can be any integer from 1 to 50.
2. `n` is an input integer.
3. Depending on whether `n` is odd or even:
   - If `n` is odd, nothing additional happens to `pattern`.
   - If `n` is even, `pattern` is a list containing `n` characters, alternating between 'A' and 'B', starting with 'A' if `n // 2` is odd, and starting with 'B' if `n // 2` is even.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `pattern`. The statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Output:
The code will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or `pattern`.

Output: **YES**
