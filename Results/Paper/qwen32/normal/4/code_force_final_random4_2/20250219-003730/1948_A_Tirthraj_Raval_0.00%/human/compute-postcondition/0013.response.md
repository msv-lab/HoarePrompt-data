The code snippet appends either 'A' or 'B' to the `pattern` list based on the parity of `i` after it has been incremented by 1. The expression `'AB'[i % 2 ^ 1]` determines which character to append. Since `i` is incremented by 1 before this operation, the parity of `i` changes, affecting the character appended.

- If `i` was even before the increment, `i` becomes odd, and `i % 2` is 1. Therefore, `i % 2 ^ 1` evaluates to 0, and `'AB'[0]` is 'A'.
- If `i` was odd before the increment, `i` becomes even, and `i % 2` is 0. Therefore, `i % 2 ^ 1` evaluates to 1, and `'AB'[1]` is 'B'.

Thus, the `pattern` list gains an element that is 'A' if `i` was odd before the increment, and 'B' if `i` was even before the increment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50; `n` is an even integer and at least 2; `i` is incremented by 1; `pattern` has an additional element which is 'A' if `i` was odd before the increment, and 'B' if `i` was even before the increment.**
