The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t` and `n`, but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the value of `t` (which is an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50) and `n` (which is an even integer) does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or conditions that are not explicitly provided in the code, the output will simply be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
