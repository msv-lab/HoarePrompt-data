The code appends either 'A' or 'B' to the `pattern` list based on the value of `i % 2`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 before this operation, the new value of `i` determines the element to append.

- If `i` was even before being incremented, `i % 2` will now be 1, and 'B' will be appended to `pattern`.
- If `i` was odd before being incremented, `i % 2` will now be 0, and 'A' will be appended to `pattern`.

The values of `t`, `n`, and the initial elements of `pattern` remain unchanged. The only change is the addition of a new element to the `pattern` list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 49; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `pattern` is a list with the last element being either 'A' or 'B' and now includes an additional element which is 'A' if the new `i` is even, or 'B' if the new `i` is odd; `i` is incremented by 1.**
