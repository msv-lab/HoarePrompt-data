The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state mentions that `t` and `n` are input integers and `pattern` remains unchanged, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `pattern` do not affect the output of this specific print statement.

Since the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state, the output will simply be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
