The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, after executing the code, `t` will hold the integer value input by the user, which is still within the range of 1 to 50. The variable `n` and the test cases related to `n` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.**
