Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly determine the maximum number of draws based on the provided problem description. Here are the issues with the program:

1. **Calculation of Draws**: The program calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2` and `y` as `a + b`, and then prints `min(x, y)`. This logic does not correctly determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred. The correct approach involves checking the consistency of the scores and calculating the maximum possible draws based on the given scores.

2. **Checking Consistency**: The program does not properly check if the given scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are consistent with any valid set of games. For example, if `p1 + p2 + p3` is odd, it is impossible to have a valid set of games, and the program correctly prints `-1` in this case. However, there are other cases where the scores are inconsistent, and the program does not handle them correctly.

3. **Correct Approach**: The correct approach involves checking the following:
   - If `p1 + p2 + p3` is odd, print `-1` because the total points must be even.
   - If `p1 + p2 < p3`, print `-1` because the sum of the two smaller scores cannot be less than the largest score.
   - Otherwise, calculate the maximum number of draws by considering the total points and the distribution among the players.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if a + b < c:
            print(-1)
            continue
        # Calculate the maximum number of draws
        total_points = a + b + c
        max_draws = (total_points - c) // 2
        print(max_draws)

func()
```

This corrected program checks the consistency of the scores and calculates the maximum number of draws correctly.
