`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. The number of test cases `t` is now known, but the specific scores `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` for each test case are still to be provided.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `p_1` is either 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, `p_2` is either 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, `p_3` is either 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30**
