The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement has no effect on the variables or the program state.

Therefore, the values of the variables `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged after the `continue` statement is executed.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0; `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input, and the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd.**
