The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. This means the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be updated based on the input provided. The initial state mentioned that `a`, `b`, and `c` are new integers provided by the input and that their sum is odd. This condition remains valid after the input is taken.

The values of `x` and `y` are dependent on the initial values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, and since those values are now updated, `x` and `y` need to be recalculated based on the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, the code snippet provided does not update `x` and `y`, so their values remain as they were initially defined in terms of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

The variables `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers provided by the input, and their sum is odd; `x` is the integer value of (a + b + c) // 2; `y` is the integer value of a + b.**
