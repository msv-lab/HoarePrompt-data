### Reasoning:

To determine if the program is correct, we need to analyze the logic it uses to determine the maximum possible number of draws and whether the scores are consistent with any valid set of games.

1. **Sum of Scores Modulo 2 Check**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` because an odd total score is impossible since each game results in an even total score (either 0+2, 2+0, or 1+1).
   - This check is correct because in any valid set of games, the total points awarded must be even.

2. **Calculating Maximum Draws**:
   - The program calculates `x = (a + b + c) // 2`, which is half of the total points.
   - It then calculates `y = a + b`, which is the sum of the points of the two players with the lower scores.
   - The program prints `min(x, y)`, which is the maximum possible number of draws. The logic here is that:
     - `x` represents the total number of games (since each game contributes 2 points in total, and half of this is the number of games).
     - `y` represents the maximum number of games that could have been played between the two players with the lower scores (since they have a combined score of `y`).
     - The actual number of draws is constrained by both the total number of games (`x`) and the number of games that could have been played between the two players with the lower scores (`y`).

3. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `0 1 1`, the sum is `2`, which is even. `x = 1` and `y = 1`, so the program correctly prints `1`.
   - For the input `1 1 2`, the sum is `4`, which is even. `x = 2` and `y = 2`, so the program correctly prints `2`.
   - For the input `1 1 10`, the sum is `12`, which is even. `x = 6` and `y = 2`, so the program correctly prints `2`.
   - For the input `1 1 1`, the sum is `3`, which is odd, so the program correctly prints `-1`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where no games were played (`0 0 0`) correctly by printing `0`.
   - It also handles cases where the scores are not possible (e.g., `1 1 1`) correctly by printing `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws and checks for consistency of the scores with valid games. Therefore, the program is correct.
