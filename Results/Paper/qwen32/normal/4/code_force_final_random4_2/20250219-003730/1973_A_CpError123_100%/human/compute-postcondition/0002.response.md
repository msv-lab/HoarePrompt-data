The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state of the variables `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remains unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are newly assigned based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0; `p_1` is either 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30; `p_2` is either 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30; `p_3` is either 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input.**
