The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `-1`. The initial state provides several variables (`t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `a`, `b`, `c`) and their constraints, but these do not affect the execution of the `print(-1)` statement. The `print` statement is independent of these variables and directly outputs the value `-1`.

Output: **-1**
