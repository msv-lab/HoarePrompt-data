Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the original assessment to ensure the program correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Total Points Constraint**: The total points across all players must be even because each game results in a total of 2 points being awarded (either 2 to the winner, or 1 to each player in case of a draw).
2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The maximum number of draws can be calculated by considering the total points and the sum of the points of the two players with the lowest scores. This is because draws can only occur between the players, and the points of the two lower-scoring players would be maximized if all their games were draws.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading the scores of the three players.
2. **Total Points Check**: The program checks if the sum of the scores is even. If it isn't, it prints `-1` because it's impossible to have a valid set of games that results in an odd total score.
3. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `x` as half of the total points, which represents the maximum possible number of games played (since each game contributes 2 points).
   - The program calculates `y` as the sum of the points of the two players with the lowest scores (`a + b`).
   - The program prints the minimum of `x` and `y`, which is the maximum possible number of draws.

### Validation Against Test Cases:
Let's validate the program against the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**: `0 0 0`
   - Total points: 0 (even)
   - `x = 0`, `y = 0`
   - Output: `0` (correct)

2. **Test Case 2**: `0 1 1`
   - Total points: 2 (even)
   - `x = 1`, `y = 1`
   - Output: `1` (correct)

3. **Test Case 3**: `1 1 1`
   - Total points: 3 (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (correct)

4. **Test Case 4**: `1 1 2`
   - Total points: 4 (even)
   - `x = 2`, `y = 2`
   - Output: `2` (correct)

5. **Test Case 5**: `3 3 3`
   - Total points: 9 (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (correct)

6. **Test Case 6**: `3 4 5`
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - `x = 6`, `y = 7`
   - Output: `6` (correct)

7. **Test Case 7**: `1 1 10`
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - `x = 6`, `y = 2`
   - Output: `2` (correct)

### Detailed Reasoning:
- **Total Points Constraint**: The program correctly checks if the total points are even. This is a necessary condition for the scores to be valid.
- **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
  - The value of `x` correctly represents the maximum number of games that could have been played.
  - The value of `y` correctly represents the sum of the points of the two players with the lowest scores.
  - The minimum of `x` and `y` is the correct maximum number of draws because:
    - `x` limits the number of games, and since each game can be a draw, `x` is an upper bound on the number of draws.
    - `y` represents the total points of the two lower-scoring players. If all their games were draws, they would have exactly `y` points, which means the maximum number of draws is limited by `y`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given test cases and adheres to the logic required to solve the problem. It correctly checks for the even total points and calculates the maximum number of draws based on the provided scores.

**Final:** **True**
