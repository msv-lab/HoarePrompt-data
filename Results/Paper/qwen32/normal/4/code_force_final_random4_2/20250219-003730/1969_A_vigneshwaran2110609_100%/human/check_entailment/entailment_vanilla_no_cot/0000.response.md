Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Let's analyze why:

1. **Logic Flaw**:
   - The program is supposed to find the minimum number of invitations needed such that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - The program currently only checks if there is a mutual best friend relationship (i.e., if `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`). If such a pair is found, it assumes that 2 invitations are enough. However, this is not always correct because there might be other configurations where more than 2 invitations are needed, even if a mutual pair exists.
   - If no such mutual pair is found, the program assumes that 3 invitations are needed, which is not necessarily true either. There could be configurations where 2 invitations are still sufficient but the mutual pair check fails.

2. **Implementation Flaw**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the minimum number of invitations required is more than 3. It only considers 2 and 3 as possible answers, which is incorrect for some configurations.
   - The program also does not account for the fact that the minimum number of invitations needed could be more than the number of mutual pairs. For example, in a configuration where there are no mutual pairs but there exists a way to invite 2 friends such that both come, the program would incorrectly output 3.

To correctly solve the problem, a more comprehensive approach is needed, such as:
- Checking all possible pairs of friends to see if inviting them would bring at least 2 friends to the party.
- Using a graph-based approach to find the minimum number of nodes to cover at least 2 edges in a directed graph where each node points to its best friend.

Given these issues, the provided program is incorrect.
