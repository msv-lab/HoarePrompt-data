Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 2`, `l` is a list of integers derived from the input, `x` is greater than `i_prev + 2`, and `flag` is `True`**

Explanation: The value of `flag` has been explicitly set to `True` by the code, while the values of `i`, `l`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state.
