The provided code snippet contains only a `break` statement, which does not affect the values of any variables. The `break` statement exits the innermost loop or switch construct, but it does not modify any variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `l`, `x`, and `flag` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 2`, `l` is a list of integers derived from the input, `x` is greater than `i_prev + 2`, and `flag` is `True`.**
