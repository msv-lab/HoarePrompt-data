Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer input by the user such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n]; `x` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is now assigned the value of the integer input by the user, while the values of `t`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged.
