The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `l`. This means that `l` will now hold the integers provided in the input.

The initial state mentioned other variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, and `x`), but none of these are affected by the code snippet provided. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer input by the user such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n]; `x` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input.**
