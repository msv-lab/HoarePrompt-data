The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4. Additionally, `n` must be greater than 4 to allow the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4**
