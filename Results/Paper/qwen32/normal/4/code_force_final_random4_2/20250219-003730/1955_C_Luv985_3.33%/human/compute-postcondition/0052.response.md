The code snippet `a[r] -= mi` subtracts the minimum value `mi` (which is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the operation) from `a[r]`. Therefore, the value of `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - mi` and `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi`, and each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are not both zero; `l` is not equal to `r`; `k` is positive; `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the operation.**
