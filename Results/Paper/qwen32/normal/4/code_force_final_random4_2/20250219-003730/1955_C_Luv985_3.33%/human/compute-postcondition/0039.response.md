The code snippet `l += 1` increments the value of the variable `l` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the new value of `l` will be its previous value plus 1.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15 minus 2 * `mi`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` is reduced by `mi` and `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`; `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are not both zero; `l` is not equal to `r`; `k` is positive; `mi` is the minimum of the original `a[l]` and `a[r]`; `ans` is increased by 1; `l` is incremented by 1.**
