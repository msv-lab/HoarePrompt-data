Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15 minus 2 * `mi`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` is reduced by `mi` and `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`; `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are not both zero; `l` is not equal to `r`; `k` is positive; `mi` is the minimum of the original `a[l]` and `a[r]`. If `a[l]` is 0, then `ans` is increased by 1 and `l` is incremented by 1; `ans` is increased by 1; `r` is decreased by 1.** 

In natural language: The value of `r` has been decreased by 1. All other variables and conditions remain as specified in the initial state.
