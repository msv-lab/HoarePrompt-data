The code snippet `a[l] -= mi` subtracts the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` from `a[l]`. Given that `mi` is defined as the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, the value of `a[l]` will be reduced by `mi`.

**Output State:**
- `T` is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.
- `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are not both zero.
- `l` is not equal to `r`.
- `k` is positive.
- `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`.
- `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`.

In natural language, the output state is: `T` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `a` has `a[l]` reduced by `mi`, `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are not both zero, `l` remains the same, `r` remains the same, `k` remains the same, and `mi` remains the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` is reduced by `mi` and each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are not both zero; `l` is not equal to `r`; `k` is positive; `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`.**
