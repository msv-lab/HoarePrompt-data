Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `l` is less than `r`, `a` is the list with updated integer values where `a[l]` has been decreased by `mi` and `a[r]` has been decreased by `mi`, `mi` is recalculated as the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and `ans` may have been incremented by 1 or 2 if `a[0]` or `a[r]` were 0 in the if part. If `mi * 2` was not less than or equal to `k`, `t` is `k % 2`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0. `k` is now `k - mi * 2`. If `a[l]` was 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 and `l` is increased by 1.**
