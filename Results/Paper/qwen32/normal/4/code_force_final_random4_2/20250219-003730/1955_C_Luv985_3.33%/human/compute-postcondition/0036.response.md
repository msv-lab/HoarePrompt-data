Initial State: 
- `T` is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.
- `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are not both zero.
- `l` is not equal to `r`.
- `k` is positive.
- `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`.
- `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`.

Code:
```
a[r] -= mi
```

Impact of the code:
- `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` is reduced by `mi` and `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`; `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are not both zero; `l` is not equal to `r`; `k` is positive; `mi` is the minimum of the original `a[l]` and `a[r]`.**

Natural Language: 
`T`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The list `a` has `a[l]` reduced by `mi` and `a[r]` reduced by `mi`. The conditions that `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are not both zero, `l` is not equal to `r`, and `k` is positive remain valid. The value of `mi` remains the minimum of the original values of `a[l]` and `a[r]`.
