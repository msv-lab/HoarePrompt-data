Postcondition: **`l` is either 2 or 1, `r` is `r - 1` if `a[r]` was initially 0, otherwise `r` remains `n - 2` if `a[r]` was initially 0 or `n - 1` if `a[r]` was not initially 0, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `ans` is set to 4 if both `a[l]` and `a[r]` were initially 0, 3 if either `a[l]` or `a[r]` was initially 0, and 2 if neither `a[l]` nor `a[r]` was initially 0, `T` remains False, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`. If `a[l]` was initially 0, `l` is incremented by 1.**
