Initial State: `l` is 1 and `r` is at least 2, or `l` is 0 and `r` is at least 1, and `k` is greater than 0; `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`, where `mi` is the minimum value between the original `a[l]` and `a[r]`; `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`; `k` is reduced by `mi * 2`. If `a[l]` was initially 0, `l` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is incremented by 1; `ans` is incremented by 1.

Given the code snippet:
```
r -= 1
```

The value of `r` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged unless they were affected by operations not shown in this code snippet.

Output State: **`l` is 1 and `r` is at least 1, or `l` is 0 and `r` is at least 0, and `k` is greater than 0; `a[l]` has been reduced by `mi`, `a[r]` has been reduced by `mi`, `k` has been reduced by `mi * 2`, and `ans` has been incremented by 1. If `a[l]` was initially 0, `l` has been incremented by 1 and `ans` has been incremented by 1.**

In natural language, after executing the code, `r` is decreased by 1. The values of `l`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, `k`, and `ans` reflect the changes described in the initial state, with `r` being at least 1 if `l` was 1, or at least 0 if `l` was 0.
