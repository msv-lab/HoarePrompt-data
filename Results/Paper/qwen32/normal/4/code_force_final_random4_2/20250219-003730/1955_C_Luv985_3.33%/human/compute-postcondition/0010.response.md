The code assigns the value `n - 1` to the variable `r`. The values of `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`.**
