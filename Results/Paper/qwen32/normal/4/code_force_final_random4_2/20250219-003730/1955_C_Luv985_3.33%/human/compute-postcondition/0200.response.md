Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `l` is less than `r` or `r - 1` if `a[r]` was 0, `a` is the list with updated integer values, `mi` is recalculated as the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and `ans` may have been incremented. If `mi * 2 <= k`, `a[l]` and `a[r]` are decreased by `mi`, `k` is updated to `k - mi * 2`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `a[r]` was 0. If `a[l]` was 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 and `l` is increased by 1. If `mi * 2 > k`, `t` is `k % 2`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
