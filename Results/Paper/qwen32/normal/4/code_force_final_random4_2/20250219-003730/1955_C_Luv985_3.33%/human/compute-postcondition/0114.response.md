Postcondition: **`l` is either 1 or 0, `r` is `n - 2` if `a[r]` is 0, otherwise `r` is `n - 1`, `k` is greater than 0, `T` remains False, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, `t` is `k % 2`. If `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is set to 3 if both `a[l]` and `a[r]` are 0, 2 if either `a[l]` or `a[r]` is 0, and 1 if neither `a[l]` nor `a[r]` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` retains its original value.**
