To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the condition provided.

### Initial State:
- `l` is the final left index.
- `r` is the final right index.
- `k` is the remaining value.
- `ans` is the total number of elements reduced to zero.
- The condition `if k >= a[l]` is used to increment `ans` by 1.

### Analysis:
- The variable `ans` is initially described as the total number of elements reduced to zero.
- The condition `if k >= a[l]` checks if the remaining value `k` is greater than or equal to the element at the final left index `l` in the list `a`.
- If the condition is true, `ans` is incremented by 1.

### Output:
Since the exact values of `l`, `r`, `k`, and `ans` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the information given, we can describe the output in terms of the variables.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans` after the condition has been evaluated and potentially incremented.

### Final Answer:
Output: **ans (where ans is the total number of elements reduced to zero, incremented by 1 if k >= a[l])**
