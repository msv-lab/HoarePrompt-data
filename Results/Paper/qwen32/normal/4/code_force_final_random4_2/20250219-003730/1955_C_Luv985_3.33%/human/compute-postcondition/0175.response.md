Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is decreased by `mi * 2`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n-1`, `a` is the list with updated integer values where `a[0]` is decreased by `mi` and `a[n-1]` is further decreased by `mi`, `mi` is recalculated as the minimum of the updated `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `ans` is incremented by 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previously described states and values.
