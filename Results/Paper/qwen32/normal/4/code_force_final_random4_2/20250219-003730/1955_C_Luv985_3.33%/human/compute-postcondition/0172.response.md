The value of `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`. Given that `r` is `n-1`, `a[n-1]` is decreased by `mi`. The value of `mi` is the minimum of the updated `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` after `a[0]` has been decreased by `mi`. Therefore, the value of `a[n-1]` will be further adjusted based on this new `mi`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n-1`, `a` is the list with updated integer values where `a[0]` is decreased by `mi` and `a[n-1]` is further decreased by `mi`, `mi` is recalculated as the minimum of the updated `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`.**
