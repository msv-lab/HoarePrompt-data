Postcondition: **T is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10^4; n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; k is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15 and k is now k - mi * 2; a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, specifically a[0] is a[0] - mi and a[n-1] is a[n-1] - mi; l is 1 if a[0] was 0, otherwise l is 0; r is n - 1; ans is 1 if a[0] was 0, otherwise ans is 0; mi is min(a[0], a[n-1]) and mi * 2 <= k; the current value of a[l] is unchanged; a[r] is 0.**
