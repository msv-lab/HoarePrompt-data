To determine the output state, we need to understand the structure of the `pos` list. The `pos` list is constructed with `removals + 1` elements. The first element is `s - 2 * n`, and the subsequent `removals` elements are calculated as `s_final - 2 * n_final`.

Given that `s` is `s_final` and `n` is `n_final`, the first element of `pos` is `s_final - 2 * n_final`. The remaining `removals` elements are also `s_final - 2 * n_final`.

Since all elements in `pos` are the same (`s_final - 2 * n_final`), the maximum value in `pos` will be `s_final - 2 * n_final`.

Output State: **The program returns the value `s_final - 2 * n_final`**.
