### Reasoning:

The given Python program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. The `func_1` function is the main function that reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the result. The `func_2` function is responsible for calculating the optimal sum of the array after Alice and Bob perform their respective operations.

Let's break down the logic of both functions:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x`, which represent the number of elements in the array, the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, and the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, respectively.
   - Reads the array `a` of `n` integers.
   - Sorts the array `a`.
   - Calls `func_2` with the parameters `k`, `x`, and `a` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - If `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3, it returns 0. This is a hardcoded condition that does not align with the problem's logic and seems to be an error.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the possible sums after Alice and Bob perform their operations:
     - `s` is the sum of all elements in the array.
     - `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the sorted array (which are the largest elements).
     - `pos` is a list that stores the possible sums after different numbers of removals by Alice.
     - For each possible number of removals `i` (from 0 to `removals`), it updates `s` by subtracting the `i-th` largest element and updates `n` by adjusting for the new largest elements that Bob can flip.
     - It appends the calculated sum to the `pos` list.
   - Returns the maximum value from the `pos` list.

### Issues Identified:
- The hardcoded condition `if (removals == 6 and negatives == 3): return 0` is incorrect and does not align with the problem's logic. This condition will always return 0 for the specific case where `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3, regardless of the actual values in the array. This will lead to incorrect results for these specific input values.
- The logic for calculating the possible sums after removals and flips seems correct, but the hardcoded condition overrides the correct logic for the specific case mentioned.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the hardcoded condition in `func_2` that returns 0 for a specific case without considering the actual array values.

**Correctness: False**
