Reasoning:  
The provided program logic and the annotated states suggest that the program is intended to calculate the optimal sum of the array after both Alice and Bob have made their moves. However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of `func_2`. The function includes a hardcoded condition that returns 0 when `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3, which is not a general solution and does not align with the problem's requirements. This hardcoded condition will cause incorrect results for other test cases where `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3, and it will bypass the correct logic for other cases.

The correct approach should involve:
1. Sorting the array.
2. Considering all possible numbers of elements Alice can remove (from 0 to `k`).
3. For each possible number of elements removed, calculating the sum of the remaining elements and then determining the optimal number of elements Bob can flip to minimize the sum.
4. Tracking the maximum possible sum after both players have made their optimal moves.

Given the hardcoded condition, the program cannot be considered correct for all possible test cases.

Correctness: **False**
