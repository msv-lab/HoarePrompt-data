Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all the cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_2` contains a hardcoded condition that only returns `0` for a specific combination of `removals` and `negatives` (when `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3`), which is not a general solution. This hardcoded condition does not address the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob in all scenarios.

Here's a brief explanation of the issues and how the program should be corrected:

1. **Hardcoded Condition**: The function `func_2` has a condition that returns `0` for `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3`. This is not a general solution and does not handle all possible inputs correctly.

2. **Optimal Strategy**: Alice should remove the smallest elements first to maximize the sum. Bob should then flip the smallest remaining elements to negative to minimize the sum. The program needs to reflect this strategy.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - Sort the array.
   - Alice removes up to `k` smallest elements.
   - Bob flips up to `x` smallest remaining elements to negative.
   - Calculate the final sum based on these operations.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        # Alice removes up to k smallest elements
        if k > 0:
            a = a[k:]
        
        # Bob flips up to x smallest remaining elements
        if x > 0:
            for i in range(min(x, len(a))):
                if a[i] < 0:
                    a[i] *= -1
                else:
                    break
        
        # Calculate the final sum
        print(sum(a))

func_1()
```

This corrected version handles the problem correctly by implementing the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob.
