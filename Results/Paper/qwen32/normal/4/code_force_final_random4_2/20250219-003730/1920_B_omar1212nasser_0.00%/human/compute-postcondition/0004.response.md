`s` is assigned the value of the sum of the `elements` list. The values of `removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, and `pos` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is an empty list, and `s` is the sum of the `elements` list.

Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is an empty list, `s` is the sum of the `elements` list.**
