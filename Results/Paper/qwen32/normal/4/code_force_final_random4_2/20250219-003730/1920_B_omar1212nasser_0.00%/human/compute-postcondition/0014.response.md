The code snippet `s -= elements[-i]` will subtract the element at the index `-i` from `s`. Given that `i` is 2, it will subtract `elements[-2]` from `s`.

Output State: **`removals` is 2, `s` is `s - elements[-i] - elements[-2]`, `n` is `n + elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` if no `IndexError` occurs, otherwise `n` is 0, `pos` has an additional element `s - 2 * n`, `i` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is: `removals` remains 2, `s` is now `s - elements[-2]` (since `s` was previously `s - elements[-i]` and `i` is 2), `n` remains the same if no `IndexError` occurs, otherwise it becomes 0, `pos` has an additional element `s - 2 * n`, and `i` remains 2.
