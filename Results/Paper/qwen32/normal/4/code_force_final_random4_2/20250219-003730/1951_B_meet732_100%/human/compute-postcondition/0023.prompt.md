Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers where the first element is `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n), and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, with all `a_i`'s being distinct. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5; `x` is the value of the `k`-th element in the current test case list within `a`; `ind` is an empty list; `c` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] > x:
        ind.append(i)
        c += 1
    if c == 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers where the first element is `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n), and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, with all `a_i`'s being distinct. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `x` is the value of the `k`-th element in the current test case list within `a`. If `c` is 2, then `ind` is a list containing the index `i` where `a[i]` is greater than `x`. Otherwise, `ind` remains an empty list and `c` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of integers where the first element is `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n), and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, with all `a_i`'s being distinct. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `x` is the value of the `k`-th element in the current test case list within `a`. `ind` is a list containing the indices `i` where `a[i]` is greater than `x` and includes the current value of `i` up to the point where `c` was incremented to 2 or the loop was terminated. `i` is the index of the element that was being processed when the loop was terminated. If `c` equals 2, the loop is terminated by the `break` statement. Otherwise, the loop continues until `i` reaches `n`. If `a[i] > x`, `c` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `c` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers where the first element is `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n), and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, with all `a_i`'s being distinct. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `x` is the value of the `k`-th element in the current test case list within `a`. `ind` is a list containing the indices `i` where `a[i]` is greater than `x` and includes the current value of `i` up to the point where `c` was incremented to 2 or the loop was terminated. If `c` equals 2, the loop is terminated. Otherwise, the loop continues until `i` reaches `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
