The code snippet `x = a[k]` assigns the value of the `k`-th element of the list `a` to the variable `x`. Given the initial state, `a` is a list where the first element is `t`, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of `n` integers, and `k` is an index within these integers.

The value of `x` will be the `k`-th element from the start of the current test case list within `a`. Since the first element of `a` is `t`, the first test case starts at index 1, the second test case starts at index 1 + 2n1 (where `n1` is the number of integers in the first test case), and so on. However, the exact position of the `k`-th element in `a` depends on the specific structure of `a` and the value of `k` for each test case.

The output state will include the new value of `x` and retain all other parts of the initial state that remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where the first element is `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n), and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, with all `a_i`'s being distinct. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5; `x` is the value of the `k`-th element in the current test case list within `a`.**
