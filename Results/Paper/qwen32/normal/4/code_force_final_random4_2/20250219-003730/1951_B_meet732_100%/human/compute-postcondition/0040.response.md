Given the initial state, `ind` is a list of two indices, and we know that `ind[0]` is not 0, and `k` is greater than `ind[1]`. We need to calculate the return value of `max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])`.

Since `ind` has a length of 2, let's denote `ind[0]` as `i` and `ind[1]` as `j`. We know that `i` is not 0 and `k > j`. The return value will be the maximum of `i - 1` and `j - i`.

Given that `i` is not 0, `i - 1` is a valid calculation. Also, since `j` is the second index and `i` is the first index, `j - i` is a positive number or zero.

Therefore, the return value will be the maximum of `i - 1` and `j - i`. Since `j > i`, `j - i` is positive and thus will be greater than or equal to `i - 1` unless `i - 1` is also positive and greater, but given the constraints, `j - i` is the more likely candidate to be the maximum.

Output State: **The program returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`, which is `ind[1] - ind[0]` given the constraints.**
