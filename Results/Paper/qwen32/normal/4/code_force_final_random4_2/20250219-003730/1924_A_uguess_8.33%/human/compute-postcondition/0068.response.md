Postcondition: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `tmp`, and `ans` remain unchanged. `cnt` is `1` if `cur` was updated to `(1 << k) - 1` before the operation; otherwise, `cnt` remains `0`. `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. If `cur & (1 << cur_ss) == 0`, then `cur` is its previous value plus `2` else `cur` remains unchanged.**
