The variable `tmp` is assigned the value `chr(ord('a') + i)`, which converts the ASCII value of 'a' plus the current value of `i` into a character. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `cur` remain unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1; `tmp` is `chr(ord('a') + i)`**.
