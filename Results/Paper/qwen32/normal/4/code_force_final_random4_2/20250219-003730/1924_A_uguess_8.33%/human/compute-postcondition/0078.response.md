Postcondition: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `tmp`, `ans` remain unchanged; `cur` is `0` and `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `cur` was `(1 << k) - 1` before the if statement; otherwise, `cur` and `cnt` remain as per the conditions specified in the precondition. `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')` and `ss` is the next character in the string `s`.**
