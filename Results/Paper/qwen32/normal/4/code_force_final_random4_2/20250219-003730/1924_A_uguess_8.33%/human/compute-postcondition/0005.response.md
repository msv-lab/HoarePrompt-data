The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `cur` to 0. This does not affect the values of the previously defined variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, or `cnt`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is the string read from the input; `cnt` is 0; `cur` is 0.**
