Postcondition: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `tmp`, and `ans` remain unchanged. If `cur` was updated to `(1 << k) - 1` before the operation, `cnt` is `2`; otherwise, `cnt` is `1`. `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. If `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is reset to `0`; otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.**
