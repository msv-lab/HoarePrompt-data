Postcondition: **`t` remains unchanged, `n`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the loop. `s` remains unchanged as it is only read, not modified. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `cnt` is incremented each time a subset of `k` distinct characters is found in sequence, and `cur` will be 0 if the last processed subset of `k` distinct characters completed a sequence, or it will be a value reflecting the bits of the characters processed since the last completed sequence. Otherwise, `cnt` remains unchanged, `cur` remains unchanged, `i` is set to `k`, `tmp` is set to the character `chr(ord('a') + (k-1))`, and `ans` is updated to `ans + chr(ord('a') + (k-1)) + 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)`**.
