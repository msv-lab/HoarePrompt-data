The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments `cur` by `2` raised to the power of `cur_ss`. Given that `cur_ss` is the position of the third element of `s` in the alphabet, we can calculate the new value of `cur` based on the initial value of `cur` and `cur_ss`.

The initial value of `cur` is 0 if it was not equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise, it remains `(1 << k) - 1`. After the operation, `cur` will be `1 << cur_ss` if it was initially 0, or `cur + (1 << cur_ss)` if it was not 0.

The other variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `tmp`, `i`, `ans`, `cnt` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `tmp`, `i`, `ans` remain the same as their initial values; `cnt` is 0 if `cur` was not equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cnt` is 1; `cur_ss` is the position of the third element of `s` in the alphabet; `cur` is `cur + (1 << cur_ss)` if it was not 0, otherwise `cur` is `1 << cur_ss`; `ss` is the third element of `s`.**
