Output State: **t remains unchanged, n remains unchanged, k remains unchanged, m remains unchanged, s remains unchanged, cnt remains unchanged, cur remains unchanged, i is k, tmp is chr(ord('a') + (k-1)), ans is ans + chr(ord('a') + (k-1)).**

In simple terms, the variable `ans` has been updated to include the character represented by `tmp`, which is `chr(ord('a') + (k-1))`. All other variables remain unchanged.
