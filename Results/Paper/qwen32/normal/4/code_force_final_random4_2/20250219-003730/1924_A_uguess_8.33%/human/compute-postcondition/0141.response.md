The code snippet assigns the value of `chr(ord('a') + i)` to the variable `tmp`. This means `tmp` will now hold the character at position `i` in the alphabet. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k` must be greater than 0, `m`, `s`, `cur`, `cnt` remain unchanged; `cur_ss` is the position of the last character in `s` in the alphabet. If `cur & 1 << i == 0`, `tmp` is the character at position `i` in the alphabet. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string. `ans` is a string consisting of the character at position `k-1` in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times, `i` is `i + 1`. `tmp` is the character at position `i` in the alphabet.**
