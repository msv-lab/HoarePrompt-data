The code snippet reads a string input and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `s` along with the unchanged values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `m`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is the string read from the input.**
