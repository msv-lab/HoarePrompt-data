The given `print` statement is:

```python
print('NO')
```

The initial state description provides information about several variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `tmp`, `i`, `ans`, `cur`, `cnt`, `cur_ss`) and their relationships, but none of these variables are directly involved in the `print` statement. The `print` statement explicitly outputs the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **NO**
