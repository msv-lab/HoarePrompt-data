The only variable in the loop head is `ss`, which iterates over the list `s`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `ss` to the next element in the list `s`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `tmp`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The variable `cnt` is 0 if `cur` is not equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cnt` is 1. The variable `cur_ss` is 2, and `cur` is 0 if it was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cur` remains the same.

Since `cur_ss` is 2, it indicates that the previous iteration used the second element of `s`. Therefore, for the next iteration, `ss` should be the third element of `s`.

State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `tmp`, `i`, `ans` remain the same as their initial values; `cnt` is 0 if `cur` is not equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cnt` is 1; `cur_ss` is 3; `cur` is 0 if it was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cur` remains the same as its initial value; `ss` is the third element of `s`**
