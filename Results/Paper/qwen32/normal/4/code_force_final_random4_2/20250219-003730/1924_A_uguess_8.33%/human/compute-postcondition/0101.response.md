The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and its relationship with `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has not yet reached `t` because the loop is continuing. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cur`, and `tmp` remain the same as their initial values. `cnt` is the total number of times the first `k` bits in `cur` were all set to `1`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `cur` is `0` if the last `k`-bit sequence was complete, otherwise it holds the value of the incomplete sequence. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `i` is equal to `k`, `tmp` is the last character set in the loop or unchanged, and `ans` is updated to `ans + 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)`. `i` is incremented by 1**.
