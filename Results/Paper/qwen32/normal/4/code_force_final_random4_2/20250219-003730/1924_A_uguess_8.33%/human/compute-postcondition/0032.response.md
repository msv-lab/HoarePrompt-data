Postcondition: **`t` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop. `n`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the loop. `s` remains unchanged as it is only read, not modified. `cnt` is less than `n` and holds the number of times a sequence of `k` distinct characters was found in the string `s`. `cur` will be 0 if the last processed subset of `k` distinct characters completed a sequence, or it will be a value reflecting the bits of the characters processed since the last completed sequence.**
