The given code snippet only increments the variable `cnt` by 1. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `ss`, `cur_ss`, `cur`) are modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a string read from the input that must have at least 1 character; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`; `cur_ss` is an integer representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is updated to the previous value of `cur` plus \(2^{cur\_ss}\). Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged; `cnt` is incremented by 1.**
