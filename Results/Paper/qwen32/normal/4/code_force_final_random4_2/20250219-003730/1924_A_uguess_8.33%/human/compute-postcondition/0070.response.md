The code sets the value of `cur` to `0`. This change affects the `cur` variable directly, and all other variables remain unchanged. Since `cur` is now `0`, the condition `cur & (1 << cur_ss) == 0` will need to be re-evaluated in subsequent code, but for this snippet, only `cur` is modified.

Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `tmp`, and `ans` remain unchanged; `cnt` is `2` if `cur` was updated to `(1 << k) - 1` before the operation; otherwise, `cnt` is `1`; `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`; `cur` is `0`.**
