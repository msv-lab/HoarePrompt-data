Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a string read from the input that must have at least 1 character; `cnt` is 1; `cur_ss` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is set to `1 << cur_ss`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. The current value of `cur` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `cur` is explicitly set to 0 by the provided code snippet. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code.
