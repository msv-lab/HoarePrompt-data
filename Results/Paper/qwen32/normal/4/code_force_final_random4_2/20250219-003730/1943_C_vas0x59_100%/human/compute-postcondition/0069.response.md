Postcondition: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree structure; `d` is a list where `d[i]` is the shortest distance from vertex `a` to vertex `i` in the tree; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex `a` to each vertex in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path, starting with `b` and ending with `a`; `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c, i)` for `i` ranging from `0` to `ci` if the length of `path_ba` is odd, where `ci` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2` and `c` is the middle vertex of `path_ba`; if the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list containing 6 tuples, and `ci2` is `len(path_ba) // 2` and `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, with `c1` being `path_ba[ci1]` and `c2` being `path_ba[ci2]`.**
