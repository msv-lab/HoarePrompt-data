Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree structure; `d` is a list where `d[i]` is the shortest distance from vertex `a` to vertex `i` in the tree; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex `a` to each vertex in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path, starting with `b` and ending with `a`; `ops` is an empty list; the length of `path_ba` is even; `ci2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`; `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`; `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`; `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - ci1, 2):
    ops.append((c1, i))
    ops.append((c2, i))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree structure; `d` is a list where `d[i]` is the shortest distance from vertex `a` to vertex `i` in the tree; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex `a` to each vertex in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path, starting with `b` and ending with `a`, and must have at least 3 elements; `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c1, c2)` and the newly added tuple `(c2, i)`; the length of `path_ba` is even; `ci2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`; `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`; `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`; `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree structure; `d` is a list where `d[i]` is the shortest distance from vertex `a` to vertex `i` in the tree; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex `a` to each vertex in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path, starting with `b` and ending with `a`, and must have at least 3 elements; `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, c2)` and the newly added tuple `(c2, i)`, and the newly added tuple `(c1, i)`, and now also contains the newly added tuple `(c2, i)`; the length of `path_ba` is even; `ci2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`; `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`; `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`; `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`; `i` is `i + 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree structure; `d` is a list where `d[i]` is the shortest distance from vertex `a` to vertex `i` in the tree; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex `a` to each vertex in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path, starting with `b` and ending with `a`, and must have at least 3 elements; `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, c2)` and the newly added tuple `(c2, i)`, and the newly added tuple `(c1, i)`, and now also contains the newly added tuple `(c2, i)`; the length of `path_ba` is even; `ci2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`; `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`; `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`; `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`; `i` is `i + 4`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
