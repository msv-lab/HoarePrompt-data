To determine the output of `print(len(ops))`, we need to carefully analyze the description of the variables and their relationships provided in the initial state.

### Analysis:

1. **`u2vs`**: This is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree where `u2vs[i]` contains all vertices directly connected to vertex `i`.

2. **`d`**: This is a list where `d[i]` represents the shortest distance from vertex `a` to vertex `i`.

3. **`previous`**: This is a list where `previous[i]` contains the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex `a` to vertex `i`.

4. **`a`**: This is the result of `func_1(d)`. Since the exact function `func_1` is not provided, we can infer that `a` is likely a vertex (or possibly the vertex with the smallest distance from the starting vertex, if `func_1` is finding the vertex with the minimum distance).

5. **`b`**: This is also the result of `func_1(d)`. Given that `func_1` is likely the same function for both `a` and `b`, and without additional information, it's reasonable to assume that `a` and `b` could be the same vertex, but we must consider the possibility that they could be different.

6. **`path_ba`**: This is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path, starting with `b` and ending with `a`.

7. **`ops`**: This list is constructed based on the length of `path_ba`:
   - If `len(path_ba)` is odd, `ops` contains tuples `(c, i)` for `i` ranging from `0` to `ci`, where `ci` is `len(path_ba) // 2` and `c` is the middle vertex of `path_ba`.
   - If `len(path_ba)` is even, `ops` contains 6 tuples, and `ci2` is `len(path_ba) // 2` and `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, with `c1` being `path_ba[ci1]` and `c2` being `path_ba[ci2]`.

### Determining the Length of `ops`:

- **Odd Length of `path_ba`**:
  - If `len(path_ba)` is odd, `ops` will have `ci + 1` tuples, where `ci` is `len(path_ba) // 2`.
  - For example, if `len(path_ba)` is 5, `ci` is 2, and `ops` will have 3 tuples.

- **Even Length of `path_ba`**:
  - If `len(path_ba)` is even, `ops` will always have 6 tuples, regardless of the length of `path_ba`.

Since the exact length of `path_ba` is not provided, we need to consider both cases. However, the problem statement specifically asks for the length of `ops`, and based on the description, we can provide a precise output for both scenarios.

### Conclusion:

Given the two possible scenarios:
- If `len(path_ba)` is odd, `len(ops)` is `ci + 1`, where `ci` is `len(path_ba) // 2`.
- If `len(path_ba)` is even, `len(ops)` is 6.

Since we don't have the exact length of `path_ba`, we can't provide a single numerical value. However, we can describe the possible values based on the conditions.

Output: **len(ops) (where len(ops) is ci + 1 if len(path_ba) is odd, and 6 if len(path_ba) is even, with ci being len(path_ba) // 2)**
