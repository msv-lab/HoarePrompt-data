To determine the Output State, we need to understand the impact of the function call `a = func_1(d)`. Since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we can only infer that `a` will be assigned the value returned by `func_1` when called with `d` as its argument. The values of `u2vs` and `d` remain unchanged unless modified within `func_1`, which we cannot determine from the given information.

Therefore, the Output State will include `a` being assigned the result of `func_1(d)`, while `u2vs` and `d` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree structure; `d` is a list where `d[i]` is the shortest distance from vertex `0` to vertex `i` in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`**.
