To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the computation performed by the code snippet.

### Initial State Recap
- `u2vs`: A list of `n` lists where each inner list contains the vertices directly connected to a vertex `i` in the tree.
- `d`: A list where `d[i]` is the shortest distance from vertex `a` to vertex `i`.
- `previous`: A list that contains the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex `a` to each vertex.
- `a`: The result of `func_1(d)`.
- `b`: Also the result of `func_1(d)`.
- `path_ba`: A list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path.
- `ops`: A list of tuples `(c, i)` constructed based on the length of `path_ba`.

### Analysis of `ops`
- If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains one tuple `(c, i)` where `c` is the middle vertex of `path_ba` and `i` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`.
- If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains six tuples, but the exact structure isn't fully detailed in the initial state. However, we can infer that `ops` will contain tuples related to the middle vertices of `path_ba`.

### The Print Statement
The `print` statement uses `map` to apply a lambda function to each tuple in `ops`. The lambda function formats each tuple `(c, i)` into a string `f'{c + 1} {i}'`. The `+ 1` operation on `c` suggests that the vertices are 1-indexed for the output.

### Output Description
- If `path_ba` is odd in length, `ops` contains one tuple `(c, i)`. The output will be a single line in the format `c+1 i`.
- If `path_ba` is even in length, `ops` contains six tuples. The output will be six lines, each in the format `c+1 i`.

Since the exact values of `path_ba`, `ops`, and the results of `func_1(d)` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the structure of `ops`.

### Final Output
Output: **c+1 i (where c is the middle vertex of path_ba and i is the index len(path_ba) // 2) if path_ba is odd in length; otherwise, six lines each in the format c+1 i (where c and i are determined by the structure of ops for even length path_ba)**
