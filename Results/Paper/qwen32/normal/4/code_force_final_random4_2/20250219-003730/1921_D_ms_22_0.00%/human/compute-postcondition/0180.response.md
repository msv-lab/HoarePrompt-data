The code snippet adds a tuple to `max_heap` using `heapq.heappush`. The tuple is structured as `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`. Given that `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, the tuple being pushed to `max_heap` will be `(-abs(i - b[m - 1]), i, m - 1)`. This operation modifies `max_heap` by adding this new element.

The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element; `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `max_heap` is a list containing the tuple `(-abs(i - b[m - 1]), i, m - 1)`; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is 0; `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`; `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`; `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`**.
