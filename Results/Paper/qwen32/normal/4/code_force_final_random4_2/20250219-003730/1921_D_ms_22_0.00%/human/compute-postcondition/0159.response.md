The code snippet provided is `tp2 -= 1`. This code decrements the value of the variable `tp2` by 1. None of the other variables mentioned in the initial state are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input and must contain at least one element, `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple, `item` is the tuple with the smallest absolute difference that was popped from `max_heap`, `ans` is `ans - item[0]`, `tp2` is decreased by 1.**
