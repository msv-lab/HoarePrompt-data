The given code snippet pushes a tuple into a heap called `max_heap`. The tuple includes the negative of `diff2`, the current element `i` from list `a`, and the index `m - 1`.

Since `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` is being pushed into `max_heap`, the value of `max_heap` will be updated to include this new tuple.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `i`, `diff1`, `diff2`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the next element in the list `a` (i.e., the element after the current `i`), `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, `max_heap` includes the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`**.
