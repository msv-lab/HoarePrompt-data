The code snippet provided sets the variable `ans` to 0. This overwrites the previous value of `ans`, which was the sum of the minimum distances required to match each element of `a` with elements of `b`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input; `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `max_heap` is an empty list; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is 0.**
