The code snippet pushes a tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` onto a max heap named `max_heap`. This operation does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `i`, `diff1`, or `diff2`. It only modifies the state of `max_heap` by adding the new tuple.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and must have at least one element; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is 0; `i` is `i_next`, where `i_next` is the next element in the list `a`; `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`; `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`; `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`**.
