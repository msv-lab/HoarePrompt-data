The given code snippet pushes a tuple into the `max_heap` using the `heapq.heappush` function. The tuple being pushed is `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`. This operation does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `diff1`, or `diff2`. It only modifies the `max_heap` by adding the new tuple to it.

Since `diff1` and `diff2` were used to determine the initial state of `max_heap`, and the code snippet explicitly pushes `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` into `max_heap`, the `max_heap` will now contain at least two elements: the initial tuple and the newly pushed tuple.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input and must have at least one integer, `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, `max_heap` contains at least two elements: `[(-diff1, i, 0), (-diff2, i, m - 1)]` if `diff1` was initially greater than `diff2`, or `[(-diff2, i, m - 1), (-diff2, i, m - 1)]` if `diff1` was initially less than or equal to `diff2`.**
