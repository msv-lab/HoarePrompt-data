Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input, `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input, `max_heap` is a list containing tuples `(-diff1, i, 0)` or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` for each element in `a`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0.**

In simple terms, after the loop has executed for all iterations, the state will be as follows:
- The variable `t` will have been decremented by 1.
- `n` and `m` will retain their initial values from the input.
- `a` will still be the list of integers obtained from the input.
- `b` will still be the sorted version of the list `a`.
- `tp1` will remain 0, and `tp2` will remain `m - 1`.
- `ans` will still be 0.
- `max_heap` will contain a tuple for each element in `a`, where each tuple consists of the negative of the larger difference between the element and the smallest or largest element in `b`, the element itself, and the index (0 or `m - 1`) of the element in `b` that was used to compute the difference.
