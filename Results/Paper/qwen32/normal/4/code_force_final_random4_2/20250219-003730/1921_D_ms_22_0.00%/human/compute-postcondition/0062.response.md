The code snippet `ans += -item[0]` modifies the value of `ans` by adding the negative of `item[0]` to it. Given that `item` is a tuple of the form `(-diff, i, index)`, the value `-item[0]` is equivalent to `diff`. Therefore, `ans` is increased by `diff`.

Here is the detailed breakdown of the output state:

- `t` remains an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `m` remains an integer obtained from the split input.
- `a` remains a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one element.
- `b` remains a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input.
- `max_heap` remains a list containing tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)` for each element `i` in `a`, with one element removed.
- `item` remains the tuple with the largest `diff` value from the original `max_heap`.
- `tp1` and `tp2` remain unchanged based on the conditions described in the initial state.
- `ans` is now the original value of `ans` plus `diff`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is an integer obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one element; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `max_heap` is a list containing tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)` for each element `i` in `a`, with one element removed; `item` is the tuple with the largest `diff` value from the original `max_heap`; `tp1` and `tp2` are unchanged; `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `diff`.**
