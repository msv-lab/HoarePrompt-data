The code snippet pushes a tuple into a max heap named `max_heap`. The tuple consists of the negative of `diff2`, the value of `i`, and `m - 1`. This operation affects the state of `max_heap` by adding this new tuple to it. The values of other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `i`, `diff1`, `diff2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element; `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is 0; `i` is the next element in the list `a`; `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`; `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1]); `max_heap` contains the new tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`**.
