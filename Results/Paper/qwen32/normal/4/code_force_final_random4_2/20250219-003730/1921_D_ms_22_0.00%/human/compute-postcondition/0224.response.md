The code snippet `ans += -item[0]` modifies the value of `ans` by adding the positive value of `max_diff` (which is the negation of `item[0]`).

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0 and remains unchanged.
- `n` and `m` are integers provided as input and remain unchanged.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input and remains unchanged.
- `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order, and remains unchanged.
- `max_heap` is not empty and contains at least one tuple of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)` except the one that was popped, and remains unchanged.
- `item` is a tuple of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)` that was popped from `max_heap` and remains unchanged.
- `ans` is a variable that will be updated.

The value of `ans` is increased by `-item[0]`, which is `max_diff`. Therefore, `ans` will have its previous value plus `max_diff`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `max_heap` is not empty and contains at least one tuple of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)` except the one that was popped; `item` is a tuple of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)` that was popped from `max_heap`; `ans` is increased by `max_diff`.**
