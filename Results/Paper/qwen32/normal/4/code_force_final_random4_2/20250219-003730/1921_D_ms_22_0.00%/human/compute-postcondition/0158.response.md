The code snippet provided is `tp1 += 1`, which increments the value of `tp1` by 1. However, `tp1` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we can assume that `tp1` was not previously defined or used in the given context. Since `tp1` is not part of the initial state, it is introduced and set to 1 by this operation.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, `item`, and `ans`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input and must contain at least one element, `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple, `item` is the tuple with the smallest absolute difference that was popped from `max_heap`, `ans` is `ans - item[0]`, `tp1` is 1.**
