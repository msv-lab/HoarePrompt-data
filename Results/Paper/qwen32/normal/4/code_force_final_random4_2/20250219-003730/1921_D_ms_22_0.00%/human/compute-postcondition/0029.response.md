The given code snippet pushes a tuple into a heap named `max_heap`. The tuple consists of the negative of `diff1`, the value of `i`, and `0`. This operation modifies the `max_heap` by adding the new tuple, but it does not affect the values of the other variables directly.

Here are the variables and their states before and after the code execution:
- `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99. (No change)
- `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the split input. (No change)
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and must have at least one element. (No change)
- `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input. (No change)
- `tp1` is 0. (No change)
- `tp2` is `m - 1`. (No change)
- `ans` is 0. (No change)
- `i` is the next element in the list `a` after `i_next`. (No change)
- `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`. (No change)
- `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`. (No change)
- `max_heap` is modified by adding the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and must have at least one element; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is 0; `i` is the next element in the list `a` after `i_next`; `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`; `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`; `max_heap` includes the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`**.
