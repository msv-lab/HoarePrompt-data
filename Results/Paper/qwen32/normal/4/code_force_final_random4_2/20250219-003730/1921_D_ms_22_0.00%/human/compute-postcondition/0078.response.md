The code `tp2 -= 1` decrements the value of `tp2` by 1. Other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is an integer obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one element; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `max_heap` contains at least one element but does not include the tuple with the largest `diff` value from the original `max_heap`; `item` is the tuple with the smallest `diff` value from the original `max_heap`; `ans` is updated by subtracting the first element of `item`; `tp2` is decreased by 1.**
