The code snippet pushes a tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` onto a heap named `max_heap`. This action modifies the `max_heap` by adding the new tuple, but it does not affect any of the other variables directly.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element; `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is 0; `i` is the next element in the list `a`; `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`; `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`; `max_heap` includes the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`**.
