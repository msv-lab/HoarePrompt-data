The code snippet provided is `max_heap = []`. This line reassigns the `max_heap` variable to an empty list. None of the other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input; `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `max_heap` is an empty list; `tp1` is equal to `m` (all elements of `b` have been used from the lower end); `tp2` is -1 (all elements of `b` have been used from the upper end); `ans` is the sum of the minimum distances required to match each element of `a` with elements of `b`.**
