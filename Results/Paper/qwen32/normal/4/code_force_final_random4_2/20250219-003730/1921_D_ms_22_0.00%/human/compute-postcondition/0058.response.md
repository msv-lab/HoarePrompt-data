The code snippet `ans += diff1` increments the variable `ans` by the value of `diff1`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, `item`, `diff1`, `diff2`, `tp1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is an integer obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one element; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `max_heap` is a list containing tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)` for each element `i` in `a`, with one element removed; `item` is the tuple with the largest `diff` value from the original `max_heap`; `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`; `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`; `tp1` is incremented by 1; `ans` is increased by `diff1`.**
