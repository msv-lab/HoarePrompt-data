The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the list `a`. Therefore, we can only adjust the state of `i` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99.
- `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the split input.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and must have at least one element.
- `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input.
- `tp1` is 0.
- `tp2` is `m - 1`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `i` is `i_next`, where `i_next` is the next element in the list `a`.
- `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`.
- `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`.
- If `diff1` > `diff2`, `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`. Otherwise, `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be updated to the next element in the list `a`. Since `i` is currently `i_next`, the next iteration should set `i` to the subsequent element in `a`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and must have at least one element; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is 0; `i` is the next element in the list `a` after `i_next`; `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`; `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`. Otherwise, `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`**.

However, since `diff1`, `diff2`, and the contents of `max_heap` depend on the value of `i`, they should be recalculated in the next iteration. Therefore, the precise values of `diff1`, `diff2`, and `max_heap` are not specified in the state at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and must have at least one element; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is 0; `i` is the next element in the list `a` after `i_next`**.
