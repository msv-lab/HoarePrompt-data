Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is an integer obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one element; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `max_heap` is an empty list; `tp1` is equal to `m` (all elements of `b` have been used from the lower end); `tp2` is -1 (all elements of `b` have been used from the upper end); `ans` is the sum of the minimum distances required to match each element of `a` with elements of `b`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the `max_heap` is empty, meaning all elements from `a` have been processed. The pointers `tp1` and `tp2` have moved such that `tp1` has reached the end of `b` from the lower end, and `tp2` has moved to just before the start of `b` from the upper end. The variable `ans` holds the total minimum distance sum required to match each element of `a` with an element of `b`.
