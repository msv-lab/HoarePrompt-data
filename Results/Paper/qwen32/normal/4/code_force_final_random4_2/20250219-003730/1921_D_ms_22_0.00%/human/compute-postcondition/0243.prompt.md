Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `max_heap` contains `n` tuples of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)` where `max_diff` is the maximum difference between `i` in `a` and either `b[0]` or `b[m - 1]`, `i` is an element from `a`, and `index_in_b` is either 0 or `m - 1`; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `max_heap` contains `n-1` tuples of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)`. If `item[2]` (index_in_b) is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `tp1` and `tp2` are updated based on the comparison of `diff1` and `diff2`, and `ans` is increased by either `diff1` or `diff2`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `max_diff`, and `tp1` and `tp2` are updated accordingly. `item` is the tuple with the largest `max_diff` value from the original `max_heap`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is greater than 0; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `max_heap` is not empty and contains at least one tuple of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)` except the one that was popped; `item` is a tuple of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)` that was popped from `max_heap`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `ans` is increased by the maximum of the absolute differences between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, or between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`, and `tp1` or `tp2` is adjusted accordingly. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `max_diff`, and either `tp1` is incremented by 1 or `tp2` is decreased by 1 depending on whether `item[2]` equals `tp1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is greater than 0; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `max_heap` is not empty and contains at least one tuple of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)`, but one element has been removed; `item` is the tuple of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)` that was at the root of `max_heap` before the pop operation; `ans` has been increased by either `diff1`, `diff2`, or `max_diff` depending on the condition; if `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, then `diff1` is calculated as `abs(item[1] - b[tp1 + 1])` if `diff1 > diff2`, otherwise `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`; `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`; `tp1` is incremented by 1 if `diff1 > diff2`, otherwise `tp1` remains the same; `tp2` is decreased by 1 if `diff1 <= diff2`, otherwise `tp2` remains the same; `ans` is increased by `diff1` if `diff1 > diff2`, otherwise `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` equals `tp1` or `tp2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, otherwise `tp2` is decreased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
