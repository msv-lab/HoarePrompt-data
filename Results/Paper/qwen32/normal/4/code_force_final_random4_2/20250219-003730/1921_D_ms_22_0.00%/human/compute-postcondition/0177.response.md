Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element; `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `max_heap` is an empty list; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is 0; `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])` and `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`; `diff1` is greater than `diff2`**
