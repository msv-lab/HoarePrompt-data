Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input and must contain at least one element, `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple, `item` is the tuple with the smallest absolute difference that was popped from `max_heap`. If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, then `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `tp1` is `tp1 + 1` and `ans` is `ans + diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is `tp2 - 1` and `ans` is `ans + diff2`. If `item[2]` is not less than `tp1` and not greater than `tp2`, then `ans` is `ans - item[0]`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, no further changes are made. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.**
