The code calculates the absolute difference between the second element of the tuple `item` and the element at index `tp1` in the list `b`. This value is assigned to the variable `diff1`. 

The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, and `item` remain unchanged by this operation as they are not modified in the given code snippet. 

The new variable `diff1` is introduced with the calculated value.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input and must contain at least one element, `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple, `item` is the tuple with the smallest absolute difference that was popped from `max_heap`, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`**.
