Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `max_heap` is not empty and contains at least one tuple of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)` except the one that was popped; `item` is a tuple of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)` that was popped from `max_heap`; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff2`.**
