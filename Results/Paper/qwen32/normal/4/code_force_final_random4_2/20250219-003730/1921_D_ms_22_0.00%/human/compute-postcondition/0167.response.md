The code reads a line of input, splits it into substrings, converts each substring to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
