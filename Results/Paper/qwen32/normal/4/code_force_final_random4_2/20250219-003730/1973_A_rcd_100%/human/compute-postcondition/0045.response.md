The code snippet provided is a `break` statement, which will exit the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. However, since there is no loop or conditional block in the provided context, the `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. `x` is 0; `y` is `p3`. Additionally, `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`.**
