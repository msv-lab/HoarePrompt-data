The value of `y` is decremented by 1. Since `y` was initially equal to `p3`, after the operation, `y` becomes `p3 - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`. `x` is 1 and `y` is `p3 - 1`.**
