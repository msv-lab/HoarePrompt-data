Let's break down the problem step by step using the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
- The current value of `x` is 0.
- The current value of `y` is `p3`.
- `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(p1 - x + p3)
```
Given that `x` is 0, the expression simplifies to:
```python
print(p1 + p3)
```

### Determining the Output:
- `p1` and `p3` are integers read from the input.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
- `p1 - x` (which is `p1` since `x` is 0) is less than or equal to `p2 - y` (which is `p2 - p3` since `y` is `p3`).

From the above, we know:
- `p1` and `p3` are specific integers, but their exact values are not provided.
- The condition `p1 + p2 + p3` is odd means the sum of these three integers results in an odd number.
- `p3 < p1 + p2` ensures that `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

Since the exact values of `p1` and `p3` are not given, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **p1 + p3 (where p1 and p3 are integers read from the input such that p1 + p2 + p3 is odd and p3 < p1 + p2)**
