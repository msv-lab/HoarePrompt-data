Let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state to determine the output of the `print` statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` must be greater than 1 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `p3` must be at least 1.
- There is a nested loop or condition involving variables `x` and `y`:
  - If `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, the loop or condition breaks.
  - Otherwise, `x` is increased by 1 and `y` is decreased by 1.
  - `y` must be greater than or equal to `x`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(p1 - x + p3)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables `x` and `y`**:
   - The values of `x` and `y` are adjusted within the loop/condition.
   - The loop breaks when `p1 - x <= p2 - y`.
   - `x` starts at some value and increases, while `y` starts at some value and decreases.
   - The exact values of `x` and `y` depend on the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y`**:
   - This condition determines when the loop or if statement breaks.
   - When the condition is met, the current values of `x` and `y` are used in the `print` statement.

3. **Expression `p1 - x + p3`**:
   - This expression is evaluated after the loop breaks.
   - The value of `x` at the point of breaking the loop is crucial for the final result.

### Determining the Output:
- Since the exact values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `x` and `y`.
- However, we know that the loop breaks when `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, so the final value of `x` is the point where this condition is first satisfied.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the value of `p1 - x + p3` where `x` is the value at which the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is first met.

Output: **p1 - x + p3 (where x is the value at which p1 - x <= p2 - y is first met)**
