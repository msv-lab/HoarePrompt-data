The given Python code snippet is:

```python
print(-1)
```

The initial state provides several conditions and variable definitions:
- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.

However, the `print` statement in the code snippet does not depend on any of these variables or conditions. It directly prints the integer `-1`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply `-1`.

Output: **-1**
