The code snippet provided is `t = int(input())`. This line reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500 is established by this input operation.

Output State: **Each test case consists of three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players sorted in non-decreasing order. The number of test cases t is an input integer.**
