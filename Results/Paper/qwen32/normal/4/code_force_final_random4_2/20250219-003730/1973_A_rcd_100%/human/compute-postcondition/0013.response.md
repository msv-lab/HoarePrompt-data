Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`. The current value of `x` is 0 and the current value of `y` is `p3`. Additionally, `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`.**
