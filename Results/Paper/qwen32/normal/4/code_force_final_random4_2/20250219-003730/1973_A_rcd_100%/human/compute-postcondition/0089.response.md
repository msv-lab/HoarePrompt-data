The value of `x` is incremented by 1. Since `x` was initially either 1 or 2, after the increment, `x` will be either 2 or 3. The values of `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `y` remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` is greater than 0, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `p3` is non-negative, and `y` must be at least `x` still holds. The only change is that `x` is now either 2 or 3.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `p3` is non-negative, `x` is either 2 or 3, and `y` must be at least `x`.**
