Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
We need to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred in a series of chess games among three players, given their final scores. The scores are provided in non-decreasing order, and we must ensure that the scores are consistent with a valid set of games.

### Key Points:
1. **Total Points**: The sum of all points must be even because each game awards a total of 2 points (either 2-0 or 1-1).
2. **Score Constraints**:
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2` because the third player could have drawn all their games with the other two players.
   - Otherwise, we need to find a feasible distribution of wins and draws that matches the scores.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and each test case's scores.
2. **Total Points Check**: The program checks if the sum of the scores is even. If not, it prints `-1` because the scores cannot be consistent with any set of games.
3. **Direct Draw Calculation**:
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the program prints `p1 + p2` as the maximum number of draws. This is correct because the third player could have drawn all their games with the other two players.
4. **Iterative Calculation**:
   - If `p3 < p1 + p2`, the program uses a loop to find the maximum number of draws.
   - It initializes `x` (number of losses for player 1) and `y` (number of wins for player 3) and iteratively adjusts these values.
   - The condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` ensures that the remaining points for player 1 and player 2 are consistent with the remaining games.
   - If the condition is met, it prints `p1 - x + p3` as the maximum number of draws.
   - If no valid distribution is found, it defaults to printing `p3`.

### Issues in the Program:
- The default case in the loop (`else: print(p3)`) is incorrect. If no valid distribution is found, the program should print `-1` instead of `p3`.
- The loop logic might not cover all edge cases correctly. For instance, it might not handle scenarios where the scores are not achievable with any combination of wins and draws.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the program, we need to ensure that the default case correctly handles invalid score distributions:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            x = 0
            y = p3
            found = False
            while y >= x:
                if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
                    print(p1 - x + p3)
                    found = True
                    break
                else:
                    x += 1
                    y -= 1
            if not found:
                print(-1)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the default case in the loop, which should print `-1` instead of `p3` when no valid distribution is found. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
