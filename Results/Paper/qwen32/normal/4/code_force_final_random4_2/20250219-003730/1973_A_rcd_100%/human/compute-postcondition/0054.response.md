The code snippet `y -= 1` decrements the value of `y` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `x`) are not affected by this operation. The initial conditions about `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and the sum being odd remain valid. The only change is in the value of `y`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `p3` must be at least 1; `x` is increased by 1; `y` is decreased by 1.**
