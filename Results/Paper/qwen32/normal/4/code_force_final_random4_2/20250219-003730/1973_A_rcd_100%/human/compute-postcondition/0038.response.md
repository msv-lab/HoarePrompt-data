Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 1, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. Since the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is always odd according to the precondition, the condition `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0` is always true, and the if part is always executed.**
