Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`; `x` is 1; `y` is `p3 - 1`; `p1 - x` is greater than `p2 - y`**

Natural Language: The value of `y` has been decremented by 1. All other conditions and values remain the same, except `y` is now `p3 - 1`.
