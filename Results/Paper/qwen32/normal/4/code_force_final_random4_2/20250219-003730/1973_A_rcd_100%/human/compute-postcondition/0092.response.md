To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and the conditions under which it breaks or completes all iterations.

The loop runs while `y >= x`. The values of `x` and `y` change in each iteration based on the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y`. If this condition is met, the loop prints `p1 - x + p3` and breaks. If the condition is not met, `x` is incremented by 1 and `y` is decremented by 1. The loop continues until `y < x`.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
- After the first iteration: `x` is 1 and `y` is `p3 - 1` if `p1 - x > p2 - y`.
- After the second iteration: `x` is 2 and `y` is `p3 - 2` if `p1 - x > p2 - y`.
- After the third iteration: `x` is 3 and `y` is `p3 - 3` if `p1 - x > p2 - y`.

The loop will continue until `x` exceeds `y`. If the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is never met, the loop will print `p3` after `y` becomes less than `x`.

To determine the final state, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is never met until `y < x`. In this scenario, the loop will run until `x` is `p3 + 1` and `y` is `0`. Since `y` becomes less than `x`, the loop will print `p3` and terminate.

Therefore, the output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **p3**

In natural language, this means that if the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is never satisfied during the iterations, the loop will complete all its iterations and print the value of `p3`.
