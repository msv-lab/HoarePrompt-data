Postcondition: **`t` is the new string provided by the user input, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `s` is the new string provided by the user input, `f` is a string of length `n` where each character is either '0' or '1', `s1` is the count of '1's in the string `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in the string `t`, and `cnt` is the total number of positions where `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. If `s1` is equal to `t1`, then no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.**
