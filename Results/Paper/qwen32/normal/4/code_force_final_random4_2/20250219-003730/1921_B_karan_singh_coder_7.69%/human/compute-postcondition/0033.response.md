Output State: **`t` is the new string provided by the user input, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is the new string provided by the user input, `f` is a string of length `n` where each character is either '0' or '1', `s1` is the count of '1's in the new string `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in the string `t`, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, `cnt` will hold the total number of positions where the characters in strings `s` and `t` differ. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial descriptions.
