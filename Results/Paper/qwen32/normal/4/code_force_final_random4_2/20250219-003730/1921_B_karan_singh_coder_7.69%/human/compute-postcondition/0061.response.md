Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two strings `s` and `f`, each of length `n` where `n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, and each character in the strings is either '0' or '1'. The function returns a result for each test case based on the comparison of strings `s` and `f`.**
