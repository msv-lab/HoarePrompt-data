The code snippet `n = len(array)` calculates the length of the list `array` and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since `array` is a permutation of length `n`, the length of `array` is `n` by definition. Therefore, after executing the code, `n` will hold the length of the permutation, which is the same as the initial `n` provided in the precondition.

Output State: **array is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and find is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n) that needs to be found in the permutation; n is the length of the array.**
