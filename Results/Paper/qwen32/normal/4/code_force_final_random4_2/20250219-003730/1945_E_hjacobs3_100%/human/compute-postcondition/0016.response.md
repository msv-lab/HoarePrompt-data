Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`; `find` is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n); `r` must be at least `l + 3`; `mid` is the integer value `(l + r) // 2`; `l` is now equal to `mid`.**

In natural language: The value of `l` has been updated to be equal to `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged.
