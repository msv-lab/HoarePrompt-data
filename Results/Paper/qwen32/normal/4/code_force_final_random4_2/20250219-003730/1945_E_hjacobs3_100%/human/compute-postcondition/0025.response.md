Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `array`, which is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, and a parameter `find`, which is an integer. The function returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the 1-based index of the largest element in `array` that is less than or equal to `find`, and the second string is the 1-based index of `find` in `array`.**
