The value of `l` is updated to be equal to `mid`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`; `find` is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n); `l` is `mid`; `r` is `n`; `mid` is `(0 + n) // 2`; `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`.
