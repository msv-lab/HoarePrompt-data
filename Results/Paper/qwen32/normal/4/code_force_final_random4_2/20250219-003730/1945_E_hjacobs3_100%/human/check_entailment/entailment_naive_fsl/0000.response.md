Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search loop continues while `r - l > 1`, but the initial values of `l` and `r` are `0` and `n` respectively. This means the loop will not execute correctly for the first test case where the array is already sorted and `x` is present in the array. The loop should run while `r > l`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Swaps**:
   - The program attempts to swap elements to make `array[l]` equal to `x` after the binary search. However, the logic for swapping is incorrect. The program only prints one swap if `l` is not the index of `x`, but it doesn't actually perform the swap in the array, and it doesn't handle the case where two swaps are needed.
   - The program does not ensure that after the swaps, the binary search will correctly identify `x`.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The output format is incorrect. The program should print the number of swaps followed by the swaps themselves, but it does not correctly handle multiple swaps or the case where no swaps are needed.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
5 3
3 5 4 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```

**Actual Output:**
```
0
```

This test case works by chance because the array is already sorted and `x` is at the correct position after the binary search. However, let's consider another test case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5 3
1 5 4 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
4 5
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
4 5
```

The output format is correct for this case, but the program does not guarantee that the binary search will correctly identify `x` after the swap. The program does not handle cases where two swaps are needed, and it does not ensure that the binary search will correctly identify `x` after the swaps.

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5 3
1 5 4 2 6
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
4 5
5 3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
4 5
```

In this case, the program only performs one swap and does not correctly identify `x` after the binary search. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
