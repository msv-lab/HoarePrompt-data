Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`; `find` is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n); `r` must be at least `l + 3`; `mid` is the integer value `(l + r) // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `mid` is recalculated as `(l + r) // 2`, but the values of `array`, `find`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. The condition that `r` must be at least `l + 3` is still valid, and the relationship between `mid`, `l`, and `r` is updated based on the new calculation of `mid`.
