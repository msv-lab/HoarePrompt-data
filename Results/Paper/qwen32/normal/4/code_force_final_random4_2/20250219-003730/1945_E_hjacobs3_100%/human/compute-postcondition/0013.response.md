Postcondition: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`; `find` is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n); `r` must be at least `l + 2`; `mid` is the integer value `(l + r) // 2`. If `array[mid] <= find`, then `l` is updated to the value of `mid`. Otherwise, `r` is updated to the value of `mid`.**
