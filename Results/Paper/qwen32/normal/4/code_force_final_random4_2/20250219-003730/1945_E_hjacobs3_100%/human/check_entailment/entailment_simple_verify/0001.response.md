### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the problem and the provided program using the annotations and the problem description.

#### Problem Analysis

The goal is to rearrange the elements in a permutation such that after performing a binary search, the element at position `l` is equal to `x`. The binary search is described in the problem statement, and we can perform up to 2 swaps to achieve our goal.

#### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`, and then the permutation `array`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It initializes `l` and `r` for binary search.
   - It performs the binary search on the original array without any modifications. This is incorrect because the problem requires us to rearrange the array using up to 2 swaps so that the binary search ends with `p_l` equal to `x`.
   - After the binary search, it checks if the element at position `l` is equal to `x`.
   - If they are not equal, it prints `1` and suggests a swap between `l` and the index of `x` in the array. This is incorrect because the binary search was performed on the original array, and the suggested swap may not work correctly.
   - If they are equal, it prints `0`.

#### Issues in the Program

1. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search is performed on the original array without any modifications. However, the problem requires us to rearrange the array using up to 2 swaps so that the binary search ends with `p_l` equal to `x`.

2. **Swap Logic**: The program suggests a single swap if the binary search does not end with `p_l` equal to `x`. However, the problem guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient, and the program does not utilize this fact.

3. **Output Format**: The program prints the number of swaps and the swap operations directly from within the `func_1` function. This is not the expected behavior since the output should be collected and printed for each test case after processing all test cases.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where multiple swaps are needed and does not ensure that the binary search will end with `p_l` equal to `x` after the swaps.

#### Annotations

The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- Before the function call: `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, and `find` is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n) that needs to be found in the permutation.
- Inside `func_1`: The binary search is performed on the original array without any modifications, and the state of `l` and `r` is described.
- After the binary search: The program checks if `l` is equal to the index of `find` in the array and suggests a swap if they are not equal.

#### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to rearrange the array using up to 2 swaps so that the binary search ends with `p_l` equal to `x`. The binary search is performed on the original array, and the suggested swap may not work correctly. The program also does not handle cases where multiple swaps are needed.
