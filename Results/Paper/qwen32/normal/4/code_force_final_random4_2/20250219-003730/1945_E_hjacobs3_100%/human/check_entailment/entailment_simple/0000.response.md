### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by performing at most two swaps on the permutation to ensure that the binary search algorithm will end up with `p_l` equal to `x`. However, there are a few issues in the logic of the program that make it incorrect:

1. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic in the `func_1` function is correct in terms of the algorithm itself. However, the key requirement is to ensure that after the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`. The current implementation does not guarantee this.

2. **Swapping Logic**: The program checks if `l` is not equal to the index of `x` in the array. If they are not equal, it performs a single swap between `l` and the index of `x`. However, this single swap might not always be sufficient to ensure that after the binary search, `p_l` will be equal to `x`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where `x` is not in its correct position after the binary search even after two swaps. The problem statement guarantees that it is always possible with at most two swaps, but the provided logic does not ensure this.

4. **Output Format**: The program prints the number of swaps and the indices to swap, but the logic does not guarantee that the output will always be correct.

### Example of Incorrectness:

Consider the input:
```
1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```
The output produced by the program:
```
1
1 2
```
After the swap, the array becomes `[3, 4, 1, 5, 2, 6]`. Running the binary search on this array will not result in `p_l` being equal to `3`.

### Correctness:

Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not always produce the correct output. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
