Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`.
- `find` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{find} \leq n\).
- `l` is the index of the largest element in `array` that is less than or equal to `find`.
- `r` is `l + 1`.
- `l` is also equal to the index of the element `find` in `array`.

### Key Points:
- The variable `l` is defined twice in the problem statement, which seems contradictory. However, based on the context, it's reasonable to infer that `l` is primarily defined as the index of the element `find` in `array`.
- The print statement is `print(0)`.

### Analysis:
- The print statement `print(0)` simply prints the integer `0`. It does not depend on the values of `array`, `find`, `l`, or `r`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
