Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`; `find` is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n); `l` is 0; `r` is `n`.
Code of the loop:
while r - l > 1:
    mid = (l + r) // 2
    if array[mid] <= find:
        l = mid
    else:
        r = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`; `find` is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n); if `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, then `l` is updated to `mid` and `r` remains `n`; otherwise, `l` remains 0 and `r` is updated to `mid`. `mid` is recalculated as `(l + r) // 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`; `find` is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n); `r` must be at least `l + 2`; `mid` is the integer value `(l + r) // 2`. If `array[mid] <= find`, then `l` is updated to the value of `mid`. Otherwise, `r` is updated to the value of `mid`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`; `find` is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n); `r` must be at least `l + 3`; `mid` is the integer value `(l + r) // 2`. If `array[mid] <= find`, then `l` is now equal to `mid`. Otherwise, `r` is updated to `(l + r) // 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
