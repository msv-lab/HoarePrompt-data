The value of `l` is updated to the value of `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`; `find` is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n); `r` must be at least `l + 2`; `mid` is the integer value `(l + r) // 2`; `l` is the integer value `mid`.**
