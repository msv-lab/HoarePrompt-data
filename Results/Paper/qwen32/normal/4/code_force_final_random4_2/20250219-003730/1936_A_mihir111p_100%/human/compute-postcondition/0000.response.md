The print statement in the given code snippet outputs a question mark followed by the values of the integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. According to the initial state, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers that satisfy the condition \(0 \leq a, b, c, d < n\), where `n` is the length of a secret permutation `p`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not specified, we can only describe them in terms of the given constraints. Therefore, the output will be a question mark followed by these four integers, each of which is between 0 and \(n-1\) inclusive.

Output: **? [a] [b] [c] [d] (where a, b, c, and d are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n)**
