To determine the final output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand the conditions under which the loop continues to run. The loop runs while `i <= m` and `i * i <= n + i`. Let's analyze these conditions and how they affect the loop's execution.

**Initial State:**
- `n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()`
- `i` is 1
- `ans` is 0

**Loop Conditions:**
1. `i <= m`
2. `i * i <= n + i`

**Loop Body:**
- `ans += (n + i) // (i * i)`
- `i += 1`

**Output States Given:**
- After 1 iteration: `i` is 2, `ans` is `n + 1`
- After 2 iterations: `i` is 3, `ans` is `n + 1 + (n + 2) // 4`
- After 3 iterations: `i` is 4, `ans` is `n + 1 + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9`

From the given output states, we can infer that the loop adds the value `(n + i) // (i * i)` to `ans` in each iteration and increments `i` by 1.

The loop will terminate when either `i > m` or `i * i > n + i`. To find the final state, we need to determine the exact point at which the loop stops.

Let's denote the final value of `i` as `i_final`. The loop will stop when `i_final > m` or `i_final * i_final > n + i_final`.

**Final Output State:**
- `i` will be `i_final + 1` (since `i` is incremented at the end of each iteration)
- `ans` will be the sum of `(n + j) // (j * j)` for all `j` from 1 to `i_final`

Given the pattern of the output states, the final output state can be expressed as:

Output State: **`i` is `i_final + 1` and `ans` is the sum of `(n + j) // (j * j)` for all `j` from 1 to `i_final`.**

To put this in a more understandable form, the loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions are satisfied, and it will stop when either `i` exceeds `m` or `i * i` exceeds `n + i`. The final value of `ans` will be the cumulative sum of `(n + j) // (j * j)` for all valid `j` values.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `i_final + 1` and `ans` is `n + 1 + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9 + ... + (n + i_final) // (i_final * i_final)`.**
