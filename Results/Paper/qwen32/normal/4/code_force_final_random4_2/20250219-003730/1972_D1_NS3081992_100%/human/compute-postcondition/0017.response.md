Output State: **`d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `d[da]` is a list with at least 3 elements, `processing` is a list of integers where `processing[di - 1]` is 1, `da` is an integer, `rank` is a list of integers, and `di` is the third element of `d[da]`. `tmp` is the minimum of its previous value and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`.**

Explanation: The value of `tmp` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the result of the function `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
