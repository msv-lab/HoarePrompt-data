To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the functions `func_10()` and `func_15()` and how they interact with the loop.

From the given information, we can infer the following:
- `func_10()` determines the number of iterations the loop will execute.
- `func_15()` returns a value that is printed to the standard output in each iteration.

The output states after 1, 2, and 3 iterations indicate that `func_10()` must return a positive integer, and `func_15()` is called and prints a value in each iteration.

Given that the loop will execute `func_10()` times, the final output state will be determined by the number of times the loop runs and the values printed by `func_15()`.

**Output State: **The loop has executed `func_10()` times, and `func_15()` has been called and printed a value to the standard output in each of these iterations. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.**

In simpler terms, the loop will print a value returned by `func_15()` for each of the `func_10()` iterations, and the initial constraints on `n` and `m` will still hold.
