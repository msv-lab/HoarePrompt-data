The code snippet provided writes to the standard output the string representation of the value returned by `func_15()`, followed by a newline character. This operation does not affect the variables `n` and `m` directly. The function `func_15()` has already been called and its return value has been printed, but the return value of `func_10()` is irrelevant to this specific code snippet as it is not used or modified here.

Therefore, the state of `n` and `m` remains unchanged. The output state includes the fact that a value has been printed to the standard output.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, a positive integer value returned by `func_15()` has been printed to the standard output.**
