To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head conditions:

The loop condition is:
```
while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
```

This means that for the loop to execute again, both conditions must be true:
1. `i <= m`
2. `i * i <= n + i`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be at least 2
- `m` must be at least 2
- `i` is 3
- `ans` is `n + 1 + (n + 2) // 4` (though `ans` is not directly involved in the loop condition, we should ensure the other conditions are met).

Let's analyze the conditions:

1. `i <= m`: Since `i` is 3, `m` must be at least 3 to satisfy this condition.
2. `i * i <= n + i`: Substituting `i = 3`, we get `3 * 3 <= n + 3`, which simplifies to `9 <= n + 3`, and further to `6 <= n`. Since `n` must already be at least 2, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 6.

So, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `m` to be at least 3 and `n` to be at least 6.

State: **`n` must be at least 6, `m` must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `ans` is `n + 1 + (n + 2) // 4`**
