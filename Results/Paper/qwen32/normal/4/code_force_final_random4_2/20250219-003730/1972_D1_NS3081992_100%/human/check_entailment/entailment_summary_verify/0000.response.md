To determine the correctness of the program based on the provided problem description, program code, and function summaries, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the code, especially focusing on `func_15` and `func_16`.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis:
1. **Utility Functions**:
   - Functions `func_1` to `func_10` are utility functions for reading input.
   - Functions `func_12` to `func_14` are not directly related to the problem at hand.
   - `func_13` computes the greatest common divisor (gcd) using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - `func_15` seems to be the core function that calculates the number of valid pairs for a given \(n\) and \(m\).
   - `func_16` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15` for each test case, printing the result.

### Examination of `func_15`:
The function `func_15` contains the following logic:
```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```
This function iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(\min(m, \sqrt{n + i})\). For each \(i\), it increments the answer by \(\frac{n + i}{i^2}\) and then subtracts 1 from the final result.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements:
The given logic does not directly match the problem requirements. The problem requires checking each pair \((a, b)\) to see if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The function `func_15` does not explicitly iterate over all pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition.

### Correct Logic:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to iterate over all pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a possible correct implementation:

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        n, m = func_7()
        sys.stdout.write(str(count_valid_pairs(n, m)) + '\n')
```

### Conclusion:
The provided function `func_15` does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. It uses a different approach that does not match the problem requirements. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

**Final: False**
