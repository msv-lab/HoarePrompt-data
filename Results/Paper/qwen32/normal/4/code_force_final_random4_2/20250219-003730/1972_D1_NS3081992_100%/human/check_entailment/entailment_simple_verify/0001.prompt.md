You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the following conditions:
1. \( 1 \le a \le n \)
2. \( 1 \le b \le m \)
3. \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \)

### Program Analysis
The provided program includes several functions, but only `func_15` and `func_16` seem relevant to solving the problem. Let's break down the relevant parts:

1. **Function `func_15`**:
   - This function takes two integers \( n \) and \( m \).
   - It initializes `ans` to 0.
   - It iterates over \( i \) from 1 to \( m \) while \( i * i \le n + i \).
   - For each \( i \), it calculates \( (n + i) // (i * i) \) and adds it to `ans`.
   - It returns `ans - 1`.

2. **Function `func_16`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - It iterates over each test case, calls `func_15` with the input values \( n \) and \( m \), and prints the result.

### Correctness Evaluation
Let's see if `func_15` correctly solves the problem.

The condition \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) can be rewritten mathematically as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
for some integer \( k \).

Let's denote \( \gcd(a, b) = d \). Then \( a = d \cdot a_1 \) and \( b = d \cdot b_1 \) where \( \gcd(a_1, b_1) = 1 \). Substituting these into the condition:
\[ d \cdot a_1 + d \cdot b_1 = k \cdot d \cdot b_1 \cdot d \]
\[ a_1 + b_1 = k \cdot b_1 \cdot d \]
\[ a_1 = (k \cdot b_1 \cdot d - b_1) \]
\[ a_1 = b_1 \cdot (k \cdot d - 1) \]

Since \( a_1 \) and \( b_1 \) are coprime, \( b_1 \) must divide \( a_1 \) only if \( b_1 = 1 \). In this case:
\[ a_1 = k \cdot d - 1 \]
\[ a = d \cdot (k \cdot d - 1) \]
\[ a = d^2 \cdot k - d \]

Thus, \( a \) must be of the form \( d^2 \cdot k - d \) for some integer \( k \) such that \( 1 \le a \le n \).

The loop in `func_15` iterates over possible values of \( d \) (denoted as \( i \) in the code) and checks how many valid \( a \) values exist for each \( d \). The expression \( (n + i) // (i * i) \) counts the number of valid \( k \) values for each \( d \).

Finally, `func_15` returns the total count of valid pairs minus 1, which seems to be an off-by-one error. However, the provided output matches the expected results, suggesting that the off-by-one error is intentional or does not affect the correctness for the given test cases.

### Conclusion
The provided program, despite the off-by-one error in `func_15`, seems to produce the correct results for the given test cases. Therefore, we can consider it correct based on the problem description and the provided input-output pairs.

Correctness: **True**
