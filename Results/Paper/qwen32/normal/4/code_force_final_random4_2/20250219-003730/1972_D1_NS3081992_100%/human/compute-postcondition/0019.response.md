Postcondition: **`d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `d[da]` is a list with at least 3 elements, `processing` is a list of integers, `da` is an integer, `rank` is a list of integers, and `di` is the third element of `d[da]`. If `processing[di - 1]` was 0, then `tmp` is the minimum of `1000000000` and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`, and `processing[di - 1]` remains 0. If `processing[di - 1]` was not 0, then `tmp` remains `1000000000`.**
