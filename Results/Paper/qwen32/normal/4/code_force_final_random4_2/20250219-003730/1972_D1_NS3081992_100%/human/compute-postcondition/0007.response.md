It appears there is a slight discrepancy between the function name provided in the task (`func_16`) and the description of the parameters (`n` and `m`). Given the parameter constraints, I will assume the function should accept `n` and `m` as parameters. Here is the functionality description:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6. The function returns the result of some computation based on these two integers.** 

Since the specific computation or return value based on `n` and `m` is not provided, the functionality is described in terms of the input parameters and the general expectation of a return value based on these inputs.
