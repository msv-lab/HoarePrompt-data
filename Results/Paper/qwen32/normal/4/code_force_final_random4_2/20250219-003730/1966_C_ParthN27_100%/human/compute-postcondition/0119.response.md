Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the length of `s`, `arr` is the newly read list of integers, `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, `ans` is either 1 or remains unchanged if it was 0, and the number of iterations left is `t-1`. If `n` is 2, `s` specifically contains exactly two elements. If `n` is greater than 2, `s` contains more than two elements and `ans` retains its value.**
