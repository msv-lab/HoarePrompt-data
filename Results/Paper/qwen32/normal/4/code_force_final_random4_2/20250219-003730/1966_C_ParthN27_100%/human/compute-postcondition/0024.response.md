Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the length of the list `s` where `n` > 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is a sorted list with `0` as the first element, followed by all unique elements from `arr`. If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 0, indicating that the difference between any two consecutive elements in `s` is 1 or less.**
