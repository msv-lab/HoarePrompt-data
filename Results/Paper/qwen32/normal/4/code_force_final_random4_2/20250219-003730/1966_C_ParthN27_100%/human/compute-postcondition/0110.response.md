Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is the newly read list of integers, `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, the number of iterations left is `t-1`, `i` is `i_end + 2` where `i_end + 2` must be less than `n-1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The value of `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `s` remains unchanged. The number of iterations left is still `t-1`, and `i` remains `i_end + 2`. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement without changing any other variables.
