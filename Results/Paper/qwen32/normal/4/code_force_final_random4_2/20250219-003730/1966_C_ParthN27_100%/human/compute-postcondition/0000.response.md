In the given task, the loop head contains the variable `_` and the function `range(int(input()))`. The loop will execute based on the integer value provided by `int(input())`, which represents the number of test cases `t`. The state of `t` needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute.

Since the loop head only involves `range(int(input()))`, the only variable we can adjust is `t` (the number of test cases). The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The values of `n` and the list of stones `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.
