Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is the newly read list of integers, `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, `ans` is 1, the number of iterations left is `t-1`, and the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is 1 or less**
