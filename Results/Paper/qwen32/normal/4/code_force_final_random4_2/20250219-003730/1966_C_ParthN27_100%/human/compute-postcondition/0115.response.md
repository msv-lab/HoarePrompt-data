The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'Alice'. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, `ans`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely dependent on the string provided within it.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('Alice')`.
2. The string 'Alice' is explicitly provided within the `print` statement.
3. None of the variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, `ans`) are referenced in the `print` statement, so their values do not affect the output.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string 'Alice'.

Output: **Alice**
