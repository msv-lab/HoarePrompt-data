The code snippet `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `arr` to the set `s`. Given that `s` was initially an empty set, after this operation, `s` will contain the element `arr[i]`.

Since the values of `t`, `n`, and the specific elements of `arr` are not altered by this code snippet, they remain the same. The only change is that the set `s` now contains the element `arr[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is a set containing the element `arr[i]`.**
