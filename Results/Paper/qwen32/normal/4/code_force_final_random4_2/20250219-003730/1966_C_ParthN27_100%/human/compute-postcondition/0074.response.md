Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the length of the sorted list `s` with `0` prepended, `arr` is the list of integers read from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements of `arr` with `0` prepended, and `ans` is 1. Since `ans` is 1, `n-2` is even.**
