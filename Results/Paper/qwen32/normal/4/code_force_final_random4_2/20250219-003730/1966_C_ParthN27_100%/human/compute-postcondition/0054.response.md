The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `ans`. This assignment does not affect the values of the other variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, or the initial condition of `ans` based on the value of `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is the list of integers read from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements of `arr` with `0` prepended, `ans` is 1.**
