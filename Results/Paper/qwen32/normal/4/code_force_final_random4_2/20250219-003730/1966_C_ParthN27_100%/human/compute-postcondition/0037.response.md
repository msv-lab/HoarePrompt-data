Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `ans` is defined based on the value of `n-2`:
   - If `n-2` is odd, `ans` is 0.
   - If `n-2` is even, `ans` is 1.
   - Additionally, it is mentioned that `ans` is false, which means `ans` is 0.
   
2. The print statement is:
   ```python
   print('Bob')
   ```

### Analysis:
- The value of `ans` is determined by the parity (odd or even) of `n-2` and is explicitly stated to be 0 (false). However, the print statement does not use the variable `ans` at all. Instead, it prints the string `'Bob'`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string `'Bob'` regardless of the value of `ans`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Bob**
