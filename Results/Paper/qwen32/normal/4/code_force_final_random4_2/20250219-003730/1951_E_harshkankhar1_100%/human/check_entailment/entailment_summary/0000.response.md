### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and its behavior based on the problem requirements and the execution summaries of the functions.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - Multiple test cases.
   - Each test case is a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, print "YES" if there exists a partition of `s` into substrings where each substring is not a palindrome, otherwise print "NO".
   - If "YES", also print the number of parts `k` and the partitioned substrings.

#### Code Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`:**
  - Checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome.
  - Returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome, otherwise `False`.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - Reads a string `s` from the input.
  - Checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1`.
  - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", the number of parts as 1, and the entire string `s` as the partition.
  - If `s` is a palindrome, it looks for the first character that is different from the first character of `s`.
  - If no such character is found (i.e., all characters are the same), it prints "NO".
  - If a different character is found at index `x`, it checks if the substring from `x+1` to the end is not a palindrome.
  - If the substring is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", the number of parts as 2, and the two partitions: `s[:x+1]` and `s[x+1:]`.
  - If the substring is a palindrome and `x` is either 1 or half the length of `s`, it prints "NO".
  - Otherwise, it prints "YES", the number of parts as 2, and the two partitions: `s[:x+2]` and `s[x+2:]`.

#### Verification Against Test Cases:

1. **Test Case 1: `sinktheyacht`**
   - The string is not a palindrome.
   - The function should print "YES", 1, and `sinktheyacht`.
   - This is correctly handled by the function.

2. **Test Case 2: `lllllllll`**
   - The string is a palindrome.
   - All characters are the same.
   - The function should print "NO".
   - This is correctly handled by the function.

3. **Test Case 3: `uwuowouwu`**
   - The string is a palindrome.
   - The first different character is found at index 1.
   - The substring from index 2 to the end (`wouwu`) is not a palindrome.
   - The function should print "YES", 2, and `uw` and `uowouwu`.
   - This is correctly handled by the function.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly handles the problem requirements and passes all the test cases as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

**Correctness: True**
