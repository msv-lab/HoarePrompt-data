The given Python code snippet only contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides several pieces of information about the variables and conditions, but none of these directly influence the output of the `print` statement itself. The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `s`, `n`, `x`, or the results of the function calls `func_1(s[0:])` and `func_1(s[x + 1:])`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `s` is the input string.
2. The variable `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
3. The variable `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that differs from `s[0]`, and `x` is not equal to -1.
4. The function `func_1(s[0:])` returns `True`.
5. The function `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`.

However, these details do not affect the output of the `print` statement, which simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
