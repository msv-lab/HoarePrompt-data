### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided Python code to determine if it correctly implements the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - This function checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
   - If the string is a palindrome, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
   - This function works correctly as per the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads a string `s` from the input and calculates its length `n`.
   - It then checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`. If it's not a palindrome, it prints "YES", followed by "1", and the string `s` itself.
   - If the entire string is a palindrome, it searches for the first character that differs from the first character of the string (`s[0]`). This is stored in `x`.
   - If no such character is found (`x == -1`), it prints "NO".
   - If a differing character is found, it further checks if the substring starting from this character (`s[x + 1:]`) is not a palindrome. If it's not a palindrome, it prints "YES", "2", and the two substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
   - If the substring `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, it checks if `x` is `1` or `n // 2`. If either condition is true, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES", "2", and the two substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.

### Analysis of Edge Cases:

- **Case 1: Entire string is not a palindrome**:
  - The function correctly prints "YES", "1", and the string itself.
  
- **Case 2: Entire string is a palindrome**:
  - The function correctly identifies the first differing character and checks the substring starting from this character.
  - If the substring is not a palindrome, it correctly prints "YES", "2", and the two substrings.
  - If the substring is a palindrome, it correctly handles the cases where `x` is `1` or `n // 2` by printing "NO".
  - Otherwise, it correctly prints "YES", "2", and the two substrings.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly handles the problem requirements and edge cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
