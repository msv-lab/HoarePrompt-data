Postcondition: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of the input string and is greater than or equal to 2. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the first character of `s`, then `x` is set to `i` and the loop or if statement is broken. In both cases, `i` is incremented by 1. `func_1(s[0:])` returns `True`.**
