### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine if a given string can be partitioned into substrings such that none of the substrings are palindromes. Let's break down the logic of the program and verify its correctness based on the provided comments and the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - This function checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
   - If the string is a palindrome, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - Reads a string `s` from the input.
   - Checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`.
   - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints `YES`, followed by `1` (indicating one partition), and the string `s` itself.
   - If `s` is a palindrome, it proceeds to find the first character that differs from the first character of `s` (i.e., `s[0]`).
   - If no such character is found (`x == -1`), it prints `NO` because the string consists of the same character repeated.
   - If a differing character is found, it checks if the substring starting from the differing character (`s[x + 1:]`) is not a palindrome.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints `YES`, `2`, and the two substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, it further checks if `x` is either `1` or `n // 2` (half the length of the string).
       - If `x` is `1` or `n // 2`, it prints `NO` because it cannot partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.
       - Otherwise, it prints `YES`, `2`, and the two substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.

### Verification with Examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `sinktheyacht`
   - The entire string is not a palindrome, so the program correctly prints `YES`, `1`, and `sinktheyacht`.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `lllllllll`
   - The entire string is a palindrome, and all substrings are palindromes, so the program correctly prints `NO`.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `uwuowouwu`
   - The entire string is a palindrome. The first differing character from `s[0]` is at index `1` (`s[1] == 'w'`), and the substring `s[2:]` is not a palindrome. Therefore, the program correctly prints `YES`, `2`, and `uw uowouwu`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles the given problem constraints and examples. It effectively checks if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and prints the appropriate output.

**Correctness: True**
