The given initial state describes several variables and conditions, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `s`, `n`, `x`, or the result of `func_1(s[0:])`. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes the input string `s`, its length `n`, a variable `x` initialized to -1, and the result of a function call `func_1(s[0:])` which is False.
2. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`, regardless of the values of the variables described in the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
