Postcondition: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of the input string, `x` is the index of the first character that differs from `s[0]` or -1 if no such character exists, and `func_1(s[0:])` returns `True`. The current value of `x` is -1, indicating that no character in the string `s` differs from `s[0]`.**
