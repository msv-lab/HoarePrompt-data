Output State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of the input string and is greater than or equal to 2, `x` is `i`, and `func_1(s[0:])` returns `True`. The character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the first character of `s`.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to the value of `i`, while all other variables retain their initial states and preconditions.
