Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to partition a string into substrings such that none of the substrings is a palindrome. If such a partition exists, we should output "YES", the number of parts, and the parts themselves. If no such partition exists, we should output "NO".

### Program Analysis

#### Function 1: `func_1(s) -> bool`
- This function checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
- It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome, `False` otherwise.

#### Function 2: `func_2()`
- This function reads a string `s` from the input.
- It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome. If it's not, it prints "YES", the number of parts (1), and the string itself as the only part.
- If the entire string is a palindrome, it searches for the first character that is different from the first character.
- If no such character is found (i.e., the string consists of the same character repeated), it prints "NO".
- If a different character is found at position `x`, it then checks if the substring from `x+1` to the end is not a palindrome. If it's not, it prints "YES", the number of parts (2), and the string split at `x+1`.
- If the substring from `x+1` to the end is a palindrome, it further checks if `x` is 1 or `x` is half the length of the string. If either condition is true, it prints "NO".
- Otherwise, it prints "YES", the number of parts (2), and the string split at `x+2`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, consider the string "aaaaa". The program will find the first different character at position 1, but the substring from position 2 to the end is still "aaa", which is a palindrome. The program should be able to split the string into more parts if necessary.

2. **General Case Handling:**
   - The program assumes that if a different character is found, the string can always be split into two parts such that neither part is a palindrome. This is not always true. For example, the string "abacaba" has no valid partition where none of the parts is a palindrome.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program outputs the parts with an extra space between them (e.g., "uw uow ouwu" instead of "uw uow ouwu" without spaces in between).

### Correctness

Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly handle all cases and does not guarantee a valid partition when one exists. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
