Let's break down the given information and determine what will be printed based on the precondition.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`s`**: The input string.
2. **`n`**: The length of the input string `s`.
3. **`x`**: The index of the first character in `s` that differs from `s[0]`. It is specified that `x` is not equal to -1, meaning there is at least one character in `s` that is different from the first character.
4. **`func_1(s[0:])`**: Returns `True`.
5. **`func_1(s[x + 1:])`**: Also returns `True`.
6. **`x`**: The value of `x` is either `1` or `n // 2`.

### Code to Analyze:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `s`, `n`, `x`, or any other variables. The statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

### Conclusion:
Since the `print` statement is hardcoded to print `'NO'`, the output will be `'NO'` regardless of the values of the variables `s`, `n`, and `x`.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
