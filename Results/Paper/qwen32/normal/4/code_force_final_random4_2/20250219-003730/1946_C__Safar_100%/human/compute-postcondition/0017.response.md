The code snippet `stack.append((node, x))` appends a tuple `(node, x)` to the `stack` list. Given the initial state, `node` is the next element in `g[1]` after the first one, and `x` is 1.

Since `stack` can either be `[(1, 1)]` or `[(1, 1), (node, x)]` before the execution of the code, after the execution, `stack` will definitely have the tuple `(node, x)` appended to it.

The values of `A`, `g`, `k`, `visited`, `d`, `r`, `x`, and `p` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree where `g[1]` must have at least two elements, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed, `stack` is `[(1, 1), (node, 1)]` or `[(1, 1), (node1, 1), (node, 1)]` depending on the initial state of `stack`, `visited` is `{1}`, `d` is `{1: 1}`, `r` is 0, `x` is 1, `p` is 1, and `x` is in `visited`.**
