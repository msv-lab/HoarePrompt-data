Output State: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed, `stack` is `[]`, `visited` is an empty set, `r` is either 0 or 1, `x` is 1, `p` is 1, and `x` is not in the `visited` set. If `d[x]` is greater than or equal to `A`, then `r` is 1. Otherwise, `d[x]` is 2 and `r` is 0.**

The variable `visited` has been updated to remove the element `x`, making it an empty set. All other variables retain their initial values.
