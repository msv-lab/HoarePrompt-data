The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, the number of vertices in a tree; `k`, the number of edges to be removed such that \(1 \leq k < n\); and `edges`, a list of tuples representing the edges between vertices. The function performs a binary search to determine a value `r` and prints it. The purpose of the function is to compute and print a value related to the structure of the tree after hypothetical edge removals, but it does not return the modified tree structure.
