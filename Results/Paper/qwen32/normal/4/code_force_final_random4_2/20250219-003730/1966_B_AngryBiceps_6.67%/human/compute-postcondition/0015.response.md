The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the third element in the list `a` to the `first_row` variable. 

Given the initial state:
- `first_row` is the first character of the initial input string concatenated with the first character of the new input string.
- `a[-1]` refers to the third element of the list `a`, which is the value of `input()`.
- `a[-1][0]` is the first character of the value of `input()`.

After executing the code, `first_row` will have its original value concatenated with the first character of the value of `input()`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than `i`, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list containing three elements where the first element is the initial input string, the second element is the new input string, and the third element is the value of `input()`, `first_row` is the first character of the initial input string concatenated with the first character of the new input string and the first character of the value of `input()`, `last_row` is the last character of the initial input string concatenated with the last character of the new input string, `i` is 4**.
