Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an input string, `first_row` is a string containing the first character of each input string concatenated together, `last_row` is a string containing the last character of each input string concatenated together, `i` is `n`. Either the length of the set of characters in `a[0]` is not equal to 1, or `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`. If the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is 1 and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`, the program follows the if part; otherwise, it follows the else part.**
