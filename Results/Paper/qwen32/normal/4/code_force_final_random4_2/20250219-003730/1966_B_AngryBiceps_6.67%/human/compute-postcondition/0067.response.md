The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing two elements (the original input and the newly appended input), `first_row` is the concatenation of the original `first_row` and the first character of the last element in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the last element in `a` repeated twice, `i` is 2**
