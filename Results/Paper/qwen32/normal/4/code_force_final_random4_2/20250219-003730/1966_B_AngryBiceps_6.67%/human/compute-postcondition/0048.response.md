Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is the result of `input()`), `first_row` is the first character of each element in `a` concatenated together, `last_row` is the last character of each element in `a` concatenated together, `i` is 0, the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is 1, and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`.**
