The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the third element of the list `a` to `last_row`. 

Given that `a[-1][-1]` refers to the last character of the third element of the list `a`, which is `a[2][-1]`, this value is appended to `last_row`. 

Therefore, `last_row` will now be the concatenation of its previous value and the last character of the third element of `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than `i`, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list containing three elements where the first element is the initial input string, the second element is the new input string, and the third element is the value of `input()`, `first_row` is the first character of the initial input string concatenated with the first character of the new input string and the first character of the value of `input()`, `last_row` is the last character of the initial input string concatenated with the last character of the new input string and the last character of the value of `input()`, `i` is 4.**
