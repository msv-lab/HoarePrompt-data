Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an input string, `first_row` is a string containing the first character of each input string concatenated together, `last_row` is a string containing the last character of each input string concatenated together, and `i` is `n`. If the first string in `a` has all identical characters and it is not equal to the last string in `a`, then the program follows the if part; otherwise, it follows the else part. In the else part, either the length of the set of characters in `a[0]` is not equal to 1, or `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`. Additionally, if the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is 1 and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`, the program would have followed the if part, but since it did not, either `first_row` has more than one unique character or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.**
