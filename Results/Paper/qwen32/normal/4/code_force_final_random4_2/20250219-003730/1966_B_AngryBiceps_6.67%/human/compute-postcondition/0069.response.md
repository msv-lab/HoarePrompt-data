The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last element in the list `a` to `first_row`. Given the initial state, `a` is a list containing three elements, and `first_row` is the concatenation of the original `first_row` and the first character of the newly appended input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing three elements (the original input, the newly appended input, and the new input), `first_row` is the concatenation of the original `first_row`, the first character of the newly appended input, and the first character of the new input, `last_row` is the last character of the new input repeated twice, `i` is 2.**

In simpler terms, `first_row` now includes the first character of the most recent input added to the list `a`.
