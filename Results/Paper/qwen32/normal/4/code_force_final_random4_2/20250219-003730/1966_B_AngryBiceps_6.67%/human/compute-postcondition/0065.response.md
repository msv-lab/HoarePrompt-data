The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last element in the list `a` to `first_row`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `m` is the second integer from the input
- `a` is a list containing two elements (the original input and the newly appended input)
- `first_row` is the first character of the first element in `a`
- `last_row` is the last character of the last element in `a`
- `i` is 1

After executing the code snippet, `first_row` is updated to include the first character of the last element in `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing two elements (the original input and the newly appended input), `first_row` is the concatenation of the original `first_row` and the first character of the last element in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the last element in `a`, `i` is 1.**
