Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is an input value), `first_row` is the concatenation of the first characters of all elements in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the last element in `a` repeated `n` times, `i` is `n-1`. The first element of `a` consists of identical characters and is not equal to the last element of `a`.**
