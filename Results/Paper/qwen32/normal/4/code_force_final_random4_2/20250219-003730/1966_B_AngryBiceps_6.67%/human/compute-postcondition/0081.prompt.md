Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 500. Each of the next n lines contains m characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = []
    first_row = ''
    last_row = ''
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(input())
        first_row += a[-1][0]
        last_row += a[-1][-1]
    if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
        print('NO')
    elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an input string, `first_row` is a string containing the first character of each input string concatenated together, `last_row` is a string containing the last character of each input string concatenated together, and `i` is `n`. If the first string in `a` has all identical characters and it is not equal to the last string in `a`, then the program follows the if part; otherwise, it follows the else part. In the else part, either the length of the set of characters in `a[0]` is not equal to 1, or `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`. Additionally, if the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is 1 and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`, the program would have followed the if part, but since it did not, either `first_row` has more than one unique character or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is the result of `input()`), `first_row` is the first character of each element in `a` concatenated together, `last_row` is the last character of each element in `a` concatenated together, and `i` is 0. If the first element of `a` consists of identical characters and is not equal to the last element of `a`, the condition from the if part is met. Otherwise, either the first element of `a` does not consist of identical characters or it is equal to the last element of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is an input value), `first_row` is the concatenation of the first characters of all elements in `a`, and `last_row` is the last character of the last element in `a` repeated `n` times. `i` is `n-1`. If the first element of `a` consists of identical characters and is not equal to the last element of `a`, then the condition in the if part holds. Otherwise, either the length of the set of characters in `a[0]` is not equal to 1, or `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`. Additionally, if the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is equal to 1 and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`, then the condition in the if part holds. Otherwise, either the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not equal to 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
