Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to `n`, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is an input value), `first_row` is the concatenation of the first characters of all elements in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the last element in `a` repeated `n` times, `i` is `n-1`. Either the length of the set of characters in `a[0]` is not equal to 1, or `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`. Additionally, either the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not equal to 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.**
