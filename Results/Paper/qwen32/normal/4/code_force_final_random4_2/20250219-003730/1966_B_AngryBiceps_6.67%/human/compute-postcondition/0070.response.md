The code snippet appends the last character of the last element in the list `a` to the `last_row` string. Given that `last_row` is initially the last character of the new input repeated twice, after the operation, `last_row` will consist of the last character of the new input repeated three times.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing three elements (the original input, the newly appended input, and the new input), `first_row` is the concatenation of the original `first_row`, the first character of the newly appended input, and the first character of the new input, `last_row` is the last character of the new input repeated three times, `i` is 2.**
