The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last element in the list `a` to the string `first_row`. Since `a` contains only one element, which is the input value, `a[-1]` refers to this single element. Let's denote this single element as `x`. Therefore, `a[-1][0]` is the first character of `x`.

Given that `first_row` was initially an empty string, after the operation, `first_row` will contain this first character.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input value, `first_row` is the first character of the input value in `a`, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is 0**.
