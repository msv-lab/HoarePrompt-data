The provided `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, `last_row`, `i`) mentioned in the initial state. The string `'NO'` is explicitly provided to be printed.

Therefore, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, `last_row`, or `i`, the output of the `print` statement will always be `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
