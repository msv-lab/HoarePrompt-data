The code snippet `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` modifies the value of `ans1` by subtracting twice the value of the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Given the initial state, `i` is calculated as `x + k - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input and greater than 0, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `x` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `x + k - 1`, `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` encountered during the loop, `ans1` is the sum of the list `a` minus twice the value of `a[i]`.**

In simpler terms, after executing the code, `ans1` is reduced by twice the value of the element at index `i` in the list `a`. All other variables retain their initial values.
