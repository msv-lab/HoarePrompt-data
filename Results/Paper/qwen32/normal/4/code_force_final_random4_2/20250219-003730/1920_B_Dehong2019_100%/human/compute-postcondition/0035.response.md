The code snippet assigns the sum of the list `a` to the variable `ans1`. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`, and `ans2` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input and greater than 0, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `x` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `x + k - 1`, `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` encountered during the loop, `ans1` is the sum of the list `a`.**
