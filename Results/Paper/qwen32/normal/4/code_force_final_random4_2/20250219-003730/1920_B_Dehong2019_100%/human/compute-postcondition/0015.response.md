The code snippet `ans1 += a[i]` increments the value of `ans1` by the value of the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Given that `i` is `x-1`, this means `ans1` is incremented by the value of the `x-th` element in the list `a` (considering 0-based indexing).

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[x-1]`, `i` is `x-1`, `ans2` is the sum of the elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`**.
