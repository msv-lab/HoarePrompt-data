The code snippet `ans1 += a[i]` increments the value of `ans1` by the value of `a[i]`. Given that `i` is `x + k - 1`, the value of `a[i]` is the element at the index `x + k - 1` in the list `a`.

Since `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, and `i` is a valid index (because `t` is an integer greater than 0, and `k` is greater than 0), `a[i]` will be a specific integer from the list `a`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged, and `ans2` remains as calculated in the previous iteration. The only change is in the value of `ans1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `x + k - 1`, `ans1` is increased by `a[i]`, `ans2` remains as calculated in the previous iteration.**
