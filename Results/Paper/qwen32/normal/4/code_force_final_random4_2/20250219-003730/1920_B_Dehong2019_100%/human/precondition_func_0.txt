t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each of the following t test cases is described by two lines: the first line contains three integers n, k, and x such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= n, and 1 <= x <= n. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 <= a_i <= 1000. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
