Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input and greater than 0, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `x + k - 1`, `ans2` is `max(ans1, ans2)` where `ans1` is calculated as `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + a[i] - 2 * a[i + x]` if `i + x` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans1` retains its initial value which is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`.**

In simpler terms, `ans2` now holds the maximum value between `ans1` and its previous value. The value of `ans1` is recalculated if `i + x` is less than `n`, otherwise, it remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial values.
