The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. The initial state only mentions that `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. After executing the code, the values of `n`, `k`, and `x` are set to the integers read from the input, and `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from input.**
