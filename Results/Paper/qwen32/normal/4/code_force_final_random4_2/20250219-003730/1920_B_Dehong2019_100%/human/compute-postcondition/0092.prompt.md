Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer read from input, representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
    a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())), reverse=True)
    ans1 = sum(a)
    for i in range(x):
        ans1 -= a[i] * 2
    ans2 = ans1
    for i in range(k):
        ans1 += a[i]
        if i + x < n:
            ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
        ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)
    print(ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer read from input, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `x + k - 1`, `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` encountered during the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer read from input and greater than 0, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `x` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `x + k - 1`, `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + sum(a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[k-1]) - 2 * (a[x] + a[x+1] + ... + a[x+k-1])` if `x + k - 1 < n`, otherwise it retains the sum up to `a[k-1]` without subtracting further elements, `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` encountered during the iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: ans1 = sum(a) - 2 * (sum(a[x+k-1:2x+k-1]) - sum(a[0:k]) + sum(a[x:x+k])), ans2 = max(ans1 across all iterations)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
