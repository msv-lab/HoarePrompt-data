Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input and greater than 0, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `x` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `i` is 1, `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` encountered during the loop, `ans1` is `sum(a) - 6 * a[i]`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans1` has been updated by subtracting `2 * a[i]` from its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
