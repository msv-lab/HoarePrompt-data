To determine what will be printed when the `print(ans2)` statement executes, we need to understand the variables and the operations involved in the initial state.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`ans1` Calculation:**
   - `ans1` is defined as a formula involving the sum of elements in the list `a`.
   - The formula is: 
     \[
     \text{ans1} = \text{sum}(a) - 2 \times \left( \text{sum}(a[x+k-1:2x+k-1]) - \text{sum}(a[0:k]) + \text{sum}(a[x:x+k]) \right)
     \]
   - This formula suggests that `ans1` is calculated based on the total sum of `a` minus twice a specific combination of sub-sums of `a`.

2. **`ans2` Calculation:**
   - `ans2` is defined as the maximum value of `ans1` across all iterations.
   - This means that `ans2` holds the highest value of `ans1` computed during the iterations.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
- The `print(ans2)` statement will output the maximum value of `ans1` computed during the iterations.
- Since the exact values of `a`, `x`, and `k` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans2`.
- However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe `ans2` as the maximum value of `ans1` across all iterations.

### Final Output:
Output: **ans2 (where ans2 is the maximum value of ans1 across all iterations)**
