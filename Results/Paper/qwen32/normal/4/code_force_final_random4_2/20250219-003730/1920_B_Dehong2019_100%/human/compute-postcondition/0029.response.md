Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `x + 1`, `ans2` is `max(ans1, ans2)`**

Explanation: The code updates `ans2` to be the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `ans1` is not directly affected by this line of code, but it is used in the calculation of `ans2`.
