Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[x-1]`, `i` is `x-1`, `ans2` is the sum of the elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`, and `i + x` is less than `n`.**
