The value of `ans1` is incremented by `a[i]`. Given that `i` is `2x + k - 2`, the new value of `ans1` will be the previous `ans1` plus the element of the list `a` at the index `2x + k - 2`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `ans2`, `_`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input and greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the new input, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` is the third integer read from the new input, `a` is a new list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `2x + k - 2`, `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[x + k - 1] + a[x + k] + ... + a[2x + k - 2]) + a[i]`, `ans2` is equal to `sum(a) - 2 * (a[x + k - 1] + a[x + k] + ... + a[2x + k - 2])`, `_` is incremented by `x`**
