Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `x + k - 2`. If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + 2 * a[i] - 4 * a[i + x]`. Otherwise, `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + a[i]`. `ans2` is the maximum of the previous `ans1` and the previous `ans2`.**
