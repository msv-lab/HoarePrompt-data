Output State: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree where each key is a node and its value is a list of its neighbors, `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`**.

In this output state, the `queue` has been initialized with a single tuple containing the `start` node and `0`, which likely represents the initial distance or level from the start node. The values of `start`, `target`, and `tree` remain unchanged from the initial state.
