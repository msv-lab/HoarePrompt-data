Output State: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree where each key is a node and its value is a list of its neighbors, `queue` is a deque (now empty), `visited` is a set containing the single element `start`, `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0.**

Natural Language: The `queue` is now empty after the `popleft` operation, and the variables `current` and `dist` have been assigned the values `start` and `0`, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
