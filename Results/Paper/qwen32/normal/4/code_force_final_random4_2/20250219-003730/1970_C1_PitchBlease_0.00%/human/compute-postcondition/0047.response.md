Postcondition: **`queue` is not empty and may or may not contain an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`. `visited` contains all reachable nodes from `start`, and if `neighbor` was not already in `visited`, it is now included. `current` is the first element of the tuple removed from the queue and is a key in `tree` with `tree[current]` having at least one element. `dist` is the second element of the tuple removed from the queue.**
