Output State: **`queue` contains an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, `visited` contains all reachable nodes from `start`, including `neighbor`, `current` is the first element of the tuple removed from the queue and is a key in `tree` with `tree[current]` having at least two elements, `dist` is the second element of the tuple removed from the queue, `neighbor` is the next unprocessed element in `tree[current]`.**

In natural language: The `queue` now includes a new tuple consisting of `neighbor` and `dist + 1`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions, including `visited`, `current`, `dist`, and `neighbor`.
