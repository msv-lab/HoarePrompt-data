You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, target is an integer representing the target node in the tree, tree is an adjacency list representation of the tree where each key is a node and its value is a list of its neighbors.
def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: The function either returns the distance from `start` to `target` if `target` is found, or it returns nothing (implicitly `None`) if `target` is not reachable from `start`. The `queue` is empty, and `visited` contains all nodes reachable from `start`.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `start` and `target`, which are integers representing the starting node and the target node in a tree, respectively. The tree is represented as an adjacency list where each key is a node and its value is a list of its neighbors. The function performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path distance from the start node to the target node. If the target node is reachable from the start node, the function returns the shortest path distance (`dist`). If the target node is not reachable, the function returns -1.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns dist, which is the shortest path distance from the start node to the target node in the tree.

Case_2: The program returns `dist`, which is the second value of the popped tuple from `queue`.

Case_3: The program returns `dist`, which is the second element of the tuple removed from the queue.

Case_4: The program returns -1


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
