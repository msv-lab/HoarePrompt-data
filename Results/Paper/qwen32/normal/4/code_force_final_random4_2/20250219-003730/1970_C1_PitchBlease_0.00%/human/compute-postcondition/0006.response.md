Postcondition: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree where each key is a node and its value is a list of its neighbors, `queue` is a deque (now empty), `visited` is a set containing the single element `start`, `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0, and `current` is not equal to `target`**
