The code appends a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` to the `queue`. This means that the `queue` now contains the additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` in addition to any elements it previously had. The values of `visited`, `current`, `dist`, and `neighbor` remain unchanged. The `queue` is the only variable that is modified by the code.

Output State: **`queue` is not empty and contains an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, `visited` contains all reachable nodes from `start`, including `neighbor`, `current` is the first element of the tuple removed from the queue and is a key in `tree` with `tree[current]` having at least two elements, `dist` is the second element of the tuple removed from the queue, `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]` that has not yet been processed.**
