Postcondition: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree where `tree[start]` must have at least one neighbor, `queue` is a deque. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `queue` contains an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` and `visited` includes `start`, `neighbor`, and possibly other elements. If `neighbor` is already in `visited`, `queue` and `visited` remain unchanged. `current` is equal to `start` or another node, `dist` is a non-negative integer, and `current` is not equal to `target`. `neighbor` is the next unvisited neighbor of `current`.**
