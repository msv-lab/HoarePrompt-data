Postcondition: **`queue` is not empty, and if `neighbor` was not in `visited`, it is now included and `queue` contains an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`. `visited` contains all reachable nodes from `start`, including `neighbor` if it was not already visited. `current` is the first element of the tuple removed from the queue and is a key in `tree` with `tree[current]` having at least two elements. `dist` is the second element of the tuple removed from the queue, and `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]` that has not yet been processed.**
