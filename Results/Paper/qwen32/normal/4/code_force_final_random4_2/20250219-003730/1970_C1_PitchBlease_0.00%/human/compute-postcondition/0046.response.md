Output State: **`queue` is not empty and contains an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, `visited` contains all reachable nodes from `start` including `neighbor`, `current` is the first element of the tuple removed from the queue and is a key in `tree` with `tree[current]` having at least one element, `dist` is the second element of the tuple removed from the queue, and `neighbor` is in `visited`.**

In natural language: The queue now contains an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`. The `visited` set now includes `neighbor`. All other variables retain their previous states.
