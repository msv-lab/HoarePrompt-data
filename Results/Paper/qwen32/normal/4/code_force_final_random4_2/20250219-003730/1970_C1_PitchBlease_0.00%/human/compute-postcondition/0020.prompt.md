Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree where each key is a node and its value is a list of its neighbors, `queue` is a deque (now empty), `visited` is a set containing the single element `start`, `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0, and `current` is not equal to `target`
Code of the loop:
for neighbor in tree[current]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
        visited.add(neighbor)
        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree where `tree[start]` must have at least one neighbor, `queue` is a deque, `visited` is a set containing the single element `start` and possibly other elements, `current` is equal to `start` or another node, `dist` is a non-negative integer, and `current` is not equal to `target`. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `queue` contains the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` and `visited` includes `neighbor`. Otherwise, `queue` and `visited` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree where `tree[start]` must have at least one neighbor, `queue` is a deque, `visited` is a set containing `start` and possibly other elements, `current` is equal to `start` or another node, `dist` is a non-negative integer, and `current` is not equal to `target`. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `neighbor` is added to `visited` and the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` is appended to `queue`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree where `tree[start]` must have at least one neighbor, `queue` is a deque. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `queue` contains an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` and `visited` includes `start`, `neighbor`, and possibly other elements. If `neighbor` is already in `visited`, `queue` and `visited` remain unchanged. `current` is equal to `start` or another node, `dist` is a non-negative integer, and `current` is not equal to `target`. `neighbor` is the next unvisited neighbor of `current`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
