Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; if `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, then `temp` is `i`, otherwise `temp` remains -1; `ans` is a list containing the value `abs(a[i] - b[i])`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order; `i` is `i + 1`. If `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
