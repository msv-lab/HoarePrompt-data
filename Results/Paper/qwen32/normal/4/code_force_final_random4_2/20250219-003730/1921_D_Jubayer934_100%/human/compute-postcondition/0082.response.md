The code snippet appends a new element to the list `ans`. The new element is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged, and `temp` is not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `ans` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, and the second element is `abs(a[i] - b[i])`, `a` is the list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is the list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, `i` is 1, and `temp` remains unchanged.**
