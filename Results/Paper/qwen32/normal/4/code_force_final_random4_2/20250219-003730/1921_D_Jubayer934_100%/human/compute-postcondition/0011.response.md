The given code snippet appends the absolute difference between the `i`-th element of list `a` and the `i`-th element of list `b` to the list `ans`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `m` is an integer obtained from the input.
- `temp` is `i` if `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, otherwise `temp` remains -1.
- `ans` is an empty list.
- `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input.
- `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.

The code snippet modifies `ans` by appending a new value to it. The new value is `abs(a[i] - b[i])`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `temp` is `i` if `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, otherwise `temp` remains -1; `ans` is a list containing the value `abs(a[i] - b[i])`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.**
