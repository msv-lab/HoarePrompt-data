The code snippet provided assigns the value of `i` to the variable `temp`. This means that the previous value of `temp` is overwritten by the current value of `i`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `ans`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `temp` is `i`; `ans` is a list containing the value `abs(a[i] - b[i])`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order; `i` is `i + 1`.**
