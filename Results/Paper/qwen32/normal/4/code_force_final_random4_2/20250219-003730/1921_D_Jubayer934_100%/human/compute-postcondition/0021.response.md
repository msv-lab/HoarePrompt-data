Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order; `i` is `i + 1`. If `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, then `temp` is set to `i` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `temp` remains unchanged and the loop continues; `ans` is updated to include `abs(a[i] - b[i])`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is that the variable `ans` now includes the absolute difference between the `i`-th element of list `a` and the `i`-th element of list `b`. All other variables retain their previous values unless the condition involving `temp` is met, in which case `temp` is set to `i` and the loop is broken.
