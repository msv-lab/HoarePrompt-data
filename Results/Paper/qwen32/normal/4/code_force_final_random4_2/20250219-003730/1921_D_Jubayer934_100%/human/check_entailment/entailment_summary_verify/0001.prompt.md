You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        temp = -1
        ans = []
        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))[:n]
        b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]
        for i in range(n):
            if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):
                temp = i
                break
            ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))
        if temp != -1:
            for i in range(temp, n):
                ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))
        print(sum(ans))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the minimum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` following a specific pairing strategy, and prints this sum.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires finding the maximum possible difference \( D \) between two arrays \( a \) and \( c \) where \( c \) is constructed from a subset of \( m \) integers \( b \). Specifically, we need to maximize \( D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| \).

### Key Observations
1. **Sorting**: To maximize the absolute differences, we should pair the smallest elements of \( a \) with the largest elements of \( b \) and vice versa. This is because the absolute difference between a small number and a large number is maximized.
2. **Subset Selection**: Since \( m \ge n \), we can always select \( n \) elements from \( b \) to form \( c \).

### Program Analysis
The provided program follows these steps:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads \( n \), \( m \), the array \( a \), and the array \( b \).
2. **Sorting**: It sorts \( a \) in ascending order and \( b \) in descending order.
3. **Pairing Strategy**: It iterates through the elements of \( a \) and \( b \) to pair them in a way that maximizes the absolute differences.
4. **Result Calculation**: It calculates the sum of the absolute differences and prints it.

### Detailed Steps
1. **Sorting**: The arrays are sorted correctly as per the strategy.
2. **Pairing Strategy**: The program uses a greedy approach to determine the best pairing:
   - It initially assumes the best pairing is between the smallest and largest elements.
   - It checks if a different pairing (smallest element of \( a \) with the second largest element of \( b \)) would yield a larger difference.
   - If a better pairing is found, it switches to the new pairing strategy for the rest of the elements.
3. **Result Calculation**: The sum of the absolute differences is calculated and printed.

### Correctness Verification
The program correctly implements the strategy for maximizing the differences by sorting and carefully choosing the pairs. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Conclusion
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the analysis above.
