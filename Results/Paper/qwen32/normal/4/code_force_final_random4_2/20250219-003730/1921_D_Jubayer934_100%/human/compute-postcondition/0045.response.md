The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `m` is the second integer from the input; `temp` is 0 if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`; otherwise, `temp` remains -1; `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order; `i` is 1**
