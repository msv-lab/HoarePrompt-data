The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `m` where `n` is the length of list `a` and `m` is the length of list `b`. Additionally, it accepts a list `a` of `n` integers and a list `b` of `m` integers. Each integer in list `a` and `b` is within the range from 1 to 10^9. The function processes these inputs for each test case and returns a result based on the provided lists.
