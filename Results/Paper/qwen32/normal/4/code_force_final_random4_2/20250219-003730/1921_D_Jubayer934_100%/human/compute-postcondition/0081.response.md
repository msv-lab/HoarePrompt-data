Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `ans` is a list containing one element `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `a` is the list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is the list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, and `i` is 1. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and the element at the position `n - i` from the end of `b` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and the element at position `i` in `b`, then `temp` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `temp` remains -1.**
