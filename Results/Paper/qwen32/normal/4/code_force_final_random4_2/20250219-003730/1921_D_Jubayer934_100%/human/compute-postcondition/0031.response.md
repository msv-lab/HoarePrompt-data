Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `temp` is either -1 or an integer such that 0 ≤ temp < n. If `temp` is not -1, `ans` is a list containing the values `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes, and includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for all `i` in the range from `temp` to `n-1`. If `temp` is -1, `ans` contains the values `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes. `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.**
