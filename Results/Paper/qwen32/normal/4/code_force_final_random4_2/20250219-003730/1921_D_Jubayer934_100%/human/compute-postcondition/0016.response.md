The code snippet appends the value `abs(a[i] - b[i])` to the list `ans`. This means that the list `ans` will have one more element, which is the absolute difference between the `i`-th element of list `a` and the `i`-th element of list `b`. The other variables remain unchanged unless the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is met, in which case `temp` is updated to `i` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. However, since the provided code snippet does not include this conditional check, we will only consider the impact of the `append` operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; if `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, then `temp` is `i`, otherwise `temp` remains -1; `ans` is a list containing the value `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and the newly appended value `abs(a[i] - b[i])`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order; `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the list `ans` now includes an additional element which is the absolute difference between the `i`-th element of list `a` and the `i`-th element of list `b`. All other variables remain as they were.
