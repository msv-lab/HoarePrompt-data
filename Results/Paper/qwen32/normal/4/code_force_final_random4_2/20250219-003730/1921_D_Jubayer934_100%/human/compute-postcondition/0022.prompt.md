Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `temp` is -1; `ans` is an empty list; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):
        temp = i
        break
    ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `temp` is `i` if `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, otherwise `temp` remains -1; `ans` is a list containing the value `abs(a[i] - b[i])`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; if `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, then `temp` is `i`, otherwise `temp` remains -1; `ans` is a list containing the value `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and the newly appended value `abs(a[i] - b[i])`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order; `i` is `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order; `i` is `i + 1`. If `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, then `temp` is set to `i` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `temp` remains unchanged and the loop continues; `ans` is updated to include `abs(a[i] - b[i])`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
