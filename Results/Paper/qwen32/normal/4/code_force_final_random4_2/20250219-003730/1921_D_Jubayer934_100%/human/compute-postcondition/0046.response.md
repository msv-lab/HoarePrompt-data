The code snippet provided assigns the value of `i` to the variable `temp`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `temp` will now hold the value 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `ans`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `m` is the second integer from the input; `temp` is 1; `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order; `i` is 1**.
