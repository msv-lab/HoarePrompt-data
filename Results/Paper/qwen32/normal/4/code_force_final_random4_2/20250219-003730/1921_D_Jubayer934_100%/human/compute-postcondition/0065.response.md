To determine what will be printed by the `print(sum(ans))` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and how the variables `a`, `b`, `temp`, and `ans` are defined.

1. **Variables `a` and `b`**:
   - `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input. This means `a` is sorted in ascending order.
   - `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.

2. **Variable `temp`**:
   - `temp` is the index `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is first met, or -1 if this condition is never met.
   - This means `temp` is the first index where the absolute difference between `a[i]` and the element in `b` that is symmetric to `a[i]` from the end (`b[-(n - i)]`) is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and the corresponding element in `b` (`b[i]`).

3. **Variable `ans`**:
   - If `temp` is not -1, `ans` contains the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from `temp` to `n - 1`.
   - If `temp` is -1, `ans` contains the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n - 1`.

4. **The `print(sum(ans))` statement**:
   - This statement prints the sum of the elements in `ans`.

### Explanation of `ans`:
- If `temp` is not -1, `ans` contains the absolute differences from the index `temp` to the end of the list `a` (or until `n-1`).
- If `temp` is -1, `ans` contains the absolute differences for the entire list `a`.

### Calculation of `sum(ans)`:
- The sum of `ans` will be the sum of the absolute differences between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` starting from `temp` to `n-1` if `temp` is not -1, or from `0` to `n-1` if `temp` is -1.

### Final Output:
The `sum(ans)` will be the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `b` starting from the index `temp` to `n-1` if `temp` is not -1, or from `0` to `n-1` if `temp` is -1.

Output: **sum(ans) (where ans is the list of absolute differences between a[i] and b[i] from index temp to n-1 if temp is not -1, otherwise from 0 to n-1)**
