Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `temp` is an integer `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` for some `i` in the range of the loop; `ans` is a list containing the values `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order. The current value of `temp` is not -1.**
