Let's break down the given initial state and determine what the `print(sum(ans))` statement will output.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). This is a loop control variable typically used in scenarios where multiple test cases are processed.
2. **`n`**: An integer greater than 0. This variable represents the number of elements in list `a`.
3. **`m`**: The second integer from the input. This variable represents the number of elements in list `b`.
4. **`temp`**: Either -1 or an integer less than `n`. This value determines the size of list `ans`.
5. **`ans`**: 
   - If `temp` is -1, `ans` is a list containing `n` elements.
   - If `temp` is less than `n`, `ans` is a list containing \(2n - \text{temp}\) elements.
6. **`a`**: A list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input.
7. **`b`**: A list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.
8. **`i`**: Set to `n`. This variable is not directly used in the `print(sum(ans))` statement but could be relevant in other parts of the code.

### Focus on `print(sum(ans))`:
- The output of `print(sum(ans))` depends on the contents of the list `ans`.
- The size of `ans` is determined by the value of `temp`:
  - If `temp` is -1, `ans` has `n` elements.
  - If `temp` is less than `n`, `ans` has \(2n - \text{temp}\) elements.
- The actual values of the elements in `ans` are not specified in the initial state, so we can't compute the exact sum.

### Conclusion:
Given the information, we can describe the output in terms of the sum of the elements in `ans` without knowing the exact values of the elements.

### Final Output Description:
The `print(sum(ans))` statement will print the sum of the elements in the list `ans`. The size of `ans` is determined by the value of `temp`:
- If `temp` is -1, `ans` has `n` elements.
- If `temp` is less than `n`, `ans` has \(2n - \text{temp}\) elements.

Since the exact values of the elements in `ans` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical sum. However, we can describe the output based on the given conditions.

Output: **sum(ans) (where ans is a list of n elements if temp is -1, or 2n - temp elements if temp is less than n)**
