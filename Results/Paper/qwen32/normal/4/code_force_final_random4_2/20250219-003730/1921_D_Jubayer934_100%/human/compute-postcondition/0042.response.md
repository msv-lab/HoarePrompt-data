Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `m` is the second integer from the input; `temp` is 0; `ans` is an empty list; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order; `i` is 0; the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `temp`, `ans`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
