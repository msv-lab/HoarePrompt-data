The code snippet `j -= 1` decrements the value of `j` by 1. Given the initial state, `j` is initially `len(b)`, and after the decrement, `j` becomes `len(b) - 1`. The values of `dp`, `i`, `l`, and the conditions regarding `dp[i][j]` and its comparisons with `dp[i][j - 1]` and `dp[i - 1][j]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence of `a[:i]` and `b[:j]` for all `i` from 0 to `len(a)` and `j` from 0 to `len(b)`. The final value `dp[len(a)][len(b)]` contains the length of the longest common subsequence between `a` and `b`. `i` is `len(a) - 1` and must be greater than 0, `j` is `len(b) - 1` and must be greater than 0, `l` is an empty list. `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]` and `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`.**
