To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables `i` and `j` as they are the only variables in the loop head.

The `while` loop condition is `i != 0 and j != 0`. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, both `i` and `j` must be non-zero.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence of `a[:i]` and `b[:j]`.
- The final value `dp[len(a)][len(b)]` contains the length of the longest common subsequence between `a` and `b`.
- If `dp[i][j] == dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is `len(a) - 1` and `j` is `len(b) - 2`.
- Otherwise, `i` is `len(a) - 2` and `j` is either `len(b) - 1` or `len(b) - 2` depending on whether `dp[i][j] == dp[i - 1][j]`.
- `l` is either an empty list or a list containing `a[i]` or `a[i + 1]`, and in some cases, it may contain both `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `i` and `j` such that both are non-zero. The current values of `i` and `j` are either `len(a) - 1` and `len(b) - 2`, `len(a) - 2` and `len(b) - 1`, or `len(a) - 2` and `len(b) - 2`.

To make the loop execute one more time, we need to decrement `i` and `j` by 1, ensuring they remain non-zero.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence of `a[:i]` and `b[:j]`. `i` is `len(a) - 2` and `j` is `len(b) - 3` or `i` is `len(a) - 3` and `j` is `len(b) - 2` or `i` is `len(a) - 3` and `j` is `len(b) - 3`. `l` is either an empty list or a list containing `a[i]` or `a[i + 1]`, and in some cases, it may contain both `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`.**
