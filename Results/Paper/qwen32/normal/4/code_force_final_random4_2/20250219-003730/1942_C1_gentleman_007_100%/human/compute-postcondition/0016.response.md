The code snippet appends the `node` to the list `q`. This means that `q` will now include `node` as one of its elements. The other variables (`ver`, `graph`, `vis`, and `node`) remain unchanged in terms of their values or states.

Output State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` must have at least one more adjacent vertex, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, with `vis[ver]` set to 1, `node` is the next unprocessed adjacent vertex in `graph[ver]`, and `q` now includes `node` as one of its elements.**
