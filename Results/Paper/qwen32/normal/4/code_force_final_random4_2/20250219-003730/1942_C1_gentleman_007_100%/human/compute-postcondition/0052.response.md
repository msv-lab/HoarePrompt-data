Postcondition: **`ver` is the value of the element that was at the front of `q` before the operation, `graph` remains unchanged, `vis` has 1s for all nodes that were adjacent to `ver` and were not previously visited, and if `vis[node]` was False, `node` is appended to the end of `q` and `vis[node]` is set to 1. If `vis[node]` was True, `q` contains the elements that were originally in `q` excluding the first element without appending `node`.**
