Output State: **`ver` is the value of the element that was at the front of `q` before the operation, `graph` remains unchanged, `vis` has 1s for all nodes that were adjacent to `ver` and were not previously visited, `q` contains the elements that were originally in `q` excluding the first element plus `node`, `graph[ver]` must have at least one element, `node` is the first element of `graph[ver]`, and `vis[node]` is 0.**

In natural language: The output state is that `ver` retains its original value, `graph` remains unchanged, `vis` still has 1s for all nodes adjacent to `ver` that were not previously visited, `q` now includes all its original elements except the first one, plus the new element `node`, `graph[ver]` still has at least one element, `node` is still the first element of `graph[ver]`, and `vis[node]` remains 0.
