Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `ver`, which is an integer representing a vertex in the graph. It also accepts `graph`, which is a dictionary or list of lists where each index represents a vertex and the corresponding value is a list of adjacent vertices. Additionally, it accepts `vis`, which is a list of integers used to keep track of visited vertices such that `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise. The function performs a depth-first search starting from vertex `ver` and marks the visited vertices in `vis`. The function does not return a value explicitly, but it modifies the `vis` list to reflect the visited status of the vertices.**
