Output State: **`ver` is the last node processed, `graph` remains unchanged, `vis` has 1s for all nodes reachable from the initial `ver` node, and `q` is empty.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, the last vertex processed is stored in `ver`. The `graph` structure remains unchanged throughout the loop. The `vis` list will have 1s for all nodes that can be reached directly or indirectly from the initial vertex `ver`, indicating that all these nodes have been visited. Finally, the queue `q` will be empty, as all elements have been processed and removed from it.
