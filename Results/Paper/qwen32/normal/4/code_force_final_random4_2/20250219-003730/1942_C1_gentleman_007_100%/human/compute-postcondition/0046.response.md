Output State: **`ver` is the value of the element that was at the front of `q` before the operation; `graph` remains unchanged; `vis` has 1s for all nodes that were adjacent to `ver` and were not previously visited except for the next unprocessed node; `q` contains the elements that were originally in `q` excluding the first element, with `node` appended to the end; `node` is the next unprocessed node in `graph[ver]`.**

In simpler terms, the only change is that `node` has been added to the end of the queue `q`. All other variables remain in their initial states.
