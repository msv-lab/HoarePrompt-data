The code snippet `ver = q.popleft()` removes the first element from the queue `q` and assigns it to the variable `ver`. Given the initial state, `ver` was already the value of the element at the front of `q`. After executing the code, `ver` retains the value of the element that was at the front of `q` before the operation, but `q` now contains one less element, as the front element has been removed.

Output State: **`ver` is the value of the element that was at the front of `q` before the operation; `graph` remains unchanged; `vis` has 1s for all nodes that were adjacent to `ver` and were not previously visited; `q` contains the elements that were originally in `q` excluding the first element.**
