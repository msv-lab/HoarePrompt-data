The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is:

```python
print(ver, end=' ')
```

Given the initial state:
- `ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph.
- `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where each index represents a vertex and the corresponding value is a list of adjacent vertices.
- `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, with `vis[ver]` set to 1.
- `q` is an empty deque.

The `print` statement will output the value of the variable `ver` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Since the exact value of `ver` is not specified in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of `ver`.

Output: **ver (where ver is the integer representing a vertex in the graph)**
