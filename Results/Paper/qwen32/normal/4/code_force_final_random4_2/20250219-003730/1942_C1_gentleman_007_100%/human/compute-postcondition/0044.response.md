Postcondition: **`ver` is the value of the element that was at the front of `q` before the operation, `graph` remains unchanged, `vis` has 1s for all nodes that were adjacent to `ver` and were not previously visited, `q` contains the elements that were originally in `q` excluding the first element. If `vis[node]` is 0, `q` includes `node` at the end, and `vis[node]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `q` remains unchanged and `vis[node]` remains 0.**
