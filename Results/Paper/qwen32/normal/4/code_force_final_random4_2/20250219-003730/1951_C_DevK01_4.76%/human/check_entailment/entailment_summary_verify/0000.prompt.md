You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

        else:
            w = N.pop()
            mu = k - (n - 1) * m
            cost = mu * w
            n = len(N)
            cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu
        print(cost)
        continue



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a cost value based on the given constraints and the input values.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets given the constraints. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Sorting the Prices**: The program sorts the prices in ascending order. This is not necessarily optimal because the cost increases with each purchase, and sorting does not account for the increasing prices correctly.

2. **Greedy Approach**: The program uses a greedy approach by taking the smallest prices first, but it does not account for the fact that buying tickets on a day increases the prices for subsequent days. The greedy approach might lead to suboptimal solutions because it does not consider the long-term impact of each purchase on future prices.

3. **Handling Remaining Tickets**: The logic for handling the remaining tickets after buying `m` tickets per day is flawed. The program does not correctly calculate the cost when the number of tickets to be bought is not a multiple of `m`.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases effectively. For example, if the number of tickets `k` is less than `m`, the program might not handle this case correctly.

To illustrate the issue, let's consider a specific test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
3 2 3
1 10 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation:**
- Buy 2 tickets on the first day for a cost of 2 (1 + 1).
- The prices for the remaining days become [12, 2].
- Buy 1 ticket on the third day for a cost of 1.
- Total cost: 2 + 1 = 3.

**Program Output:**
The program will likely output a higher cost because it might not correctly account for the increasing prices and the optimal number of tickets to buy each day.

Given these issues, the program is not guaranteed to find the minimum spending for all possible test cases, so it is incorrect.
