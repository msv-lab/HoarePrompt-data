The code snippet provided assigns the values of `L[0]`, `L[1]`, and `L[2]` to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. This changes the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` based on the elements of the list `L`.

Given that:
- `m` was initially `L[1]`
- `k` was initially `L[2]`
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are reassigned from `L[0]`, `L[1]`, and `L[2]` respectively

The output state will reflect these changes. The variables `M`, `L`, `t`, `q`, `N`, `cost`, `w`, and `mu` remain unchanged unless further operations are performed on them.

Output State: **`M` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `t` is `t`, `n` is `L[0]`, `m` is `L[1]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`. If `n * m == k`, `N` is `M[:q]` and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `N` is `M[:q-1]` excluding the last element that was popped, `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`, `w` is the last element that was popped from `N`, and `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`. `k` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged.**
