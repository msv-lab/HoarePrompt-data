Output State: **`M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `t` is `t`; `n` is `len(N)`; `m` is `min(m, k)`; `k` is `k`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is `M[:q]` with the last element removed; `w` is the last element of the original `N`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.**

Explanation: The value of `mu` is calculated as `k - (n - 1) * m`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
