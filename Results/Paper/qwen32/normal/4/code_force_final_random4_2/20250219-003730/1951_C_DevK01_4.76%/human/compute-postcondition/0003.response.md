The code snippet provided assigns a new list `M` by reading a line of input, splitting it into substrings, and converting each substring into an integer. This operation does not affect the previously mentioned variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, or the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The only change is the introduction of the new list `M`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `M` is a list of integers obtained from the new input.**
