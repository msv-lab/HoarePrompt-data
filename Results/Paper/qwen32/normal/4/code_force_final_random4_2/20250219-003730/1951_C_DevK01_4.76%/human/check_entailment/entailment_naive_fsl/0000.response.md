Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets given the constraints. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Sorting the Prices**: The program sorts the prices in ascending order. This is not necessarily optimal because the cost increases with each purchase, and sorting does not account for the increasing prices correctly.

2. **Greedy Approach**: The program uses a greedy approach by taking the smallest prices first, but it does not account for the fact that buying tickets on a day increases the prices for subsequent days. The greedy approach might lead to suboptimal solutions because it does not consider the long-term impact of each purchase on future prices.

3. **Handling Remaining Tickets**: The logic for handling the remaining tickets after buying `m` tickets per day is flawed. The program does not correctly calculate the cost when the number of tickets to be bought is not a multiple of `m`.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases effectively. For example, if the number of tickets `k` is less than `m`, the program might not handle this case correctly.

To illustrate the issue, let's consider a specific test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
3 2 3
1 10 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation:**
- Buy 2 tickets on the first day for a cost of 2 (1 + 1).
- The prices for the remaining days become [12, 2].
- Buy 1 ticket on the third day for a cost of 1.
- Total cost: 2 + 1 = 3.

**Program Output:**
The program will likely output a higher cost because it might not correctly account for the increasing prices and the optimal number of tickets to buy each day.

Given these issues, the program is not guaranteed to find the minimum spending for all possible test cases, so it is incorrect.
