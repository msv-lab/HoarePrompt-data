### Reasoning:

The provided program seems to have a fundamental flaw in its logic for calculating the minimum cost to purchase exactly `k` tickets. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation Logic**:
   - The program sorts the list of prices and then attempts to buy tickets in a way that it buys the cheapest tickets first. However, the logic to distribute the tickets across days and account for the price increase is flawed.
   - The program calculates the number of days `q` it needs to buy tickets by taking the ceiling of `k / m`. This is correct in theory, but the way it distributes tickets and calculates the cost is not correct.
   - The cost calculation involves a complex formula that doesn't correctly account for the increasing prices due to ticket purchases on previous days.

2. **Specific Issues**:
   - The formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` is used to calculate the cost when `n * m == k`. This formula incorrectly assumes that the cost can be calculated by simply summing the cheapest tickets and adding a fixed increment for the number of days, which doesn't account for the increasing prices.
   - The handling of the case when `n * m != k` is also incorrect. The program pops the last element from the list `N` and calculates the cost for the remaining tickets, but the formula used is still incorrect.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the first test case:
     - Input: `n = 4`, `m = 2`, `k = 3`, `a = [8, 6, 4, 2]`
     - The program calculates the cost as `10`, but the optimal way is to buy 1 ticket on the third day for `4` and 2 tickets on the fourth day for `6`, resulting in a total cost of `10`. However, the logic used in the program is not guaranteed to find this optimal solution for all cases.
   - For the second test case:
     - Input: `n = 4`, `m = 2`, `k = 8`, `a = [8, 6, 4, 2]`
     - The program calculates the cost as `64`, which is correct, but this is more of a coincidence than a correct implementation.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the logic and the incorrect handling of the cost calculation, the program is not guaranteed to find the minimum cost for all test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Answer:
Correctness: **False**
