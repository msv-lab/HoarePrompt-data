The code snippet `m = min(m, k)` will update the value of `m` to be the minimum of its current value and `k`. 

If the current value of `m` is already less than or equal to `k`, `m` will remain unchanged. If `m` is greater than `k`, `m` will be set to `k`.

Therefore, the Output State will reflect this change. Here is the Output State in the required format:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `m` is `min(m, k)`, `k`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the new input; `n` is `L[0]`, `m` is `L[1]`, `k` is `L[2]`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `n` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))` if `n * m != k`, otherwise `q-1`; `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` if `n * m == k`, otherwise the first `q-1` elements of `M`; `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`, where `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m` and `w` is `M[q-1]`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `m` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `k`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
