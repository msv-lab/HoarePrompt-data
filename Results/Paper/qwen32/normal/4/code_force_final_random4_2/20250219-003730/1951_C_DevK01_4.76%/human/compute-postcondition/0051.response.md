The code snippet `cost = mu * w` calculates the value of `cost` by multiplying `mu` with `w`. The values of `mu` and `w` are already defined in the initial state. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `t` is `t`; `n` is `len(N)`; `m` is `min(m, k)`; `k` is `k`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is `M[:q]` with the last element removed; `w` is the last element of the original `N`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`; `cost` is `mu * w`.**
