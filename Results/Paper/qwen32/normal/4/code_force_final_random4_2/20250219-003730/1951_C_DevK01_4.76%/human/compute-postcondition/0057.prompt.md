Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer; `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    M = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
    m = min(m, k)
    M.sort()
    q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
    N = M[:q]
    n = len(N)
    if n * m == k:
        cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
    else:
        w = N.pop()
        mu = k - (n - 1) * m
        cost = mu * w
        n = len(N)
        cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu
    print(cost)
    continue


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `m`, `k`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the new input; `n` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))` if `n * m != k`, otherwise `q-1`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `m` is `min(L[1], k)`; `k` is `L[2]`; `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` if `n * m == k`, otherwise the first `q-1` elements of `M`; `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`, where `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m` and `w` is `M[q-1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `t - 1`, `m` is `min(m, k)`, `k` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the new input, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is `L[1]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`. If `n * m == k`, `N` is `M[:q]` and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `N` is `M[:q-1]` excluding the last element that was popped, `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`, `w` is the last element that was popped from `N`, and `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `t` is `t`; `n` is `len(N)` or `q - 1` depending on whether `n * m == k`; `m` is `min(m, k)`; `k` is `k`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is `M[:q]` or `M[:q]` with the last element removed if `n * m != k`; `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu` where `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m` and `w` is the last element of the original `N`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
