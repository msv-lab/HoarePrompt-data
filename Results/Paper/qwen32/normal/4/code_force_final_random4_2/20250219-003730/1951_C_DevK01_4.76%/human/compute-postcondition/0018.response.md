Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `m`, `k`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the new input; `n` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))` if `n * m != k`, otherwise `q-1`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `m` is `min(L[1], k)`; `k` is `L[2]`; `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` if `n * m == k`, otherwise the first `q-1` elements of `M`; `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`, where `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m` and `w` is `M[q-1]`.**
