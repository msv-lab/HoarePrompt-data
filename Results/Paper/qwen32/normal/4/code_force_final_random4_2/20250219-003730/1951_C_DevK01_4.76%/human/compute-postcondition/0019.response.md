To determine the output of the `print(cost)` statement, we need to carefully follow the initial state and the definitions of the variables involved.

1. **Inputs and Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
   - `m`, `k`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged.
   - `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the new input.

2. **Derived Variables:**
   - `k` is `L[2]`.
   - `m` is `min(L[1], k)`.
   - `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`.
   - `n` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))` if `n * m != k`, otherwise `q-1`.
   - `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` if `n * m == k`, otherwise the first `q-1` elements of `M`.
   - `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.
   - `w` is `M[q-1]`.

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - `cost` is calculated differently based on whether `n * m == k`:
     - If `n * m == k`, then `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
     - Otherwise, `cost = mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.

Given the complexity of the calculations and the lack of specific input values, we can describe the `cost` in terms of the derived variables.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Determine `k` and `m`:**
   - `k = L[2]`
   - `m = min(L[1], k)`

2. **Calculate `q` and `n`:**
   - `q = int(math.ceil(k / m))`
   - If `n * m == k`, then `n = q`.
   - Otherwise, `n = q - 1`.

3. **Determine `N`:**
   - If `n * m == k`, then `N = M[:q]`.
   - Otherwise, `N = M[:q-1]`.

4. **Calculate `mu` and `w`:**
   - `mu = k - (n - 1) * m`
   - `w = M[q-1]`

5. **Calculate `cost`:**
   - If `n * m == k`, then `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - Otherwise, `cost = mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.

### Final Output Description:

Based on the above steps, the `cost` is calculated using the derived variables and the conditions specified. Since the exact values of `L` and `M` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **cost (where cost is calculated based on the input values of L and M, and the derived variables m, n, q, N, mu, and w as described above)**
