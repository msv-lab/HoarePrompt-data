The code snippet `mu = k - (n - 1) * m` calculates the value of `mu` based on the current values of `k`, `n`, and `m`. The values of `k`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from the initial state, so we can directly use the expressions provided in the initial state to determine the new value of `mu`.

Given the initial state, `mu` is now calculated as `k - (n - 1) * m`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `m` is `min(m, k)`, `k` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the new input, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is `L[1]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` if `n * m == k`, otherwise the first `q-1` elements of `M` excluding the last element that was popped, `cost` is recalculated based on the new value of `q` and other variables, `w` is the last element that was popped from `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`**.
