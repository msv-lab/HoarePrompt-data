The value of `mu` is calculated as `k - (n - 1) * m`. Given the initial state, `n`, `m`, and `k` are already defined, and `mu` is newly assigned based on these values. The other variables (`t`, `L`, `M`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `q`, `N`, `w`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `m` is `min(L[1], k)`; `k` is `L[2]`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `n` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the new input; `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M`; `w` is `M[q-1]`; `n * m` is not equal to `k`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.**
