The value of `m` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `k`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `M` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `n` is `L[0]`; `m` is `min(L[1], k)`; `k` is `L[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `M` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `n` is `L[0]`; `m` is `min(L[1], k)`; `k` is `L[2]`.**
