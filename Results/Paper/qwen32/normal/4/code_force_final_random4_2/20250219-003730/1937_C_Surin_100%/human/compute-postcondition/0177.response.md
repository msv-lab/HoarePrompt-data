Output State: **`kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest i for which r was '<', or 0 if r was never '<', `i` is 1, `prev` is 1, `v2` is n-1, `r` is an input value, and `r` is equal to '>'**

In the output state, the value of `prev` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
