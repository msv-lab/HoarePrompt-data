The code snippet `r = input()` takes a new user input and assigns it to the variable `r`. This means that the value of `r` will change to whatever the user inputs. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which the user input `r` was `<` or `0` if no such input was received, `i` is `n`, `r` is the new user input, `r2` is the new user input if `r` is `'='`. If `r` is `'>'`, `prev` is `n-1`. If `r` is `'='` and `r2` is `'<'`, `prev` is `n-1`. Otherwise, if `r` is not `'='` or `r2` is not `'<'`, `prev` remains 0.**
