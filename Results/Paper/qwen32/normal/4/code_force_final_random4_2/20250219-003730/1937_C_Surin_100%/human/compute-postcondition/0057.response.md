Postcondition: **`kp` is 0, `n` is the input integer that must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was `'<'` during the iterations, `i` is 2, `r` is the input string. If `r` is `'>'`, no changes are made to `prev`. If `r` is `'='`, `r2` is the new input string and if `r2` is `'<'`, then `prev` is set to 2. If `r` is neither `'>'` nor `'='`, no changes are made to `prev`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block, considering all possible values of `r` and their respective effects on `prev`.
