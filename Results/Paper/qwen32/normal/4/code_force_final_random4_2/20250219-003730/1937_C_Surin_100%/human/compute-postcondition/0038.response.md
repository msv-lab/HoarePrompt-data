Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `kp` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was `'<'` during the iterations (since no iterations have occurred yet, this value is not explicitly defined but we can infer it's not used in the print statement).
- `i` is 1.
- `prev` is 0.
- `r` is `'='`.

### Print Statement:
```
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement uses an f-string to format the output.
- The variables `i` and `prev` are explicitly mentioned in the print statement.
- The value of `i` is 1.
- The value of `prev` is 0.

### Output:
The print statement will substitute the values of `i` and `prev` into the formatted string.

Output: **? 1 1 0 0**
