Output State: **`kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the user input and `r` is equal to `<`, `prev` is the final value updated based on the responses `r` and `r2`.**

Explanation: The value of `v1` is updated to be equal to `v2`, so `v1` now holds the value `n-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
