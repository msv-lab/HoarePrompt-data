Output State: **`kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if `r` was never '<', `i` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is an input value, `r2` is an input value, `prev` is 1 if `r2` is '<', otherwise `prev` remains 0.**

In natural language: The variable `r2` is assigned the value of the next input. The values of `kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `i`, `v2`, and `r` remain unchanged. The variable `prev` is set to 1 if `r2` is '<', otherwise it remains 0.
