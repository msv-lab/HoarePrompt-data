Let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state step by step:

- `kp` is 1: This variable is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.
- `n` must be greater than 1: This is a constraint on `n`, but `n` itself is not directly printed.
- `g` is 0: This variable is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.
- `v1` is 0: This variable is used in the print statement.
- `i` is `n-1`: This variable is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.
- `prev` is the final value updated based on the responses `r` and `r2`: This variable is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.
- `v2` is `n-1`: This variable is used in the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```
Given that `v1` is 0 and `v2` is `n-1`, we can substitute these values into the print statement.

The output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 [n-1] [n-1] (where [n-1] is the value of v2, which is n-1)**

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we describe `v2` as `n-1`. Here is the final output formatted as requested:
Output: **? 0 0 n-1 n-1 (where n-1 is the value of v2, which is n-1)**
