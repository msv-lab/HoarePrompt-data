Output State: **`kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which the user input `r` was `<` or `0` if no such input was received, `i` is `n`, `prev` is the final value determined by the loop based on user inputs `r` and `r2`.**

### Explanation:
- **`kp`**: Remains 1 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains greater than 1 as it is the condition for the loop to execute.
- **`g`**: Remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`v1`**: Remains the largest `i` for which the user input `r` was `<` or `0` if no such input was received, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes all iterations, `i` will be `n` because the loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`, and `i` is incremented automatically by the loop construct.
- **`prev`**: The final value of `prev` is determined by the user inputs `r` and `r2` during each iteration of the loop. If `r` is `'>'`, `prev` is set to the current `i`. If `r` is `'='` and `r2` is `'<'`, `prev` is also set to the current `i`. Otherwise, `prev` remains unchanged. After all iterations, `prev` holds the final value as determined by these conditions.

This final state encapsulates the result of all user interactions during the loop's execution, specifically how `prev` was updated based on the inputs `r` and `r2`.
