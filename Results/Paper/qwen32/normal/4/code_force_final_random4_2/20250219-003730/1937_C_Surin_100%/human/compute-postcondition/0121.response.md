Output State: **`kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which the user input `r` was `<` or `0` if no such input was received, `i` is `n-1`, `r` is the new user input, `prev` is `n-1`, `r2` is the new user input if `r` is `'='`**

In this output state, the only change is that `prev` has been updated to the value of `i`, which is `n-1`. All other variables retain their initial values.
