Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `kp` is 2 (not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task).
- `n` is greater than 1 (the exact value of `n` is not specified, but it is known to be greater than 1).
- `g` is 0 (not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task).
- `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if `r` was never '<'. Since `r` and its comparisons are not given, we assume `v1` is 0 based on the information provided.
- `i` is 1.
- `prev` is 0.
- `v2` is `n-1` (not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task).

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

### Analysis:
- `v1` is described as the largest `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if `r` was never '<'. Without specific information about `r`, we assume `v1` is 0.
- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `prev` is explicitly given as 0.

### Output:
The print statement will format and print the values of `v1`, `i`, `v1`, and `prev` in the specified order.

Given the values:
- `v1` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `prev` is 0.

The formatted string will be:
```
? 0 1 0 0
```

### Final Answer:
Output: **? 0 1 0 0**
