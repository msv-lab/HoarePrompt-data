Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

- `kp` is 0.
- `n` is the input integer that must be greater than 3.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was `'<'` during the iterations.
- `i` is 3.
- `r` is the input string.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

From the initial state provided:
- `v1` is defined as the largest `i` for which `r` was `'<'` during the iterations. However, since there is no information about any iterations or the value of `r` during any iterations, `v1` is not explicitly defined and could be any value. For the sake of this problem, we can assume it retains its default value if not changed, which is not specified here. Since it's not specified and no iterations are described, we can consider `v1` as an undefined or initial value, which might be `None` or 0 if it's initialized that way, but based on the problem statement, it should be the largest `i` for which `r` was `'<'`. Since no such iterations are mentioned, we can consider `v1` as 0 if it was initialized that way.
- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `prev` is not defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown. We need to assume it's not defined or has some default value, but since it's not provided, we'll consider it as an undefined variable.

Given these considerations, the print statement will output the values of `v1`, `i`, `v1`, and `prev` respectively. Since `v1` is not explicitly defined and `prev` is undefined, we can assume `v1` to be 0 if it was initialized that way, and `prev` to be an undefined variable, but for the sake of the problem, we'll assume it's also 0 if it was initialized that way.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 3 0 prev (where v1 is the largest i for which r was '<' during the iterations, and prev is an undefined variable)**

However, since `prev` is not defined, the most precise description we can provide is:
Output: **? 0 3 0 prev (where v1 is the largest i for which r was '<' during the iterations, and prev is an undefined variable)**

If we assume `prev` was also initialized to 0, then:
Output: **? 0 3 0 0**

But since `prev` is not defined, the most accurate output based on the given information is:
Output: **? 0 3 0 prev (where v1 is the largest i for which r was '<' during the iterations, and prev is an undefined variable)**

However, if we need to strictly adhere to the format and assume `prev` is also 0 for the sake of providing a concrete output:
Output: **? 0 3 0 0**
