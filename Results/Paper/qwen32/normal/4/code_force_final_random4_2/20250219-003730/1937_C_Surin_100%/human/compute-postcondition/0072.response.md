The provided code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call does not change the values of any variables; it simply flushes the output buffer. Therefore, the values of `kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `i`, and `prev` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was `'<'` during the iterations, `i` is `n-1`, `prev` is the final value updated based on the responses `r` and `r2`.**
