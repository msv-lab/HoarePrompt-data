Let's break down the given initial state and the `print` statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `kp` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is 0
- `v2` is `i`

### Key Points:
- The variable `v1` is explicitly set to `0`.
- The variable `v2` is set to `i`. However, `i` is not defined in the provided initial state. This means we do not have an explicit value for `v2` based on the given information.

### Print Statement:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

### Explanation:
- The first `{v1}` and the second `{v1}` will both be `0` because `v1` is explicitly set to `0`.
- The third `{v2}` and the fourth `{v2}` will both be `i` because `v2` is set to `i`, and we do not have a specific value for `i`.

### Output:
Given the information, the output will be:
```
? 0 0 i i
```

### Final Answer:
Output: **? 0 0 i i (where i is the value of the variable i)**
