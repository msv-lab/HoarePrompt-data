Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine the output.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `kp` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than `i + 2`.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `i` is `i + 2`.
   - `v2` is `i`.
   - `r` is an input string.
   - If `r` equals `<`, then `v1` is `i + 2`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
   ```

Let's analyze the values of the variables involved in the print statement:

- `v2` is explicitly set to `i`. Since `i` is `i + 2`, it implies that `i` has already been incremented by 2 at some point in the code (though the exact previous value of `i` is not given, we know it has been adjusted).
- `v1` is only defined if `r` equals `<`. If `r` does not equal `<`, `v1` is not defined in the given information. However, since the print statement includes `v1`, we can infer that `r` must be `<` for the code to execute correctly without errors.
- If `r` is `<`, `v1` is set to `i + 2`. Since `v2` is `i`, `v1` will be `v2 + 2`.

Given `r` equals `<`, `v1` will be `v2 + 2`.

Let's denote the value of `i` (and thus `v2`) as `x`. Therefore:
- `v2 = x`
- `v1 = x + 2`

Now, the print statement will output:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```
Substituting the values:
- `v1` is `x + 2`
- `v2` is `x`

So, the output will be:
```
? x+2 x+2 x x
```

Since `x` is the value of `i` (and `v2`), and we don't have an explicit numerical value for `i`, we express the output in terms of `x`.

Output: **? x+2 x+2 x x (where x is the value of i and v2)**
