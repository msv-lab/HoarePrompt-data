Output State: **`kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which the user input `r` was `<` or `0` if no such input was received, `i` is `n-1`, `r` is the new user input, `prev` is `n-1` if `r` is `'>'` and `r2` is `'<'`; otherwise, `prev` remains 0 if `r` is `'='` and `r2` is not `'<'`; `r2` is the new user input**

Explanation: The code snippet `r2 = input('')` reads a new user input and assigns it to the variable `r2`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
