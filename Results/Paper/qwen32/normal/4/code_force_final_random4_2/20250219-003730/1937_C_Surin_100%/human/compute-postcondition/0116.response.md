Postcondition: **`kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which the user input `r` was `<` or `0` if no such input was received, `i` is `n-1`, `r` is either `'>'` or `'='`. If `r` is `'>'`, `prev` is `n-1`. If `r` is `'='`, `r2` is the new user input and `prev` is `n-1` if `r2` is `'<'`; otherwise, `prev` remains 0.**
