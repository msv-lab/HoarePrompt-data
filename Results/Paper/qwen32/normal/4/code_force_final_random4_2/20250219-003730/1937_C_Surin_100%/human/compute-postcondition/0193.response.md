Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `kp` is 2.
2. `n` is greater than 1.
3. `g` is 0.
4. `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if `r` was never '<'.
5. `i` is 2.
6. `v2` is `n-1`.
7. `r` is an input value.
8. If `r` is '>', `prev` is 1.
9. If `r` is '=', `prev` is 1 if `r2` is '<', otherwise `prev` remains 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet is a formatted print statement that outputs a string starting with '?' followed by the values of `i`, `i` again, `prev`, and `prev` again.
- From the initial state, we know that `i` is 2.
- The value of `prev` depends on the value of `r`:
  - If `r` is '>', `prev` is set to 1.
  - If `r` is '=', `prev` is set to 1 if `r2` is '<', otherwise `prev` remains 0.
  - If `r` is '<', `prev` is not explicitly mentioned to be set to any particular value, so we assume it remains 0 unless otherwise stated.

Since the exact value of `r` and `r2` is not provided, we need to consider the possible scenarios for `prev`:
- If `r` is '>', `prev` will be 1.
- If `r` is '=', `prev` will be 1 if `r2` is '<', otherwise `prev` will be 0.
- If `r` is '<', `prev` will be 0 (assuming no other conditions modify it).

Given the lack of specific values for `r` and `r2`, we cannot definitively determine the value of `prev` without additional information. However, we can describe the possible outputs based on the possible values of `prev`.

### Possible Outputs:
1. If `prev` is 1 (when `r` is '>' or `r` is '=' and `r2` is '<'):
   - Output: **? 2 2 1 1**
2. If `prev` is 0 (when `r` is '<' or `r` is '=' and `r2` is not '<'):
   - Output: **? 2 2 0 0**

Since we don't have the exact values for `r` and `r2`, we can only describe the possible outputs based on the given conditions.

However, if we assume the most common scenario or the most straightforward interpretation (i.e., `r` is not specified to be '>' or '=' with `r2` being '<', we might assume `prev` to be 0 unless explicitly stated otherwise).

### Final Answer:
Assuming the most straightforward interpretation where `prev` is 0 unless explicitly stated otherwise:
Output: **? 2 2 0 0**
