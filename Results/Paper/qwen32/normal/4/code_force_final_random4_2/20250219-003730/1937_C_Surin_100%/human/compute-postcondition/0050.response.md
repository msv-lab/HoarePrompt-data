The code snippet `prev = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `prev`. Given that `i` is 2, `prev` will now hold the value 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is the input integer that must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was `'<'` during the iterations, `i` is 2, `r` is the input string, `prev` is 2**.
