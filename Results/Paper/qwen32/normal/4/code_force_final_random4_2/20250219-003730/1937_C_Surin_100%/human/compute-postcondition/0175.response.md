The code `r = input()` assigns the value of `input()` to the variable `r`. The values of the other variables (`kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `i`, `prev`, `v2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest i for which r was '<', or 0 if r was never '<', `i` is 1, `prev` is 0, `v2` is n-1, `r` is an input value.**
