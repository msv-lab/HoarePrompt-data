### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided Python program and its logic against the problem description.

The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove one cube at a time. Therefore, after `n` moves, the number of cubes (`m`) can be achieved if and only if:
- `m` is less than or equal to `n` because you can't have more cubes than the number of moves.
- The difference between `n` and `m` must be even because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and an even number of such changes can result in the specific difference between `n` and `m`.

The program logic is as follows:
1. If `b` (number of moves) equals `c` (number of cubes desired), it prints 'YES'. This is correct because if the number of moves equals the number of cubes desired, you can simply add one cube per move.
2. If `b` is less than `c`, it prints 'NO'. This is correct because in this scenario, it's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
3. If `b` is greater than `c`, it checks if `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd) and prints 'Yes' if true, otherwise 'No'. This is correct because the difference between `b` and `c` must be even to achieve the desired number of cubes through a series of additions and subtractions.

However, there is a mistake in the code where it checks `a % 2 == b % 2` instead of `b % 2 == c % 2`. Here, `a` is the number of test cases, not related to the current test case's `b` and `c` values. The correct check should be `b % 2 == c % 2`.

### Corrected Code Logic:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Correctness:
Since the original program has a logical error in the parity check, the provided program is not entirely correct.

Correctness: **False**
