The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides a detailed description of various variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `i`) and their conditions, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value of the `print` statement is independent of the values of these variables.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
2. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.
3. None of the variables mentioned in the initial state (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `i`) are referenced in the `print` statement.
4. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
