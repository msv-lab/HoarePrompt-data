Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a logical error in determining whether it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Specifically, the condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` is incorrect. Here, `a` is the number of test cases, not the number of moves, and `b` is the number of moves, not the number of cubes.

The correct condition to check should be whether `n - m` is even, because in each move, the number of cubes can either increase or decrease by 1. So, to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, `n - m` must be even (since each pair of moves can either add and then subtract a cube or vice versa, keeping the net change even).

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b >= c and (b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

In this corrected version, we check if `b` (the number of moves) is at least `c` (the desired number of cubes) and if the difference `b - c` is even. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
