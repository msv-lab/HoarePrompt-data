Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- Each of the following `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `m` such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
- `a` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `b` and `c` are integers read from the input.
- `q` is a tuple `(b, c)`.
- The current value of `b` is equal to the current value of `c`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement `print('YES')` is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `q`. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided in the print statement.

### Output:
The print statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
