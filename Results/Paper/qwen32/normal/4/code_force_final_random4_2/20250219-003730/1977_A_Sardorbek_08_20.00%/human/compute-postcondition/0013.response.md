The code snippet provided contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. The initial state describes various variables and conditions, but none of these variables or conditions influence the output of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is hardcoded to output `'No'`, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `q`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes the input format and constraints but does not affect the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement is `print('No')`, which directly outputs the string `'No'`.

Since the `print` statement is not dependent on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state, the output will always be `'No'`.

Output: **No**
