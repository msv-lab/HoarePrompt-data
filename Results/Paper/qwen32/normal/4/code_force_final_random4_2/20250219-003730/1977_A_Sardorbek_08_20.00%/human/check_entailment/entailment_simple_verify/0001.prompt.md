You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if it's correct.

### Problem Analysis
The problem is to determine if, after `n` moves, the tower can have exactly `m` cubes. Each move can either add or remove exactly one cube from the tower. We need to consider the following points:

1. **Initial State**: The tower starts with 0 cubes.
2. **Possible Moves**: Nikita can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube in each move.
3. **Final State**: After `n` moves, the tower should have exactly `m` cubes.

### Key Observations:
1. **Parity (Even/Odd)**: The number of cubes in the tower after `n` moves depends on the parity of `n` and `m`:
   - If `n` is odd, the final number of cubes (`m`) must be odd.
   - If `n` is even, the final number of cubes (`m`) must be even.
2. **Range of Possible Values**: The final number of cubes `m` can be in the range `[0, n]` because each move changes the number of cubes by 1.

### Correct Conditions:
- If `n >= m` and `n % 2 == m % 2`, then it is possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- Otherwise, it is not possible.

### Program Analysis:
Let's analyze the provided code:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)  # This line does nothing and can be removed
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Condition for `b < c`**: The condition `elif b < c:` is incorrect. The number of moves `n` (`b`) can be less than the number of cubes `m` (`c`), but what matters is the parity and the range.
2. **Parity Check**: The condition `elif b % 2 == c % 2:` is correct for checking if the final number of cubes `m` can be achieved after `n` moves, provided `n >= m`.
3. **Case Sensitivity**: The output should be case-insensitive, but the code provides mixed case outputs.

### Corrected Conditions:
- **Correct Condition**: If `b >= c` and `b % 2 == c % 2`, print "Yes" (case-insensitive).
- **Otherwise**: Print "No".

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the incorrect handling of the condition `b < c`. The correct condition should be based on the parity and the range of possible values.

Correctness: **False**
