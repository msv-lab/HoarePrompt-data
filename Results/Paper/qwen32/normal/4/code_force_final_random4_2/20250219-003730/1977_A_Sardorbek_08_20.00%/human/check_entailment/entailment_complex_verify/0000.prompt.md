You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and m such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, each of the following t lines contains two integers `n` and `m` such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is the number of iterations, `i` is equal to `a`, `b` and `c` are the integers read in the last iteration, and `q` is the tuple `(b, c)` from the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`. It then prints 'YES' if `n` is equal to `m`, 'NO' if `n` is less than `m`, and checks if both `n` and `m` are either even or odd to print 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible for Nikita to end up with a tower of `m` cubes after `n` moves. Specifically, the logic in the program is flawed and does not account for all possible scenarios.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Condition `elif b < c:`**: This condition checks if the number of moves `b` is less than the number of cubes `m`. If `b < c`, the program outputs "NO". This is incorrect because if `b` is at least `c` and `b - c` is even, it is possible to end up with `m` cubes by making `c` moves to add cubes and the remaining `b - c` moves to remove cubes in pairs (which cancel each other out).

2. **Condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:`**: This condition checks if the number of test cases `a` (which is irrelevant for each individual test case) modulo 2 is equal to the number of moves `b` modulo 2. This condition is incorrect and irrelevant to the problem. The correct condition should check if `b - c` is even, which means the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes is even, allowing for the possibility of ending up with `m` cubes.

3. **Output Case Sensitivity**: The problem states that the output can be in any case (lowercase or uppercase). While the program does output "Yes" and "No" correctly, it also outputs "YES" and "NO", which is acceptable, but the logic leading to those outputs is incorrect.

### Correct Logic:
- If `m` is greater than `n`, it is impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves, so the answer is "NO".
- Otherwise, if `n - m` is even, it is possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, so the answer is "YES".
- If `n - m` is odd, it is impossible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, so the answer is "NO".

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if c > b:
            print('NO')
        elif (b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected code properly handles all cases as described in the problem statement. The original program fails to do so, hence it is incorrect.
