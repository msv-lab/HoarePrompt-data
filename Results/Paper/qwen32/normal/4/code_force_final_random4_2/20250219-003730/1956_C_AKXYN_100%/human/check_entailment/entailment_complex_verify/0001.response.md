Let's carefully analyze the original assessment and the annotated code to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis Recap
Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in an \( n \times n \) matrix using type 1 and type 2 operations. The operations allow setting a row or a column to any permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

### Solution Explanation Recap
The provided solution performs the following steps:
1. **Matrix Initialization**: Initializes a matrix with rows filled with permutations from 1 to \( n \).
2. **Sum Calculation**: Calculates the sum using the formula:
   \[
   \text{res} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1)
   \]
3. **Output the Sum and Number of Operations**: Prints the sum and 2n as the number of operations.
4. **Operations Description**: Prints operations to set each row and column to the permutation [1, 2, ..., n].

### Verification
Let's verify the correctness of the solution:

#### Sum Calculation
The formula used to calculate the sum is:
\[
\text{res} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1)
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\text{res} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (2i^2 + 3i + 1)
\]
\[
\text{res} = 2\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} i^2 + 3\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} i + \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 1
\]
Using the formulas for the sum of squares and the sum of the first \( n-1 \) integers:
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} i^2 = \frac{(n-1)n(2n-1)}{6}
\]
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} i = \frac{(n-1)n}{2}
\]
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 1 = n
\]
Substituting these in:
\[
\text{res} = 2 \cdot \frac{(n-1)n(2n-1)}{6} + 3 \cdot \frac{(n-1)n}{2} + n
\]
\[
\text{res} = \frac{(n-1)n(2n-1)}{3} + \frac{3(n-1)n}{2} + n
\]
\[
\text{res} = \frac{2(n-1)n(2n-1) + 9(n-1)n + 6n}{6}
\]
\[
\text{res} = \frac{(n-1)n(4n-2+9) + 6n}{6}
\]
\[
\text{res} = \frac{(n-1)n(4n+7) + 6n}{6}
\]
\[
\text{res} = \frac{n(4n^2 + 3n - 1)}{6}
\]
This is indeed the correct formula for the maximum sum achievable.

#### Number of Operations
The solution uses exactly 2n operations, which is within the allowed limit.

#### Operations Description
The operations described ensure that each row and column is set to a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, achieving the maximum sum. However, the operations are described in reverse order, which is not a problem since the operations are independent and the final matrix configuration is correct.

### Conclusion
The provided solution correctly calculates the maximum sum and describes the operations to achieve this sum within the allowed limit of 2n operations.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
