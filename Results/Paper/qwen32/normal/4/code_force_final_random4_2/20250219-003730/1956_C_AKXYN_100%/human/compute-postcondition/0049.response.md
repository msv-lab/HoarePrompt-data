The code modifies the value of `res` by adding the result of the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to it. Given that `i` is initially 0, the expression evaluates to `(0 + 1) * (2 * 0 + 1) = 1 * 1 = 1`. Therefore, `res` changes from 0 to 1. The values of `n`, `mat`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 1, and `i` is 0**.
