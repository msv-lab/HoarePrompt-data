Let's break down the given code and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n` (though `mat` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1` (though `res` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `i` is explicitly set to 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **`'1 %d' % i`**: This part of the print statement is a string formatting expression. It will replace `%d` with the value of `i`. Since `i` is 2, this will be formatted as `'1 2'`.
2. **`*range(1, n + 1)`**: The `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive. The `*` operator unpacks this sequence into individual arguments for the `print` function. Therefore, this will print the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical sequence, but we can describe it in terms of `n`.

### Output:
Given the above analysis, the print statement will output:
- `'1 2'` (from the formatted string).
- Followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`, separated by spaces.

Therefore, the final output will be:
Output: **1 2 1 2 ... n (where n is the value of n)**

Since `n` is not explicitly given, we can't provide the exact sequence of numbers, but we can describe it accurately based on the precondition. If `n` were, for example, 5, the output would be `1 2 1 2 3 4 5`. However, without a specific value for `n`, we describe it in the most precise way possible.

Output: **1 2 1 2 ... n (where n is the value of n)**
