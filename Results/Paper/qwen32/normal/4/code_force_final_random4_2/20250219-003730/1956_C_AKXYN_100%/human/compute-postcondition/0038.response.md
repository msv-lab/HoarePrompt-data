Let's break down the provided code snippet and the initial state.

Initial State:
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `i` is defined as `n - 1`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` is defined as `n - 1`, we know that `i` will be an integer that is one less than `n`.

2. **Formatted String '1 %d' % i:**
   - The `%d` in the string is a placeholder for an integer.
   - The expression `'1 %d' % i` will format the integer `i` into the string, resulting in a string that starts with '1 ' followed by the value of `i`.

3. **Range `range(1, n + 1)`:**
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to and including `n`.
   - This range will produce a list of integers `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.

4. **Combining the Formatted String and the Range:**
   - The `print` function will first output the formatted string `'1 %d' % i`.
   - Then, it will unpack and print the elements of the range `range(1, n + 1)`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `n` is 5 for concreteness (though `n` can be any integer greater than 1):
- `i` would be `5 - 1 = 4`.
- The formatted string `'1 %d' % i` would be `'1 4'`.
- The range `range(1, n + 1)` would be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

### Final Output:
Combining the formatted string and the range, the output would be:
```
1 4 1 2 3 4 5
```

### General Output:
For any `n > 1`:
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- The formatted string is `'1 %d' % (n - 1)`.
- The range is `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **1 [n-1] 1 2 3 ... [n] (where [n-1] is the value of n-1 and [n] is the value of n)**
