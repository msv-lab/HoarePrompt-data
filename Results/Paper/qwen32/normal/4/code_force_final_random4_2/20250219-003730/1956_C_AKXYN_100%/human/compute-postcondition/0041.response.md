Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is defined as `n - 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is defined as `n - 2`. Since `n` is greater than 1, `i` will be a non-negative integer. For example, if `n` is 5, then `i` will be `5 - 2 = 3`.

2. **Formatted String `'1 %d' % i`:**
   - This part of the print statement formats the integer `i` into a string and appends it to the string `'1 '`.
   - Continuing the example where `i` is 3, the formatted string will be `'1 3'`.

3. **`*range(1, n + 1)`:**
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
   - Using the same example where `n` is 5, `range(1, 5 + 1)` will generate the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
   - The `*` operator unpacks this sequence, so it will be printed as individual numbers separated by spaces.

### Combining the Parts:
- The formatted string `'1 %d' % i` is followed by the unpacked range of numbers.
- So, if `n` is 5 and `i` is 3, the output will be `'1 3 1 2 3 4 5'`.

### Generalizing for Any `n`:
- For any `n > 1`, `i` will be `n - 2`.
- The formatted string will be `'1 %d' % (n - 2)`.
- The unpacked range will be the numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 [n-2] 1 2 3 ... n (where [n-2] is the value of n-2 and n is greater than 1)**

To make it more precise and human-readable:
Output: **1 [n-2] 1 2 3 ... n (where [n-2] is the value of n-2 and n is the given number greater than 1)**

For example, if `n` is 5:
Output: **1 3 1 2 3 4 5**
