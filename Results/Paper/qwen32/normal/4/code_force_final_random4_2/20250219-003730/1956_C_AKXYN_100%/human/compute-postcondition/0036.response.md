To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to analyze the components of the statement and the initial state provided.

The print statement is:
```python
print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

1. **Component Breakdown**:
   - `'2 %d' % i`: This part of the statement is a formatted string. `%d` is a placeholder for an integer which will be replaced by the value of `i`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)`: This part of the statement uses the unpacking operator `*` to unpack the elements of the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and print them as separate arguments.

2. **Variables and Initial State**:
   - `n`: The initial state specifies that `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i`: The value of `i` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state. However, since it is used in the formatted string, we need to assume that `i` has some integer value.

3. **Output Analysis**:
   - The first part of the output is `'2 %d' % i`. If `i` has some value, say `k`, then this part will print `2 k`.
   - The second part of the output is `*range(1, n + 1)`. This will print the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) as separate arguments, separated by spaces.

Given that `n` is greater than 0, the range will always include at least one number, which is 1. The exact numbers printed will depend on the value of `n`, but the format will be consistent.

Since the exact value of `i` and `n` are not specified, we describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **2 [i] 1 2 ... n (where [i] is the value of i and n is the value of n, with n > 0)**
