Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, where each iteration processes a matrix of size `n` (as specified by the input). For each test case, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`. The variable `res` is calculated as the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, which simplifies to the formula \(\frac{n(4n^2 + 3n - 1)}{6}\). The variable `i` is 0 at the start of each iteration. The loop prints `res` followed by `n << 1` (which is `2 * n`), and then for each `i` from `n` down to 1, it prints two lines: the first line starting with '1' followed by `i` and the numbers from 1 to `n`, and the second line starting with '2' followed by `i` and the numbers from 1 to `n`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the loop will have processed `t` different matrices, each of size `n` by `n`, and for each matrix, it will have computed and printed a specific sum (`res`), printed `2 * n`, and then printed a series of lines that describe operations on the matrix.
