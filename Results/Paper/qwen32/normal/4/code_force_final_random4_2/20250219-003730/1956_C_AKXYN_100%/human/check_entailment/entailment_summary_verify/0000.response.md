Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to evaluate the correctness of the solution given the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown

The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an `n x n` matrix using up to `2n` operations, where each operation can be one of two types:
1. Type 1: Assign a row `i` with a permutation of numbers from `1` to `n`.
2. Type 2: Assign a column `i` with a permutation of numbers from `1` to `n`.

The maximum possible sum of the matrix, when filled with all numbers from `1` to `n^2`, is:
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{n^2 (n^2 + 1)}{2} \]

### Program Analysis

The provided program processes each test case by:
1. Initializing a matrix with rows filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
2. Calculating a sum `res` using the formula:
   \[ \text{res} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \cdot (2i + 1) \]
3. Printing the calculated sum and the number of operations (`2n`).
4. Printing a sequence of `2n` operations, alternating between filling rows and columns with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

Let's evaluate the correctness of each step:

#### Step 1: Matrix Initialization
The matrix is initialized with each row containing the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This is fine, but it doesn't guarantee the maximum sum.

#### Step 2: Calculation of the Sum
The formula used to calculate the sum:
\[ \text{res} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \cdot (2i + 1) \]
This formula does not match the expected maximum sum of the matrix. The correct formula should be:
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{n^2 (n^2 + 1)}{2} \]

#### Step 3: Printing the Sum and Operations
The program prints the calculated sum and the number of operations (`2n`). The operations are filling rows and columns with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`. However, these operations do not ensure that the matrix will be filled with all numbers from `1` to `n^2` to achieve the maximum sum.

### Correct Approach

To achieve the maximum sum:
- Each row and each column should contain all numbers from `1` to `n` exactly once.
- One possible way to achieve this is to use the following operations:
  - For each row `i`, use the permutation `[i, i+1, ..., n, 1, 2, ..., i-1]`.
  - This ensures that each row and column contains all numbers from `1` to `n` exactly once, achieving the maximum possible sum of `n^2 * (n^2 + 1) / 2`.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum and does not generate the correct sequence of operations to achieve this sum. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

**Final: False**
