Let's break down the given code snippet and initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is defined as `n-1`.

### Code Snippet
```python
print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis
1. **Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is defined as `n-1`, we know that `i` will be one less than `n`. For example, if `n` is 5, then `i` will be 4.

2. **String Formatting**:
   - The string `'2 %d' % i` will format the integer `i` into the string. For example, if `i` is 4, the string will become `'2 4'`.

3. **Range Function**:
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive. For example, if `n` is 5, the range will be `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

4. **Unpacking the Range**:
   - The `*range(1, n + 1)` will unpack the range into individual arguments to the `print` function. This means each number in the range will be printed as a separate item.

### Putting It All Together
- If `n` is 5, then `i` will be 4.
- The string `'2 %d' % i` will be `'2 4'`.
- The `range(1, 6)` will generate the numbers `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.
- The `print` statement will output `'2 4'` followed by the numbers `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

### Final Output
Since `n` is not explicitly given, we can describe the output in terms of `n`:
- The first part of the output will always be `'2 %d' % i`, which translates to `'2 (n-1)'`.
- The second part will be the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Therefore, the output can be precisely described as:
Output: **2 (n-1) 1 2 3 ... (n-1) n (where n is greater than 1)**

However, to provide a more concrete example, let's assume `n` is 5:
Output: **2 4 1 2 3 4 5**
