The code snippet updates the value of `res` by adding the result of the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to it. Given that `i` is initially 1, we can calculate the new value of `res` as follows:

- `i + 1` is `1 + 1` which equals `2`.
- `2 * i + 1` is `2 * 1 + 1` which equals `3`.
- Therefore, `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` is `2 * 3` which equals `6`.
- Adding this to the initial value of `res` (which is `1`), we get `1 + 6` which equals `7`.

The values of `n`, `mat`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 7, and `i` is 1**.
