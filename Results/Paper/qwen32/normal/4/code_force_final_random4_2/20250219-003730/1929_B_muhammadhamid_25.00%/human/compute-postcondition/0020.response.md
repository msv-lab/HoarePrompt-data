The code snippet provided is:
```
n, k = map(int, input().split())
```
This line of code reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k` respectively.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input.
- If `k` equals 1, the state remains unchanged.
- Otherwise, there is no change in the state regardless of whether `k <= 2 * n` or not.

After executing the code, the values of `n` and `k` will be updated to the integers provided in the input, but the value of `t` remains as `t - 1` because it is not affected by the code snippet.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input.**
