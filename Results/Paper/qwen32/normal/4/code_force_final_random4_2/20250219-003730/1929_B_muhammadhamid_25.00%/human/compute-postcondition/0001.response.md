The code provided reads a single line of input and splits it into two integers, `n` and `k`. Given the initial state, the value of `t` (the number of test cases) does not affect the execution of the provided snippet, as `t` is not used in it. Therefore, `t` remains unchanged. The variables `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input.

Output State: **The input must provide an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input.**
