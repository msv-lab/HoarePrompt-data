Postcondition: **The input must provide an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input. If the current value of `k` is 1, then `k` remains 1. If `k` is not 1, `k` retains its original value. Additionally, `k` is less than or equal to 2 times `n`.**
