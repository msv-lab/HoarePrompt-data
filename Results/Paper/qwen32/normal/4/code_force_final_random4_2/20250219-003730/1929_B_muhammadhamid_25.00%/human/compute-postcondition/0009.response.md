To determine the output of the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the information provided in the initial state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
- `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input.
- `k` is greater than `2 * n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(k // 2 + 1)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `k` is known to be greater than `2 * n`, but the specific values of `n` and `k` are not provided.
- The expression `k // 2` performs integer division of `k` by 2, which means it will yield the quotient without the remainder.
- Adding 1 to the result of `k // 2` will give us the final output.

### Output Description:
- Since we don't have specific values for `n` and `k`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `k // 2 + 1`.
- However, we know that `k > 2 * n`, so `k // 2` will be greater than `n`.
- Therefore, `k // 2 + 1` will be an integer greater than `n + 1`.

### Final Output:
The code will print the result of the expression `k // 2 + 1`, where `k` is an integer greater than `2 * n`.

Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is an integer greater than 2 * n)**
