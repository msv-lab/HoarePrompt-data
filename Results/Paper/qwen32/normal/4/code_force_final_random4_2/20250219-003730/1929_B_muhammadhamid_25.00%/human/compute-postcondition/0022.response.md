The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables directly. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input.**
