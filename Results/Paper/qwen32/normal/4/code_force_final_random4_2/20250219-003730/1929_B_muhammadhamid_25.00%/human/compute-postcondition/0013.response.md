The initial state provided does not affect the execution of the `print(1)` statement. The statement `t = t - 1` modifies the value of `t`, but this modification is not relevant to the `print` statement, which simply outputs the integer `1`. The variables `n` and `k` are mentioned as integers obtained from the input, but they are not used in the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print(1)` statement is straightforward: it will print the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
