Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function receives an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2) where n is the size of the square grid and k is the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if k == 1:
        print(1)
        continue
    if k <= 2 * n:
        print(math.ceil(k / 2))
    else:
        print(k // 2 + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The input provides an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input. If `k` is 1, then `k` remains 1. If `k` is not 1 and `k` is less than or equal to 2 times `n`, `k` retains its original value. If `k` is greater than 2 times `n`, then `k` retains its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input. If `k` equals 1, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, there is no change in the state regardless of whether `k <= 2 * n` or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input. Regardless of whether `k` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, no changes are made to `n` or `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
