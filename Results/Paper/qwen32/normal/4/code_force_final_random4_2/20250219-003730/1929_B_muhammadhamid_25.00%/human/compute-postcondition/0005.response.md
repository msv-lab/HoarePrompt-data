Postcondition: **The input must provide an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input. If the current value of `k` is 1, then the postcondition retains the same values for `t` and `n` with `k` being 1. If `k` is not 1, the postcondition still retains the same values for `t` and `n`, and `k` retains its original value.**
