The code snippet assigns new values to `n` and `k` by taking input from the user and splitting it into two integers. The initial state of `t` is `t - 1`, and this value remains unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the integers provided by the user input.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input**.
