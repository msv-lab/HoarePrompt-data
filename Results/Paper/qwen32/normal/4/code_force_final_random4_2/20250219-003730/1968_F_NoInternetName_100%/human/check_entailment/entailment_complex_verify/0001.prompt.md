You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n`, an integer `q`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and for each of `q` queries, it accepts two integers `l` and `r` representing a range within `a`. It then determines for each query whether there exists an index `i` in the range `[l, r]` such that the XOR of all elements from the start of the list up to `i` is equal to the XOR of all elements from the start up to `r`. The function outputs "Yes" if such an index exists, otherwise "No".




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine if a subarray is "interesting." A subarray is considered "interesting" if it can be divided into two or more segments such that the bitwise XOR of all elements in each segment is the same.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - `func_1` reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers.
   - `func_5` reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the number of queries `q`, the array `a`, and the list of queries.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - `x` is a list where `x[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `a`. This helps in quickly computing the XOR of any subarray `a[l:r+1]` as `x[r+1] ^ x[l]`.

3. **Index Mapping**:
   - `inds` is a dictionary that maps each possible XOR value to a list of indices where this XOR value occurs in the prefix XOR list `x`.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query `(l, r)`, the program checks if the XOR of the subarray `a[l-1:r]` is zero (`x[r] == x[l-1]`). If it is, the subarray can trivially be split into any number of segments with the same XOR value (zero).
   - If the XOR is not zero, the program looks for a previous index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` and a subsequent index in `inds[x[l-1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`. If such indices exist, it implies that the subarray can be split into segments with the same XOR value.

### Correctness Verification:
- **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
  - This part is correct. The prefix XOR list `x` is correctly computed such that `x[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of `a`.
  
- **Index Mapping**:
  - The `inds` dictionary is correctly populated with indices for each XOR value, which helps in efficiently finding the required indices for the query.

- **Query Processing**:
  - **Trivial Case**: If `x[r] == x[l-1]`, the subarray can be split into any number of segments with the same XOR value, which is correct.
  - **Non-trivial Case**: The program correctly uses binary search (via `func_2` and `func_3`) to find the required indices in `inds[x[r]]` and `inds[x[l-1]]`. The logic here is correct as well, as it ensures that there is a valid split point in the subarray.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "interesting" based on the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
