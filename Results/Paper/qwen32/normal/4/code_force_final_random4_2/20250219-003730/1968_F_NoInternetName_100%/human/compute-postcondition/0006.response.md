The code snippet `x.append(x[-1] ^ i)` appends a new element to the list `x`. The new element is the result of the XOR operation between the last element of `x` and the variable `i`. Given the initial state, `x` is a list containing the single element `0`. Therefore, `x[-1]` is `0`. The new element appended to `x` will be `0 ^ i`, which simplifies to `i` because `0` XOR any number `i` is `i`.

Thus, after the code execution, `x` will be a list containing two elements: the original `0` and the new element `i`.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is the list returned by `func_1(int)` and must have at least one element, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n, `x` is a list containing the elements `[0, i]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where `inds[0]` is `[0]`**.
