To determine the output of the `print('Yes')` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand how the variables are defined and used. However, the `print('Yes')` statement itself does not depend on the values of any of the variables or the results of any functions. It simply prints the string 'Yes'.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the information provided:

- `x` is a list constructed based on the elements of `a` with zeros inserted at even indices.
- `inds` is a defaultdict that maps `0` to a list of even indices and each element `a[j]` for odd `j` to the list containing `j`.
- `q` is a positive integer.
- `i` is set to 2.
- `l` and `r` are values returned by `func_1(int)`.
- `lower` is determined by finding an index in `inds[x[r]]` where the value is less than `l`, or defaulting to 0.
- `upper` is determined by finding an index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the value is less than or equal to `r`.

Despite all these definitions and calculations, the `print('Yes')` statement does not use any of these variables or calculations. It simply outputs the string 'Yes'.

Output: **Yes**
