The code snippet `x.append(x[-1] ^ i)` appends a new element to the list `x`. The new element is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the last element of `x` and the variable `i`.

Given:
- `x` is initially `[0, i, 0]`
- `i` is the third element of the list `a`, which means `a[2]` is `i`.

The last element of `x` is `0`. Therefore, the new element appended to `x` is `0 ^ i`, which simplifies to `i` because XOR with 0 does not change the value.

Thus, the new list `x` becomes `[0, i, 0, i]`.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is the list returned by `func_1(int)` and must have at least two elements, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n, `x` is `[0, i, 0, i]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where `inds[0]` is `[0, 2]` and `inds[i]` is `[1]`, `i` is the third element of `a`**.
