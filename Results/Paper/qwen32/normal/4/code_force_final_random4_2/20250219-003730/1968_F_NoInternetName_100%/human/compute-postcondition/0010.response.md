The code snippet `inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)` appends the index of the last element of the list `x` to the list associated with the key `x[-1]` in the `inds` dictionary.

Given that `x` is `[0, i, 0]`, the last element of `x` is `0`. Therefore, `x[-1]` is `0`. The length of `x` is `3`, so `len(x) - 1` is `2`. This means that the value `2` will be appended to the list associated with the key `0` in the `inds` dictionary.

Initially, `inds[0]` is `[0]`. After appending `2`, `inds[0]` becomes `[0, 2]`.

The other variables (`n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is the list returned by `func_1(int)` and must have at least one element, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n, `x` is `[0, i, 0]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where `inds[0]` is `[0, 2]` and `inds[i]` is `[1]`, `i` is the second element of `a`**.
