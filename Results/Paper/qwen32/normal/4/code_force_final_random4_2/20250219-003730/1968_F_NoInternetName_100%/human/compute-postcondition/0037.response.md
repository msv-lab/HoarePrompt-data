Let's analyze the given code and initial state step-by-step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **List `x`:**
   - `x` is constructed based on the list `a`.
   - If `k` (length of `a`) is odd, `x` is `[0, a[0], 0, a[2], 0, a[4], ..., 0, a[k-1]]`.
   - If `k` is even, `x` is `[0, a[0], 0, a[2], 0, a[4], ..., a[k-1]]`.

2. **Defaultdict `inds`:**
   - `inds[0]` contains indices `[0, 2, 4, ..., 2*floor(k/2)]`.
   - `inds[a[j]]` contains `[j]` for each odd `j`.

3. **Variables `q`, `i`, `l`, `r`:**
   - `q` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is set to 1.
   - `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`.

4. **Variables `lower` and `upper`:**
   - `lower` is determined by `inds[x[r]]` and a function that finds the first index in `inds[x[r]]` where the value is less than `l`. If no such index exists, it defaults to 0.
   - `upper` is determined by `inds[x[l - 1]]` and a function that finds the first index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the value is less than or equal to `r`.

5. **Comparison:**
   - The code checks if `upper` is greater than `lower`. If it is, it implies a certain condition is met; otherwise, it implies a different condition.

### Code Analysis

The given code snippet is:

```python
print('No')
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the string `'No'`. The values of the variables `x`, `inds`, `q`, `i`, `l`, `r`, `lower`, and `upper` do not affect the output of this specific print statement. The condition described in the initial state does not influence the print statement because it does not depend on the comparison result for its output.

### Conclusion

The code will print the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
