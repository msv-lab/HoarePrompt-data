### Reasoning:

To determine if the provided Python program is correct, we need to carefully analyze each function and how they collectively address the problem statement.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads a line of input, splits it into components, and applies a casting function to each component. It is used for reading integers from the input.
   - It is correctly used in the main loop to read the number of test cases and in `func_5` to read the array and query inputs.
   
2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function performs a binary search on a list `arr` to find the largest index `l` such that `predicate(arr[l])` is `True`.
   - The binary search algorithm is correctly implemented.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function is a simple wrapper around `func_2`, passing the same arguments to it.
   - It doesn't add any additional functionality but makes the code more modular.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function calls `func_2` and, if the result is not `None`, adds 1 to the result before returning it.
   - It is used to adjust the indices returned by the binary search to account for 1-based indexing in the problem statement.

5. **Function `func_5`**:
   - This function handles each test case. It reads the array `a` and computes a prefix XOR array `x`, where `x[i]` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i-1`.
   - It uses a dictionary `inds` to store the indices where each XOR value occurs.
   - For each query, it checks if the subarray `a[l-1:r]` can be split into parts with equal XOR values.
   - The function uses `func_4` and `func_3` to find the appropriate indices in the `inds` dictionary to determine if such a split is possible.

### Analysis of Function `func_5`:

- **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
  - The prefix XOR array `x` is correctly computed. `x[i]` represents the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i-1`.
  
- **Index Dictionary `inds`**:
  - The dictionary `inds` stores the indices where each XOR value occurs. This allows for efficient lookup of indices for specific XOR values.
  
- **Query Handling**:
  - For each query `(l, r)`, the function first checks if `x[l-1] == x[r]`. If true, it means the subarray `a[l-1:r]` itself has an XOR of `0`, which implies it can be split into parts with equal XOR values (specifically, the subarray itself).
  - If `x[l-1] != x[r]`, the function uses the `inds` dictionary to find the appropriate indices to determine if there exists an index `i` in the range `[l, r]` such that the XOR of the subarray `a[l-1:i]` is equal to the XOR of the subarray `a[i:r]`. This is done using `func_4` and `func_3` to find the correct indices in `inds`.
  - If such an index `i` exists, the function outputs "Yes"; otherwise, it outputs "No".

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if a subarray is interesting by leveraging prefix XOR values and efficient index lookups. All functions work together to solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
