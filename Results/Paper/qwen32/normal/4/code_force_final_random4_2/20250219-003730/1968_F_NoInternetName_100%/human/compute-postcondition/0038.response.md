Postcondition: **`x` is `[0, a[0], 0, a[2], 0, a[4], ..., 0, a[k-1]]` if `k` is odd, or `[0, a[0], 0, a[2], 0, a[4], ..., a[k-1]]` if `k` is even; `inds` is a defaultdict where `inds[0]` is `[0, 2, 4, ..., 2*floor(k/2)]` and `inds[a[j]]` is `[j]` for odd `j`; `q` is greater than 0; `i` is 1; `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`; `lower` is `inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]`; `upper` is `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]`. The relationship between `upper` and `lower` is that if `upper` is greater than `lower`, then `upper` is indeed greater than `lower`. Otherwise, `upper` is not greater than `lower`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block, maintaining the conditions and relationships described in the precondition and the specific conditions of the if and else parts.
