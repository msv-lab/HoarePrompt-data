The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`. According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in the list `a` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the second element of `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be updated to the next element in the list `a`.

Let's denote the elements of the list `a` as `a[0], a[1], a[2], ...`. Since `i` was `a[1]` (the second element) at the end of the last iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be `a[2]` (the third element).

State: **`n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is the list returned by `func_1(int)` and must have at least two elements, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n, `x` is `[0, i, 0]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where `inds[0]` is `[0, 2]` and `inds[i]` is `[1]`, `i` is the third element of `a`**
