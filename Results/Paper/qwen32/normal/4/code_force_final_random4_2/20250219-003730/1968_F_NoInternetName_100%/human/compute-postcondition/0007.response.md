The code snippet appends the index of the last element of the list `x` to the list stored in `inds` under the key `x[-1]`. Given that `x` is `[0, i]`, the last element of `x` is `i` and its index is `1`. Therefore, `inds[i]` will be updated to include `1`.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is the list returned by `func_1(int)` and must have at least one element, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n, `x` is a list containing the elements `[0, i]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where `inds[0]` is `[0]` and `inds[i]` is `[1]`.**
