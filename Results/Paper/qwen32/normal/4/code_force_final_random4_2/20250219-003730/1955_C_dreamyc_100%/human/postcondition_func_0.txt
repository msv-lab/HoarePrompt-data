The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the length of the list `nums`), `k` (an integer), and `nums` (a list of integers). It returns `n` if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in `nums`. Otherwise, it calculates and returns `ans`, which is the count of iterations where the cumulative sum of elements from the start (`s_a`) is less than or equal to `a` or the cumulative sum of elements from the end (`s_b`) is less than or equal to `b`.
