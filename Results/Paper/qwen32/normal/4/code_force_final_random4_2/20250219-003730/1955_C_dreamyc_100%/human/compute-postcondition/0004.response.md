The code snippet provided initializes a variable `ans` to 0. None of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `nums`, `a`, `b`) are modified by this code. Therefore, their values remain as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `b` is `k // 2`, `ans` is 0.**
