Let's analyze the provided program and determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

The problem requires us to simulate the Kraken's attacks on a sequence of ships, where the Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ship until either all ships have sunk or the given number of attacks have been made. The task is to determine how many ships have sunk after the Kraken's attacks.

The given program does not correctly simulate the sequence of attacks as described in the problem statement. Instead, it attempts to determine the number of ships that would sink if the Kraken attacked the ships in a way that the sum of the durability of the first `a` ships (where `a = ceil(k/2)`) and the sum of the durability of the last `b` ships (where `b = k//2`) were less than or equal to `a` and `b`, respectively. This approach does not accurately simulate the alternating attack pattern.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the issues:
1. The program calculates `a` and `b` as `ceil(k/2)` and `k//2`, respectively, which does not correspond to the number of attacks on the first and last ships, respectively.
2. The program sums the durability of ships from the start and end until the cumulative sum exceeds `a` and `b`. This does not simulate the alternating attack pattern.
3. The program does not account for the fact that ships sink when their durability reaches 0 and are no longer attacked.
4. The program does not correctly handle the case where the Kraken attacks more times than the total durability of all ships.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should simulate the alternating attack pattern, decrementing the durability of the first and last ships until they sink or the Kraken has made `k` attacks. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ans = 0
    ships = deque(nums)
    while k > 0 and ships:
        if ships[0] > 0:
            ships[0] -= 1
            if ships[0] == 0:
                ans += 1
                ships.popleft()
        k -= 1
        if k > 0 and ships:
            if ships[-1] > 0:
                ships[-1] -= 1
                if ships[-1] == 0:
                    ans += 1
                    ships.pop()
            k -= 1
    print(ans)
```

Given the above analysis, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
