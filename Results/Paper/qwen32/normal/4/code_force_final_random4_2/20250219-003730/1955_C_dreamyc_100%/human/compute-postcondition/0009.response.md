The code snippet `s_b += nums[n - i - 1]` increments `s_b` by the value of the element at the index `n - i - 1` in the `nums` list. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so `n - i - 1` evaluates to `n - 1`. Therefore, `s_b` is incremented by `nums[n - 1]`.

Given that `s_b` was initially 0, after this operation, `s_b` becomes `nums[n - 1]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `b` is `k // 2`, `ans` is 0, `s_a` is `nums[0]`, `s_b` is `nums[n - 1]`, `i` is 0**
