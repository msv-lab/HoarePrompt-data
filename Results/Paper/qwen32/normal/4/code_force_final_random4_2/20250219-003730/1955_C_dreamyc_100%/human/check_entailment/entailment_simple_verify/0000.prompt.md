You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attack pattern as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code does not properly handle the alternating attacks on the first and last ships, nor does it correctly account for the durability reduction and sinking of ships.

Let's analyze the code and provide a counterexample:

1. **Incorrect Attack Simulation**:
   - The code calculates `s_a` and `s_b` as cumulative sums of the first and last `i` ships' durabilities, respectively.
   - It then checks if `s_a <= a` and `s_b <= b` to determine how many ships are sunk.
   - This approach does not correctly simulate the alternating attack pattern (first, last, first, last, ...).

2. **Cumulative Sum Misinterpretation**:
   - The cumulative sums `s_a` and `s_b` are used to determine the number of ships sunk based on the total durability reduction up to a certain point.
   - This does not accurately reflect the Kraken's attack pattern where each attack reduces the durability of a single ship by 1.

3. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the test case:
     ```
     4 5
     1 2 4 3
     ```
   - The expected output is `2` because:
     1. The Kraken attacks the first ship (durability becomes 0), `a = [2, 4, 3]`.
     2. The Kraken attacks the last ship (durability becomes 2), `a = [2, 4, 2]`.
     3. The Kraken attacks the first ship (durability becomes 1), `a = [1, 4, 2]`.
     4. The Kraken attacks the last ship (durability becomes 1), `a = [1, 4, 1]`.
     5. The Kraken attacks the first ship (durability becomes 0), `a = [4, 1]`.
   - The code's approach might not correctly simulate this sequence of attacks and could return an incorrect number of sunk ships.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - A correct approach would involve maintaining a deque or list of ships and alternating between attacking the first and last ship until either all ships have sunk or the specified number of attacks have been made.
   - Each attack should reduce the durability of the attacked ship by 1, and if a ship's durability reaches 0, it should be removed from the list of ships.

Given the above analysis, the provided code does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attack pattern and is therefore incorrect.
