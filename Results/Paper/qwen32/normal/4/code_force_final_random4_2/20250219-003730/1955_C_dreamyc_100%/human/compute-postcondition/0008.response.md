Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `b` is `k // 2`, `ans` is 0, `s_a` is `nums[0]`, `s_b` is 0, `i` is 0**

In this output state, `s_a` has been updated to be equal to the first element of the list `nums`, which is `nums[0]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
