The given code snippet calculates `t2` as `a - t1`. Since `t1` is already defined as `t * 15 - b * 4`, the new value of `t2` is derived from this calculation.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is the first integer from the input.
- `b` is the second integer from the input.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- For each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99.
- `i` is `i + 2`.
- `t` is updated based on certain conditions.
- `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.

After executing `t2 = a - t1`, the value of `t2` changes to `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`.

Output State: **`a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `n` is greater than 0, for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99, `i` is `i + 2`, `t` is updated based on certain conditions, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`**.
