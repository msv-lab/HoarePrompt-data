Postcondition: **`a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `n` is greater than 0, for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99, `i` is `i + 2`, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t` is updated to `t + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + ((a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15) + 1`.**
