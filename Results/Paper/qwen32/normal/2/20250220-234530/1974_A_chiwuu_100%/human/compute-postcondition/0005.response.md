The code snippet assigns the value of `b` to the variable `t`. This means that the new value of `t` will be whatever the value of `b` was before this assignment. The other variables (`a`, `n`, and the test cases `x` and `y`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is equal to `b`; `a` is an integer representing the first integer from the input; `b` is an integer representing the second integer from the input; `n` must be greater than 0; for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99.**
