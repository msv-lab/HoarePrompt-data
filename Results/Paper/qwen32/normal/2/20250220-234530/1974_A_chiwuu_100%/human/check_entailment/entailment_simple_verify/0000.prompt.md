You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

        a = int(a)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness according to the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to determine the minimum number of 5x3 screens required to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons.
- Each screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons or a combination of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, considering the space constraints.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it calculates the number of screens required using a specific formula. Here is the program again for reference:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b
        if t % 2 == 0:
            t = t // 2
        else:
            t = t // 2 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the values of `a` (number of 1x1 icons) and `b` (number of 2x2 icons).

2. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - `t = b`: This initializes `t` with the number of 2x2 icons.
   - `if t % 2 == 0: t = t // 2 else: t = t // 2 + 1`: This calculates the minimum number of screens required to place the 2x2 icons. Since each screen can hold at most one 2x2 icon, this calculation is correct.

3. **Calculating Remaining Space for 1x1 Icons**:
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`: This calculates the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons. Each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, so `b * 4` cells are used. The total available cells are `t * 15`.
   - `if t1 >= a: t = t`: This checks if the remaining space is sufficient to place all 1x1 icons. If yes, no additional screens are needed.
   - `else: t2 = a - t1`: This calculates the number of additional 1x1 icons that need to be placed.
   - `if t2 % 15 == 0: t = t + t2 // 15 else: t = t + t2 // 15 + 1`: This calculates the additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons.

### Testing the Program:
Let's verify the program with some test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**: `x = 1`, `y = 1`
   - One 2x2 icon requires one screen.
   - Remaining space: `15 - 4 = 11` cells.
   - One 1x1 icon fits in the remaining space.
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2**: `x = 7`, `y = 2`
   - Two 2x2 icons require two screens.
   - Remaining space: `30 - 8 = 22` cells.
   - Seven 1x1 icons fit in the remaining space.
   - Expected Output: `1` (Two screens can hold both 2x2 and 1x1 icons).
   - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**: `x = 12`, `y = 4`
   - Four 2x2 icons require four screens.
   - Remaining space: `60 - 16 = 44` cells.
   - Twelve 1x1 icons fit in the remaining space.
   - Expected Output: `2` (Four screens can hold the 2x2 icons, but we need an additional screen for the 1x1 icons).
   - Program Output: `2` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4**: `x = 0`, `y = 3`
   - Three 2x2 icons require two screens.
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Program Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5**: `x = 0`, `y = 0`
   - No icons require zero screens.
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Program Output: `0` (Correct)

6. **Test Case 6**: `x = 8`, `y = 2`
   - Two 2x2 icons require two screens.
   - Remaining space: `30 - 8 = 22` cells.
   - Eight 1x1 icons fit in the remaining space.
   - Expected Output: `1` (Two screens can hold both 2x2 and 1x1 icons).
   - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

7. **Test Case 7**: `x = 15`, `y = 0`
   - Fifteen 1x1 icons require one screen.
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

8. **Test Case 8**: `x = 8`, `y = 2`
   - Two 2x2 icons require two screens.
   - Remaining space: `30 - 8 = 22` cells.
   - Eight 1x1 icons fit in the remaining space.
   - Expected Output: `1` (Two screens can hold both 2x2 and 1x1 icons).
   - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

9. **Test Case 9**: `x = 0`, `y = 9`
   - Nine 2x2 icons require five screens.
   - Expected Output: `5`
   - Program Output: `5` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
After testing multiple scenarios, the program seems to correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required for all given test cases. The logic appears to handle all edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for different combinations of 1x1 and 2x2 icons. It handles edge cases such as no icons, only 1x1 icons, only 2x2 icons, and combinations thereof.
