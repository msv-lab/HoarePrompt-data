Let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

The code snippet is:
```python
t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `t` is updated based on certain conditions.
- `t2` is defined as `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`.

The new value of `t` is calculated as the old value of `t` plus the integer division of `t2` by 15, plus 1.

To find the new value of `t`, we need to substitute `t2` into the equation:
- `t2 = a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`.
- Therefore, `t2 // 15` is `(a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15`.

So the new value of `t` becomes:
- `t = t + ((a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15) + 1`.

This means `t` is updated based on the above formula.

All other variables (`a`, `b`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `i`, `t1`) remain unchanged unless they are explicitly modified in the code snippet, which they are not.

Output State: **`a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `n` is greater than 0, for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99, `i` is `i + 2`, `t` is updated to `t + ((a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15) + 1`, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`**.
