Output State: **`t` is the second integer from the input, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `n` is greater than 0, and for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99. `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simple terms, the value of `t` has been updated to be the same as `b`, which is the second integer from the input. All other variables remain unchanged.
