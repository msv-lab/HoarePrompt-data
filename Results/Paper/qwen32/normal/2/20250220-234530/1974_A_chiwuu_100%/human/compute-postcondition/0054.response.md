To determine the output of the `print(t)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the logic involved in updating the variable `t`.

### Initial State:
- `a` is the first integer from the input.
- `b` is the second integer from the input.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- For each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99.
- `i` is `i + 2` (though `i` is not directly used in the calculation of `t`).
- `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.

### Logic for Updating `t`:
1. Calculate `t1` as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
2. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, `t` remains unchanged.
3. If `t1` is less than `a`:
   - Calculate `t2` as `a - t1`.
   - If `t2` is divisible by 15, increment `t` by `(a - t1) // 15`.
   - If `t2` is not divisible by 15, set `t` to `a // 15 + b * 4 // 15 + 1`.

### Analysis:
Given the initial state, the value of `t` is initially not specified, but it will be updated based on the conditions provided. The final value of `t` depends on the values of `a` and `b`.

Let's consider the steps to determine the final value of `t`:

1. **Initial Calculation**:
   - Calculate `t1` as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - Compare `t1` with `a`.

2. **Update Conditions**:
   - If `t1 >= a`, `t` remains unchanged.
   - If `t1 < a`, calculate `t2` as `a - t1`.
     - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, increment `t` by `t2 // 15`.
     - If `t2 % 15 != 0`, set `t` to `a // 15 + b * 4 // 15 + 1`.

### Final Output:
The final value of `t` after applying the above logic will be printed.

Since the exact initial value of `t` is not provided, we can describe the output in terms of the conditions and calculations described.

Output: **t (where t is updated based on the conditions involving a and b as described above)**
