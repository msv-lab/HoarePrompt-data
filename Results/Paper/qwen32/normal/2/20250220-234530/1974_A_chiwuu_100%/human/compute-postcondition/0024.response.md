The given code snippet only reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. It does not perform any further operations that would affect the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `t1`, `t2`, or `i`.

Here's the updated state:

- `a` and `b` are now assigned the values read from the input.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `t1`, `t2`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `n` is greater than 0, and for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99. `i` is `i + 1`.**
