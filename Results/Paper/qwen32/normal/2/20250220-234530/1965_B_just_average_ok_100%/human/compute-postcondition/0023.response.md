To determine the output of the `print(*nums)` statement, let's break down the problem step-by-step based on the initial state provided:

1. **Initialization of Variables:**
   - `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (This value is not used in the given code snippet, so it can be ignored for this specific print statement).
   - `n`: The first integer from the input.
   - `k`: The second integer from the input.
   - `nums`: A predefined list of powers of 2 up to 1048576.
   - `idx`: The index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` (excluding the newly added elements) that is less than or equal to `k`, or `-1` if `k` is greater than 1048576.

2. **Modification of `nums` List:**
   - The list `nums` initially contains the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\).
   - Additional elements are added to `nums`:
     - `k - nums[idx]` (if `idx` is not -1)
     - `k + 1`
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1` (if `idx` is not -1)
     - `1 << idx` (which is equivalent to `nums[idx]` if `idx` is not -1) is excluded from the list.

3. **Determination of `idx`:**
   - `idx` is determined by finding the largest power of 2 in the initial `nums` list that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - If `k` is greater than 1048576, `idx` is set to -1.

4. **Constructing the Final `nums` List:**
   - If `idx` is not -1, the following elements are added to `nums`:
     - `k - nums[idx]`
     - `k + 1`
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`
   - The element `nums[idx]` is removed from the list.
   - If `idx` is -1, only `k + 1` is added to the list.

Let's illustrate this with an example:

### Example Calculation:
Assume `k = 500`.

- The initial `nums` list is: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`.
- The largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to 500 is 256, which is at index 8.
- Therefore, `idx = 8`.
- The element `nums[idx]` is 256.
- The additional elements to be added are:
  - `k - nums[idx] = 500 - 256 = 244`
  - `k + 1 = 501`
  - `k + nums[idx] + 1 = 500 + 256 + 1 = 757`
- The element `256` is removed from the list.
- The final `nums` list will be: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 244, 501, 757]`.

### General Case:
Given the above steps, the final `nums` list will include all the original powers of 2 up to 1048576, excluding the one closest to `k` (if `k` is within the range), along with the three additional calculated elements.

### Final Output:
The `print(*nums)` statement will print all the elements of the modified `nums` list separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 1048576 [k - nums[idx]] k + 1 [k + nums[idx] + 1] (where [k - nums[idx]] and [k + nums[idx] + 1] are included only if idx is not -1)**

If `k` is greater than 1048576, the final `nums` list will be: **1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 1048576 k + 1**

Output: **1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 1048576 k + 1 (where k is the second integer from the input)**
