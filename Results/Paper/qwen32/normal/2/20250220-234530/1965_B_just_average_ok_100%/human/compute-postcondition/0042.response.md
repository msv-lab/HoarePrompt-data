The code appends the value of `k - nums[idx]` to the list `nums`. Given that `idx` is 20, the value at `nums[20]` is 1048576. Therefore, the new element appended to `nums` is `k - 1048576`.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is the first integer from the input, k is the second integer from the input, nums is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, k - 1048576], idx is 20.**
