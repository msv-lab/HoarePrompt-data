Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `nums` is a predefined list with specific values, including some expressions involving `k`:
  - `nums = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, k - 1048576, k + 1, 2*k - 1048575]`
- `idx` is set to 20, but it is not used in the provided code snippet.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*nums)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(*nums)` statement unpacks the `nums` list and prints each element separated by a space.
- The `nums` list contains 23 elements:
  - The first 20 elements are powers of 2 starting from \(2^0\) up to \(2^{19}\).
  - The 21st element is \(k - 1048576\).
  - The 22nd element is \(k + 1\).
  - The 23rd element is \(2*k - 1048575\).

### Output:
The output will be the elements of the `nums` list printed in order, separated by spaces.

Given the initial state, we know the first 20 elements explicitly, and the last three elements depend on the value of `k`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 [k - 1048576] [k + 1] [2*k - 1048575] (where k is the second integer from the input)**
