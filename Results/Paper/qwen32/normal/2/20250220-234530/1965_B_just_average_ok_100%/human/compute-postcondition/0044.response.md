The given code appends a new element to the list `nums`. The new element is calculated as `k + nums[idx] + 1`. Given that `idx` is 20, the element at index 20 in `nums` is `k - 1048576`. Thus, the new element being appended is `k + (k - 1048576) + 1`, which simplifies to `2*k - 1048575`.

After appending this new element, the list `nums` will have one more element compared to its initial state.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is the first integer from the input, k is the second integer from the input, nums is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, k - 1048576, k + 1, 2*k - 1048575], idx is 20.**
