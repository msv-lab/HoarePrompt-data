The code appends `k + 1` to the list `nums`. This changes the composition of `nums` but does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or `idx`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`], and `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` (excluding the newly added elements) that is less than or equal to `k`, or `-1` if `k` is greater than 1048576.**
