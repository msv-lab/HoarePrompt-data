The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of the `nums` list. Since `nums` is a predefined list with a fixed length of 21, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 21.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was some value (let's call it `i_prev`). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` should now be `i_prev + 1`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize the state by saying that `i` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `i` is `i_prev + 1` where `i_prev` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

However, since we don't know `i_prev`, we can simply say that `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

For clarity, if we assume `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be 4:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `i` is 4**

But generally:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**
