The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the length of `nums`, so we can only adjust those. The loop will execute if the length of `nums` is at least 1. Since `nums` is already defined as a list with 21 elements, its length is 21, which means the loop will definitely execute.

However, according to the instructions, we need to specify the initial state of `i` before the loop starts. Typically, `i` would be initialized to 0 before entering the loop.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect that `i` is 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `idx` is -1, `i` is 0**
