You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

    for _ in range(int(input())):

        idx = -1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
- There should be no subsequence of `a` that sums to `k`.
- For every integer `v` from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`), there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Generating Initial Sequence:**
   ```python
   nums = [1 << i for i in range(21)]
   ```
   This line generates a list of powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\). These values are `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 1048576]`. The purpose of this is to cover a wide range of sums using subsequences.

2. **Finding the Largest Power of 2 Less Than or Equal to `k`:**
   ```python
   idx = -1
   for i in range(len(nums)):
       if nums[i] > k:
           idx = i - 1
           break
   ```
   This loop finds the index of the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`. If `k` is smaller than the smallest power of 2 (which is 1), `idx` will remain -1, but this scenario is not possible since `k >= 1`.

3. **Adjusting the Sequence:**
   ```python
   nums.append(k - nums[idx])
   nums.append(k + 1)
   nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
   nums.remove(1 << idx)
   ```
   - `nums.append(k - nums[idx])`: Adds a number that, when added to the largest power of 2 less than `k`, equals `k`. This ensures that no subsequence can sum to `k`.
   - `nums.append(k + 1)`: Adds `k + 1` to ensure that sums greater than `k` can be achieved.
   - `nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)`: Adds another number to cover additional sums.
   - `nums.remove(1 << idx)`: Removes the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` to avoid creating a subsequence that sums to `k`.

4. **Printing the Result:**
   ```python
   print(len(nums))
   print(*nums)
   ```
   Prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.

### Evaluation:

- **Coverage of Sums:** The initial sequence of powers of 2 allows for the formation of any sum up to \(2^{21} - 1\) using subsequences. By adjusting the sequence, we ensure that sums up to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed.
- **Exclusion of `k`:** The adjustments made (removing a specific power of 2 and adding new numbers) ensure that no subsequence can sum to `k`.

However, there are some potential issues:
- **Handling Edge Cases:** The program does not handle edge cases where `k` is very small or when `n` is much larger than the maximum sum achievable by the initial sequence of powers of 2.
- **Size Constraint:** The sequence might exceed 25 elements in some cases, which violates the problem constraint.

### Conclusion:
The program does not guarantee that the sequence will always be of size at most 25, and it may not handle all edge cases correctly. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to be correct for all possible inputs within the problem constraints.
