The given code snippet reassigns the list `nums` using a list comprehension that generates powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\). This means the new `nums` list will contain the values [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576].

The initial state specified some additional elements in the `nums` list that are not part of this new assignment. However, since the entire `nums` list is reassigned, those elements are no longer part of the list.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `idx`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `idx` is 20.**
