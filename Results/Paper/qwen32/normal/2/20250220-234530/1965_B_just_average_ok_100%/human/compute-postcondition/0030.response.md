The code snippet assigns the value `i - 1` to the variable `idx`. Given that `nums[i]` is greater than `k`, we know that `i` is an index in the list `nums` where the element at that index exceeds `k`. Since `idx` was initially -1, it is now updated to `i - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `idx` is `i - 1`, and `nums[i]` is greater than `k`.**
