The code increments the value of `index` by 1. The other variables (`n`, `p`, `data`, `t`, `results`, and `result`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[2:2+n]`; `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer; `index` is `3 + n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0] - 1`; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the value of `result`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`**.
