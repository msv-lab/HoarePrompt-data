Given the initial state:
- `dp` is a list of zeros with a length of `2 * n + 1`.
- `final_sum` is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
return dp[final_sum]
```

Since `dp` is a list of zeros, every element in `dp` is `0`. Therefore, regardless of the value of `final_sum`, the value at `dp[final_sum]` will always be `0`.

Output State: **The program returns 0**.
