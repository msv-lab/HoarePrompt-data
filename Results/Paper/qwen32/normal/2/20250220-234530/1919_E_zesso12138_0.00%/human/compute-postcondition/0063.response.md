Postcondition: **`dp` is a list of zeros of length `2 * n + 1`, `new_dp` is a list of zeros of length `2 * n + 1` except `new_dp[j + 1]` which is `(dp[j]) % MOD` if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`. Additionally, if `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_dp[j - 1]` is also `(dp[j]) % MOD`. `i` is 2, `n` is at least 0, and if `dp[j]` is greater than 0, the above updates to `new_dp` occur.**
