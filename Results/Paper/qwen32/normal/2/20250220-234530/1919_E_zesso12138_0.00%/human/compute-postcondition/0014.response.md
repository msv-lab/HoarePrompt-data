The code snippet assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to `n`. Given the initial state, `index` is `2 + n`, so the new value of `n` will be the integer value of `data[2 + n]`.

Since `n` is being reassigned, the new value of `n` will be the integer value of `data[2 + n]`. The other variables (`p`, `data`, `index`, `t`, `results`, and `result`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[2:2+n]`; `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer; `index` is `2 + n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0] - 1`; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the value of `result`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`**.
