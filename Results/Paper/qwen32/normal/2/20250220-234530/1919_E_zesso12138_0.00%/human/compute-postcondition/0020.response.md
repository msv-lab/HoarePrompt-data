The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state. However, the loop's continuation depends on the variable `t`. Therefore, we need to adjust `t` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

Given:
- `t` is the integer value of `data[0] - 1`.
- The loop runs `t` times.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` would have been decremented by 1 (since each iteration of the loop reduces `t` by 1). To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `t` should be incremented by 1.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:
- `t` should be incremented by 1 to allow the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer; `index` is `3 + 2*n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`**
