Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Variable `t`**: It is explicitly set to 1.
2. **Variable `index`**: It is calculated using the formula `1 + sum(1 + n_i for i in range(1, t+1))`. Since `t` is 1, this simplifies to `1 + sum(1 + n_i for i in range(1, 2))`, which further simplifies to `1 + (1 + n_1)`. However, the value of `n_1` is not provided, so we can only express `index` in terms of `n_1`: `index = 2 + n_1`.
3. **List `results`**: It contains one element, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration. Since it's the first iteration (`t=1`), there is no previous iteration to refer to for `n` and `p`. Therefore, the value of the single element in `results` is `func_1(n, p)` for the current `n` and `p` in this iteration.
4. **Variables `n` and `p`**: These are mentioned as being used in the last iteration but are not explicitly defined in the initial state. For the first iteration, they would be defined within the context of the loop or function call that sets up `results`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is `print(res)`. However, there is no variable named `res` defined in the initial state. There is a list named `results`, but the print statement refers to `res`, which is not present.

Given the information, it seems there might be a typo in the print statement, and it should likely be `print(results)` instead of `print(res)`. Assuming this correction, let's proceed with `print(results)`.

### Determining the Output:
- Since `results` contains one element, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)` for the current `n` and `p`, the output will be a list with one element.
- The exact value of this element depends on the implementation of `func_1(n, p)` and the values of `n` and `p` in the current iteration.

### Final Output:
Output: **[result_of_func_1(n, p)] (where result_of_func_1(n, p) is the result of the function func_1 called with the respective n and p in the current iteration)**
