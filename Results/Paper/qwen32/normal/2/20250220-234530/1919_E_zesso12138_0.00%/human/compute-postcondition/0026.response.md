Output State: **`n` is `int(data[3 + 2*old_n])`; `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer; `index` is `3 + 2*int(data[3 + 2*old_n]) + 1 + int(data[3 + 2*old_n])`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is a list containing three elements, the first two of which are the value returned by `func_1(old_n, p)`, and the third is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `n`, `p`, `data`, `index`, `t`, and `result` remain unchanged. The only change is that the `results` list now contains three elements instead of two, with the third element being the value of `result`.
