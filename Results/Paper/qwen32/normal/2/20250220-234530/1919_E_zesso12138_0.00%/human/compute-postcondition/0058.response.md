Output State: **`dp` is a list of zeros of length `2 * n + 1`, `new_dp` is a list of zeros of length `2 * n + 1` except `new_dp[j + 1]` which is `(dp[j]) % MOD`, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 0, and `dp[j]` is greater than 0. Additionally, `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to be `(dp[j]) % MOD`. All other variables retain their initial values.
