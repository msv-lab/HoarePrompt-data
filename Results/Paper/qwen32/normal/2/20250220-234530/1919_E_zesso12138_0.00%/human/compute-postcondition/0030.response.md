In this case, the loop iterates over the `results` list. The loop head only contains the variable `res`, which takes on the value of each element in the `results` list during each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is 1
- `index` is `1 + sum(1 + n_i for i in range(1, t+1))`
- `results` is a list containing 1 element, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)` for the respective `n` and `p` in the iteration
- `n` and `p` are the values used in the last iteration

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop progresses. Since the loop iterates over `results`, and `results` currently has only one element, the loop will terminate after this iteration because there are no more elements to iterate over.

However, if we were to hypothetically add another element to `results` to allow the loop to execute one more time, we would need to adjust the `results` list accordingly. But based on the given state, the loop cannot execute one more time because `results` has only one element.

Since the task specifies that we should only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, and the loop head only includes `res`, and since there are no more elements in `results` to assign to `res`, there is no adjustment needed to the loop head variables to allow another iteration.

Therefore, the state remains as it is, with the understanding that the loop will terminate after this iteration.

State: **`t` is 1, `index` is `1 + sum(1 + n_i for i in range(1, t+1))`, `results` is a list containing 1 element, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)` for the respective `n` and `p` in the iteration, `n` and `p` are the values used in the last iteration**
