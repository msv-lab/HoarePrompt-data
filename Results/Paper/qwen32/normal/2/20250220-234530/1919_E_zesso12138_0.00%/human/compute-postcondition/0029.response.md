Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Variable `t`:** It is explicitly set to 1.
2. **Variable `index`:** It is calculated using the formula `1 + sum(1 + n_i for i in range(1, t+1))`. Given that `t` is 1, this simplifies to `1 + sum(1 + n_i for i in range(1, 2))`. Since the range only includes `i = 1`, this further simplifies to `1 + (1 + n_1)`. However, the value of `n_1` is not provided, so we cannot compute an exact numerical value for `index`. For now, let's keep it as `1 + (1 + n_1)`.
3. **List `results`:** It contains one element, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)` for the respective `n` and `p` in the last iteration. Again, the specific values of `n` and `p` are not provided, so we cannot compute the exact value of the element in `results`.

### Code Snippet Analysis:
The code snippet contains a `print(res)` statement. However, there is no variable `res` mentioned in the initial state. This suggests that either there is a typo in the code snippet, or `res` is supposed to be `results` or some other variable that is not provided in the initial state.

Given the context and the available information, it seems likely that the intended variable to be printed is `results`. If this is the case, the output would be the contents of the `results` list.

### Conclusion:
Since `results` contains one element, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)` for the last iteration, and we do not have the specific values of `n` and `p`, we can only describe the output in terms of the function result.

Output: **results (where results is a list containing one element, which is the result of func_1(n, p) for the respective n and p in the last iteration)**

If `res` was indeed meant to be `results`, this is the precise description of what will be printed. If `res` refers to a different variable, more information would be needed to determine the exact output.
