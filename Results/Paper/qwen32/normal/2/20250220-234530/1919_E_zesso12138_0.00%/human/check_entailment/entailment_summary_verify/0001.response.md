### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the function summaries to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to count the number of initial arrays `a` of size `n` consisting of only `1` and `-1` such that when we compute the prefix sums `p` and sort them, we get the given sorted prefix sum array `p`. The result should be given modulo `998,244,353`.

#### Provided Code Analysis:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to count the number of ways to form the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - It initializes a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to reach the prefix sum `i - offset` (where `offset` is set to `n` to handle negative indices).
   - It iterates through each element in the array `p` and updates the DP array based on the possible transitions from the previous state (either adding `1` or `-1`).
   - Finally, it returns the value at the position corresponding to the final sum of `p` adjusted by the offset.

2. **Input Handling (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input, processes each test case, and calls `func_1` to compute the result.
   - It handles multiple test cases and prints the results accordingly.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary for `func_2` incorrectly states that the function computes and prints the hidden array `a`. However, based on the provided code, `func_2` actually computes and prints the number of possible arrays `a` that can produce the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

#### Analysis:

- **Dynamic Programming Implementation**: The implementation of the dynamic programming approach seems correct. The DP array `dp` is initialized with an offset of `n` to handle negative indices, and the transitions correctly account for adding `1` or `-1` to the current prefix sum.
- **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation ensures that the results do not overflow and remain within the required bounds.
- **Testing Against Examples**: The provided examples match the expected behavior of the code:
  - For `n=1` and `p=[0]`, the output is `0` because there is no way to have a prefix sum of `0` with just one element.
  - For `n=1` and `p=[1]`, the output is `1` because the only possible array is `[1]`.
  - For `n=3` and `p=[-1, 1, 2]`, the output is `0` because there is no valid array `a` that can produce this sorted prefix sum array.
  - For `n=5` and `p=[-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`, the output is `3` because there are three valid arrays `a` that can produce this sorted prefix sum array.
  - For `n=5` and `p=[-4, -3, -3, -2, -1]`, the output is `1` because there is only one valid array `a` that can produce this sorted prefix sum array.

#### Challenges to the Original Assessment:
- The function summary for `func_2` is inaccurate. It states that the function computes and prints the hidden array `a`, but it actually computes and prints the number of possible arrays `a`.

Despite the inaccuracy in the function summary, the core functionality of the code is correct. The code correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem and handles the constraints appropriately.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem and handles the constraints appropriately, despite the inaccurate function summary for `func_2`.

**Final: True**
