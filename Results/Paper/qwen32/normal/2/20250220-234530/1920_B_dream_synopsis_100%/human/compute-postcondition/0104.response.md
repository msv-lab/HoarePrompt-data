The given code appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. No other variables are modified directly by this line of code.

Given the initial state, `ans` was already a list containing one element `sums`. After executing `ans.append(sums)`, `ans` will now contain two elements: the original `sums` and the newly appended `sums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`; `ans` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `sums`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `sums` is now `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` if \(i + x - 1 < n\), or `sums + a[i - 1]` if \(i + x - 1 \geq n\).**
