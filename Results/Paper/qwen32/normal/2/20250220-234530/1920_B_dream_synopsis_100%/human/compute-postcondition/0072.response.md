Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is a list that gets updated based on the value of `i` relative to `k` and `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]` from its previous value. All other variables retain their initial values.
