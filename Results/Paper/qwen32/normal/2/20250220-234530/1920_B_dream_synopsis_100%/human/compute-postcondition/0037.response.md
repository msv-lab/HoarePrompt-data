Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that k ≥ 0; `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed (now descending) sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` and, depending on the condition, either the newly appended `sums` or `sums + a[0]`; `i` is `i + 1`. If `i` was initially 0, `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and `ans` includes the newly appended `sums`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` and `ans` includes an additional element which is the current value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1` is not less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]` and `ans` includes an additional element which is the current value of `sums`.**
