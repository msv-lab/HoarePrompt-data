The given code calculates a new variable `sums` based on the existing variables `sum1` and `a`. Specifically, it subtracts twice the sum of the first `x` elements of the list `a` from `sum1`.

Here's the updated state of the variables after the code execution:

- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` remains the first integer from the input.
- `k` remains at least 0.
- `x` remains the third integer from the input.
- `a` remains a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input.
- `sum1` remains the sum of all elements in the original list `a`.
- `ans` remains an empty list.
- `i` remains 0.
- `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
