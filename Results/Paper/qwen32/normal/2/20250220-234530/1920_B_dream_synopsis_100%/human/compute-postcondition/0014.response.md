The code appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. No other variables are modified in the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k` is an integer such that k ≥ 0, `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed (now descending) sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`; `i` is not equal to 0 and the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`; `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
