The given code appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. 

Since `sums` is updated before this line, the new value of `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. The list `ans` initially contains two elements, both equal to the previous value of `sums`. After appending the new value of `sums`, `ans` will now contain three elements: the initial value of `sums`, the initial value of `sums` again, and the newly calculated value of `sums`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`; `ans` is a list containing three elements, the first two being the initial value of `sums` and the third being the updated value of `sums`; `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
