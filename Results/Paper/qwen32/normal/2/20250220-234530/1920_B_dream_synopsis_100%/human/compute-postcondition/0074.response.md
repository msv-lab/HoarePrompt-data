The code snippet adds the element at index `i-1` of the list `a` to the variable `sums`. Given that `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, and `sums` is presumably initialized to some value (which is not specified but would be relevant in a complete context), the new value of `sums` will be its old value plus the element at index `i-1` in `a`.

Since `i` is `i + 1` from the initial state, the element being added to `sums` is the next element in the sequence defined by `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is a list that gets updated based on the value of `i` relative to `k` and `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
