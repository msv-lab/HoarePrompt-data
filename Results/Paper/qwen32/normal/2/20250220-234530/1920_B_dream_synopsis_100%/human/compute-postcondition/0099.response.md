Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`; `ans` is a list containing one element `sums`. If `i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, `sums` is updated based on the condition: if \(i + x - 1 < n\), `sums` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i - 1]` minus `2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, if \(i + x - 1 \geq n\), `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
