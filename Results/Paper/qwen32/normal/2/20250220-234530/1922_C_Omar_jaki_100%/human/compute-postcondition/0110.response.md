To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state and analyze the expression step by step.

### Initial State Recap:
- `a` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`
- `r1` is `2000000000.0`
- `r2` is `2000000000.0`
- `t` is `False`
- `b` is `[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]`
- `u` is `False`
- `c` and `d` are the return values of `r()`
- If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.

### Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

We need to determine the values of `c` and `d` to proceed. Since `c` and `d` are the return values of the function `r()`, we don't have explicit values for them from the initial state. However, we know the relationship between `c` and `d`: either `c < d` or `c >= d`.

Let's consider the possible scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: `c < d`
- Suppose `c = 1` and `d = 2` (these are just example values, but they satisfy `c < d`).
- Calculate `(d - 1) * 2`:
  \[
  (2 - 1) * 2 = 1 * 2 = 2
  \]
- Calculate `(c - 1) * 2`:
  \[
  (1 - 1) * 2 = 0 * 2 = 0
  \]
- Access the elements in list `b`:
  \[
  b[2] = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad b[0] = 0
  \]
- Compute the difference:
  \[
  b[2] - b[0] = 1 - 0 = 1
  \]

#### Scenario 2: `c >= d`
- Suppose `c = 2` and `d = 1` (these are just example values, but they satisfy `c >= d`).
- Calculate `(d - 1) * 2`:
  \[
  (1 - 1) * 2 = 0 * 2 = 0
  \]
- Calculate `(c - 1) * 2`:
  \[
  (2 - 1) * 2 = 1 * 2 = 2
  \]
- Access the elements in list `b`:
  \[
  b[0] = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad b[2] = 1
  \]
- Compute the difference:
  \[
  b[0] - b[2] = 0 - 1 = -1
  \]

### Conclusion:
Given the relationship between `c` and `d`, the output will be either `1` or `-1` depending on whether `c < d` or `c >= d`.

However, since we don't have the exact values of `c` and `d`, we can only describe the output in terms of this relationship.

Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2] (where c and d are the return values of r(), and if c < d, the output is 1; otherwise, it is -1)**
