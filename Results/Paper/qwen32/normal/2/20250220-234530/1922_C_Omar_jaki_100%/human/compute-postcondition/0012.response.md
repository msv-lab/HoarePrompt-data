Let's analyze the given code snippet and its effect on the variables:

Initial State:
- `t` is the number of test cases minus 1
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `a` is a list of `n + 2` integers where -1000000000.0 < a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n < 2000000000.0
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5
- `r` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a tuple of integers
- `b` is [0, 0, v]
- `w` is `a[i+1]`
- `x` is `a[i+2]`
- `y` is `a[i+3]`
- `z` is `a[i+4]`
- `v` is `y - x`

Code Snippet:
```python
b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
```

The code modifies the list `b` by appending two new elements. Let's break down what these elements are:

1. `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)`
   - `b[-2]` refers to the second last element of `b`, which is `0` initially.
   - `v ** (v > x - w)` evaluates to `v ** True` if `v > x - w` (which is `v`) or `v ** False` (which is `1`) otherwise.
   
2. `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`
   - `b[-1]` refers to the last element of `b`, which is `v` initially.
   - `v ** (v > z - y)` evaluates to `v ** True` if `v > z - y` (which is `v`) or `v ** False` (which is `1`) otherwise.

Given that `a` is sorted in ascending order, let's consider the conditions:
- Since `a` is sorted, `x - w` and `z - y` are both positive differences.
- Therefore, `v > x - w` and `v > z - y` are likely to be true unless `v` is very small compared to these differences.

So, the expressions simplify to:
1. `0 + v ** True` which is `0 + v` or simply `v`
2. `v + v ** True` which is `v + v` or `2 * v`

Thus, the new list `b` will be `[0, 0, v, v, 2 * v]`.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n + 2` integers where -1000000000.0 < a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n < 2000000000.0, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `r` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a tuple of integers, `b` is [0, 0, v, v, 2 * v], `w` is `a[i+1]`, `x` is `a[i+2]`, `y` is `a[i+3]`, `z` is `a[i+4]`, `v` is `y - x`.**
