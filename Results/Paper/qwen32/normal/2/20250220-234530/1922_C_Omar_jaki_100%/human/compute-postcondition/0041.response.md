To determine the output state, we need to understand the function `r()` and its effects on the given initial state. However, since the function `r()` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine the exact changes it would make to the variables.

Given the lack of definition for `r()`, we can only assume that `r()` does not alter the variables unless specified otherwise. Since no specific behavior of `r()` is provided, we will assume that it does not change any of the variables in the initial state.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **[0, 0, v1, v1, 2*v1, v1+v2, v1+v2, 2*v1+v2, ..., sum(v1, ..., vk), sum(v1, ..., vk), 2*sum(v1, ..., vk)], u = 0, t is truthy unless it was 1 initially, in which case t = 0.**

This means that all the variables retain their initial values after the execution of `r()`.
