The given Python code snippet initializes a list `b` with two zeros. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, or the lambda function `r`. The only change is the creation of the list `b`.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases minus 1 (an integer between 0 and 10^4); `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n + 2` integers where -1000000000.0 < a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n < 2000000000.0, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and for each of the `m` queries, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ n+2 and x ≠ y; `r` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a tuple of integers; `b` is [0, 0].**
