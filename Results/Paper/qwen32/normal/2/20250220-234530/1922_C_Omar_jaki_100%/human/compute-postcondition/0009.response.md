Let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

Initial State: 
- `t` is the number of test cases minus 1
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `a` is a list of `n + 2` integers where -1000000000.0 < a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n < 2000000000.0
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5
- `r` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a tuple of integers
- `b` is [0, 0]
- `v` is `y - x`

Code Snippet:
```python
b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
```

Impact Analysis:
- The code modifies the list `b` by appending two new elements.
- The first new element is calculated as `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)`.
- The second new element is calculated as `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`.

Given that `b` is initially `[0, 0]`:
- `b[-2]` is `0` (the second last element, which is the first element in this case).
- `b[-1]` is `0` (the last element).

Let's denote the new elements being added as `new_element1` and `new_element2`:
- `new_element1 = b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)`
- `new_element2 = b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`

Since `b[-2]` and `b[-1]` are both `0`, the expressions simplify to:
- `new_element1 = 0 + v ** (v > x - w)`
- `new_element2 = 0 + v ** (v > z - y)`

Thus, the new elements are:
- `new_element1 = v ** (v > x - w)`
- `new_element2 = v ** (v > z - y)`

The expression `v ** (v > x - w)` evaluates to `v ** True` if `v > x - w`, otherwise `v ** False`. Since `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0` in Python, this simplifies to:
- `new_element1 = v` if `v > x - w`, otherwise `new_element1 = 1`

Similarly,
- `new_element2 = v` if `v > z - y`, otherwise `new_element2 = 1`

Therefore, the new state of `b` will be `[0, 0, new_element1, new_element2]`.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n + 2` integers where -1000000000.0 < a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n < 2000000000.0, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `r` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a tuple of integers, `b` is [0, 0, v ** (v > x - w), v ** (v > z - y)], `v` is `y - x`.**
