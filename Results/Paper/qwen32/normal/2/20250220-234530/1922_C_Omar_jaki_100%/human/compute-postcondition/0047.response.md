To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables in the loop head: `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`. These variables are derived from the list `a` using the `zip` function.

Given the loop:
```python
for (w, x, y, z) in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the values were:
- `a` is `[-1000000000.0, r1, r2, 2000000000.0]`
- `v` is `y - x`
- `b` is `[-1000000000.0, r1, r2, 2000000000.0, r2 + v]`

Let's break down the values of `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` at the end of the previous iteration:
- `w` was `a[0]` which is `-1000000000.0`
- `x` was `a[1]` which is `r1`
- `y` was `a[2]` which is `r2`
- `z` was `a[3]` which is `2000000000.0`

For the loop to execute another iteration, `a` must have at least 5 elements because `zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:])` requires `a` to have at least 4 elements to produce a tuple, and for another iteration, it needs one more element.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `w` will be `a[1]` which is `r1`
- `x` will be `a[2]` which is `r2`
- `y` will be `a[3]` which is `2000000000.0`
- `z` will be `a[4]` which is `r2 + v`

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`a` is `[-1000000000.0, r1, r2, 2000000000.0, r2 + v]`; `v` is `y - x`; `b` is `[-1000000000.0, r1, r2, 2000000000.0, r2 + v]`**
