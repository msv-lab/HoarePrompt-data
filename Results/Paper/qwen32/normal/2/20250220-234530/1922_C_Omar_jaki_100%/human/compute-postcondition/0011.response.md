The given code snippet modifies the value of `v` by setting it to the difference between `y` and `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n + 2` integers where -1000000000.0 < a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n < 2000000000.0, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `r` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a tuple of integers, `b` is [0, 0, v], `w` is `a[i+1]`, `x` is `a[i+2]`, `y` is `a[i+3]`, `z` is `a[i+4]`, `v` is `y - x`.**
