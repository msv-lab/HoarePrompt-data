The only variables in the loop head are `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are derived from the `zip` function applied to slices of the list `a`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust these variables based on their assignment in the loop head.

Given the loop:
```python
for (w, x, y, z) in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is a list with at least 5 elements, e.g., `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- `r1` is 2000000000.0.
- `r2` is 2000000000.0.
- `t` is False.
- `b` is `[0, 0]` plus an undefined value resulting from `b[-2] + v`.

In the previous iteration, if `a` was `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, then:
- `w` would be `0` (from `a[0]`)
- `x` would be `1` (from `a[1]`)
- `y` would be `2` (from `a[2]`)
- `z` would be `3` (from `a[3]`)

For the next iteration, the values of `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` should shift as follows:
- `w` should be `1` (from `a[1]`)
- `x` should be `2` (from `a[2]`)
- `y` should be `3` (from `a[3]`)
- `z` should be `4` (from `a[4]`)

The other variables (`r1`, `r2`, `t`, `b`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` is a list with at least 5 elements, e.g., `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`; `r1` is 2000000000.0; `r2` is 2000000000.0; `t` is False; `b` is `[0, 0]` plus an undefined value resulting from `b[-2] + v`; `w` is 1; `x` is 2; `y` is 3; `z` is 4**
