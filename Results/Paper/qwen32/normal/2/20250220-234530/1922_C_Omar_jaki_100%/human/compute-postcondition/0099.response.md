To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state:

### Initial State Recap:
- `a` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`
- `r1` is `2000000000.0`
- `r2` is `2000000000.0`
- `t` is `False`
- `b` is `[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]`
- `u` is `False`
- `c` and `d` are the return values of `r()`. Additionally, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding `c` and `d`:**
   - We know that `c` and `d` are return values from a function `r()` and `c >= d`.
   - Since the exact values of `c` and `d` are not provided, we need to consider the constraints and the list `b`.

2. **List `b`:**
   - `b` is `[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]`.
   - This list has indices from `0` to `7`.

3. **Expression Analysis:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]`.
   - For this to be valid, `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1` must be valid indices of the list `b` (i.e., between `0` and `7`).

4. **Possible Values of `c` and `d`:**
   - Since `c` and `d` are indices derived from the function `r()`, and `c >= d`, let's consider the possible valid values:
     - If `c = 4` and `d = 4`, then `c * 2 - 1 = 7` and `d * 2 - 1 = 7`.
     - If `c = 3` and `d = 3`, then `c * 2 - 1 = 5` and `d * 2 - 1 = 5`.
     - If `c = 2` and `d = 2`, then `c * 2 - 1 = 3` and `d * 2 - 1 = 3`.
     - If `c = 1` and `d = 1`, then `c * 2 - 1 = 1` and `d * 2 - 1 = 1`.
     - If `c = 0` and `d = 0`, then `c * 2 - 1 = -1` (invalid index).

   Given the constraints, the valid pairs `(c, d)` are `(4, 4)`, `(3, 3)`, `(2, 2)`, and `(1, 1)`.

5. **Calculating the Output:**
   - For any valid pair `(c, d)` where `c >= d`, the expression `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]` will always result in `0` because `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1` will point to the same index in the list `b` due to the symmetry in the list `b`.

### Conclusion:
Given the constraints and the nature of the list `b`, the expression `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]` will always evaluate to `0` for any valid pair `(c, d)` where `c >= d`.

Output: **0**
