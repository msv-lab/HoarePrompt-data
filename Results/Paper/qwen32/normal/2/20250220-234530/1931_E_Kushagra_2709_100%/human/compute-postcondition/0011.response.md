To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given loop, we need to consider the loop's control variable `i` and how it changes from the end of one iteration to the start of the next.

Given:
- The loop iterates over the indices of the string `num` in reverse order, starting from `len(num) - 1` down to `0`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k - 1`.

In the next iteration, `i` should be decremented by 1, as per the loop definition `range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1)`.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k - 2`.

The other variables (`num` and `tot`) do not appear in the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{int(num)} \leq 10^9\), `tot` is 2, `i` is `k - 2`**
