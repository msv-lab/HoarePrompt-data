To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in `func_1` correctly determines the winner of the game based on the rules provided.

### Analysis:

1. **Game Rules Recap:**
   - Anna reverses the digits of a chosen number, removing any leading zeros.
   - Sasha concatenates two numbers in any order and replaces them with the concatenated result.
   - The game ends when only one number remains in the list.
   - Sasha wins if the final number is at least \(10^m\); otherwise, Anna wins.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The number of digits in the final number is crucial. If the total number of digits minus the number of trailing zeros (that Anna can remove) is at least \(m+1\), Sasha can potentially create a number that meets the winning condition.
   - Since Sasha goes second and can concatenate numbers, he can strategically combine numbers to maximize the digit count of the final number.

3. **Program Logic:**
   - The program calculates the total number of digits in all numbers (`tot`).
   - It computes the number of trailing zeros for each number using `zerocnts`.
   - It sorts these trailing zero counts in descending order.
   - It subtracts the trailing zeros from every second element in the sorted list (starting from the first). This simulates Anna's optimal strategy of removing trailing zeros from the numbers she chooses.
   - Finally, it checks if the resulting total number of digits (`tot`) is at least \(m+1\). If so, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

4. **Verification:**
   - The logic seems to account for Anna's optimal strategy of removing trailing zeros.
   - By subtracting the trailing zeros from every second element, it effectively models the alternating turns between Anna and Sasha.
   - The condition `tot >= m + 1` correctly reflects the requirement for Sasha to win.

### Conclusion:

The provided program appears to implement the correct logic to determine the winner based on the rules and constraints of the game. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
