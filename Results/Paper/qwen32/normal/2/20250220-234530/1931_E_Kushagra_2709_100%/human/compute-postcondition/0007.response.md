To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to consider the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over the indices of the string `num` in reverse order.

Given:
- The loop iterates from `len(num) - 1` down to `0`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is a string representation of an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{int(num)} \leq 10^9\).
- `tot` is 1.
- The loop breaks if the character at index `i` in `num` is not '0'.

Let's analyze the state at the start of the next iteration:

1. **Variable `i`:** At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value (let's call it `i_end`). Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end - 1`.

2. **Variable `num`:** This variable does not change within the loop head; it remains the same throughout the iterations.

3. **Variable `tot`:** This variable is not part of the loop head and is not modified based on the loop head variables. Therefore, it remains unchanged.

Given these points, let's determine the specific values:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `i_end`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end - 1`.
- Since the loop iterates from `len(num) - 1` down to `0`, if `i_end` was `0`, the loop would have terminated. Hence, `i_end` must have been greater than `0` for another iteration to occur.

Thus, if `i_end` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k - 1`.

State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{int(num)} \leq 10^9\), `tot` is 1, `i` is `k - 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `k`, we express the state in terms of `k`.

Final Answer:
State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{int(num)} \leq 10^9\), `tot` is 1, `i` is `k - 1`**
