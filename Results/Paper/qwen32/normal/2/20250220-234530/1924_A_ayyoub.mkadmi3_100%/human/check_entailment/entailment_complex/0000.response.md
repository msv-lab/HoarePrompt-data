### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the annotated states.

#### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in the given string `s`.
2. If not, we need to provide one such string that does not occur as a subsequence.

#### Analysis of the Provided Code:
- The code reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by the string `s`.
- It then calls the function `func_1(s, k, n)` which processes the string `s` and returns a tuple `(b, s1, s2)`.
- The returned values are used to determine if the output should be "YES" or "NO".
- If the output is "NO", it constructs a string that does not appear as a subsequence and appends it to the output list.

#### Detailed Analysis of `func_1`:
- `func_1` initializes `s1` and `s2` as empty strings and creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- It iterates through each character in `s`:
  - If the character is in `alphabet`, it removes the character from `alphabet` (if `alphabet` has more than one element).
  - If `alphabet` has only one element, it adds the character to `s2` and resets `alphabet` to contain the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
  - It adds the character to `s1`.
- After the loop, it calculates `r` as `len(s1) // k` and returns a tuple `(len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)`.

#### Issues with the Provided Code:
- The logic inside `func_1` does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` can be formed as subsequences in `s`.
- The function's return value does not directly indicate whether all possible strings of length `n` are present as subsequences.
- The construction of the missing string in the "NO" case is incorrect. It simply constructs a string with the smallest possible characters repeated, which might not be a valid counterexample.

#### Correct Approach:
- To solve the problem correctly, we need to check if every possible combination of length `n` from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets appears as a subsequence in `s`.
- This can be done using dynamic programming or a more efficient approach like the Aho-Corasick algorithm for multiple pattern matching.

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
