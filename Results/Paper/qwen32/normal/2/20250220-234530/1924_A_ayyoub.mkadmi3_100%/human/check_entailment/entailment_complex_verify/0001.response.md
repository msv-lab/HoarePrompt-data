### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem requirements and the provided code to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
- **Objective**: Check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English letters occur as subsequences in the string `s`.
- **Output**: Print "YES" if all such strings are subsequences. Otherwise, print "NO" and provide an example of a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence.

#### Provided Code Analysis:

##### Main Loop:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by the string `s`.
2. **Function Call**: It calls `func_1(s, k, n)` to determine if all possible strings of length `n` can be found as subsequences in `s`.
3. **Decision Making**: Based on the result from `func_1`, it either prints "YES" or "NO" followed by a counterexample string if necessary.

##### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**: Initializes `s1` and `s2` as empty strings. Creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English letters.
2. **Iteration**: Iterates through each character `i` in the string `s`:
   - If `i` is in `alphabet`, it removes `i` from `alphabet` (unless `alphabet` has only one element).
   - Adds `i` to `s1`.
   - If `alphabet` becomes empty, it adds `i` to `s2` and resets `alphabet`.
3. **Return Values**: Calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k` and returns a tuple `(len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)`.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Logic of `func_1`**:
   - The function's logic does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` can be subsequences in `s`. It attempts to track occurrences of characters but does not ensure that all combinations of length `n` are checked.
   - The function does not generate all possible strings of length `n` and verify their presence as subsequences in `s`.

2. **Counterexample Generation**:
   - The counterexample generation logic is flawed. It tries to find the first missing character in `s1` and constructs a string based on that, which does not guarantee that the constructed string is a valid counterexample.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
Given the issues identified, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` does not properly check for the presence of all possible subsequences of length `n`, and the counterexample generation logic is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
