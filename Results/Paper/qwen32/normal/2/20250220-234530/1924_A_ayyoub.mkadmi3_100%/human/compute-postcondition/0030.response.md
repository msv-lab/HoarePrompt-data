Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, an integer `k` representing the number of unique characters in `s`, and an integer `n`. It returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the length of `s` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, a substring of `s` starting from index `r * k` to the end, and the last character of `s`.**
