Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 26, `m` is the length of `s` and satisfies 1 <= `m` <= 1000, `s1` is an empty string, `s2` is an empty string, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets except `i`, and `i` is no longer in `alphabet`. The length of `alphabet` is not equal to 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The character `i` has been removed from the set `alphabet`, which now contains the first `k` lowercase English alphabets excluding `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
