#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, and the length of s (denoted as m) satisfies 1 <= m <= 1000.
def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
        
    #State: s1 is the string `s`, s2 is the last character of `s`, and alphabet is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
    r = len(s1) // k
    return len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2
    #The program returns a tuple containing three elements: a boolean indicating if the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end, and the last character of `s1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a string `s` composed of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, checking if its length is at least `n * k`. It returns a tuple with a boolean indicating this condition, a substring of `s` starting from a specific index, and the last character of `s`.
