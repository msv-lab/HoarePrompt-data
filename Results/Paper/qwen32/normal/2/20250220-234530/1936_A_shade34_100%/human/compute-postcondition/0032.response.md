Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is a list containing the value of `i` if `s` was `'='`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list, and `s` is the input string that is not equal to `'<'`.**
