Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is `i` if `s` is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is `[i]` if `s` is `'<'`, includes the previous elements and the new value `i` if `s` is `'='`, otherwise `pans` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `s` is the string input.**
