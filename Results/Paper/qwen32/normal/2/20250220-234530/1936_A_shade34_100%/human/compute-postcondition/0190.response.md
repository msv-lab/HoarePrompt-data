To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, but it does not directly affect the print statement.
- `n` is greater than 0, but it also does not directly affect the print statement.
- `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received prior to this.
- `mak` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or the current value of `i` if `s` was `'<'`.
- `pans` is a list containing the current value of `i` if `s` was `'<'`, or it remains unchanged unless `s` was `'='`, in which case `pans` contains the new value `i`.
- `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.
- `s` is the string input by the user.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

From the description, we can infer:
- `mak` and `mak2` both represent the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received prior to this.
- `i` is the current index, which is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration.

Given the print statement, it will output:
- `'?'` as a literal string.
- `mak` which is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0.
- `mak2` which is the same as `mak` in this context.
- `i` which is the current index.
- `mak2` again, which is the same as `mak`.

Thus, the output will be in the form:
Output: **? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] (where mak and mak2 are the highest index i for which the input was '<', or 0, and i is the current index)**

However, since `mak` and `mak2` are the same, we can simplify the description:
Output: **? [mak] [mak] [i] [mak] (where mak is the highest index i for which the input was '<', or 0, and i is the current index)**

For the sake of precision and clarity:
Output: **? [mak] [mak] [i] [mak] (where mak is the highest index i for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such input was received, and i is the current index)**
