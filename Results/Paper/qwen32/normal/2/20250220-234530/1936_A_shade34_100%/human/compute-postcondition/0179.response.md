Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received prior to this, `mak` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, and `pans` is a list. If `s` is `'<'`, then `mak` is updated to `i` and `pans` is set to `[i]`. If `s` is `'='`, `pans` is set to `[i]`. If `s` is neither `'<'` nor `'='`, `pans` remains an empty list.**
