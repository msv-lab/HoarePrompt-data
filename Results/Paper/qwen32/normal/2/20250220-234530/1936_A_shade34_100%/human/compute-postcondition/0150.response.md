To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This represents the number of test cases or iterations but does not directly affect the current print statement.
- `n` must be greater than 1. This is a constraint on another variable but does not directly affect the current print statement.
- `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received. Since the specific inputs are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `mak2`.
- `mak` is explicitly set to 0.
- `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='`. Again, without specific inputs, we cannot determine the contents of this list.
- `i` is not defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown.

Given these conditions, let's look at the print statement:

```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

- The first argument is a literal string `'?'`.
- The second and third arguments are both `mak`, which is explicitly set to 0.
- The fourth and fifth arguments are both `i`, but since `i` is not defined, its value is unknown. In Python, if a variable is used before it is assigned a value, it would result in a `NameError`. However, since the task specifies the initial state and does not provide further context about the assignment of `i`, we will assume that `i` is intended to be a placeholder or that its value is not critical for this specific print statement based on the given information.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **? 0 0 i i (where i is undefined in the given initial state)**

However, since the task asks for the most precise description possible based on the precondition and `i` is not defined, we can conclude that the exact values of `i` cannot be determined from the given information. Thus, the output will reflect the known values and indicate the undefined nature of `i`.

Final Output: **? 0 0 i i (where i is undefined in the given initial state)**
