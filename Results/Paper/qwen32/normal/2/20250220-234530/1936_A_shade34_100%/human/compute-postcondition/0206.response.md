The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(pans)`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `pans`. If `i` is less than `len(pans) - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (let's call it `i_end`), and `len(pans)` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it `i_end + 1`. Additionally, `len(pans)` must be such that `i_end + 1 < len(pans)`, meaning `len(pans)` must be at least `i_end + 2`.

Given that `mak` is `i` if the input provided is `'>'`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0, and `mak2` is always 0, these values do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head variables.

So, if `i_end` was the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end + 1` and `len(pans)` should be at least `i_end + 2`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i_end`, let's assume it was `i` at the end of the last iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1` and `len(pans)` should be at least `i + 2`.

State: **`mak` is `i` if the input provided is `'>'`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list with at least `i + 2` elements, `i` is `i + 1`**
