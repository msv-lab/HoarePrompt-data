The code snippet `pans.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `pans`. This means that the list `pans` will now include the current value of `i` as its last element.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `pans`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received prior to this, `mak` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or the current value of `i` if `s` was `'<'`, `pans` is a list containing the current value of `i` appended to its previous contents, `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `s` is the string input by the user**.
