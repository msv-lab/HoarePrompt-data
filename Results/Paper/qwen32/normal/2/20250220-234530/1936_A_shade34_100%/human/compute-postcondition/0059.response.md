Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `mak2` is 0, and `pans` is a list containing at least two elements. If the input provided by the user is the string `'>'`, then `mak` is set to `i`; otherwise, `mak` remains unchanged.**
