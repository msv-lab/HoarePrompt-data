The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a conventional way to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. The loop runs for a number of times specified by the user input, which is converted to an integer.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `n` is the integer value provided by the user input
- `mak2` is 0
- `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input was `'='`, and possibly the last index `i` for which the input was `'<'`
- `mak` is the highest index `i` where the user input was `'>'`

Since the loop variable `_` does not affect the state of the program, the only thing that needs to be considered is the number of iterations left. The loop will continue to execute as long as the number of iterations specified by `n` has not been reached yet.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have completed one iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the number of iterations completed so far should be one less than `n`.

Since the loop variable `_` does not influence the state, we do not need to modify it. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, `pans`, `mak`) remain unchanged.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same except for the implicit iteration count which is managed internally by the loop construct.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input was `'='`, and possibly the last index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, and `mak` is the highest index `i` where the user input was `'>'`**
