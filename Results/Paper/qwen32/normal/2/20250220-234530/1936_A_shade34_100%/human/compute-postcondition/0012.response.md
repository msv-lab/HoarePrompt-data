Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is `i`, `i` is incremented by 1**

Natural Language: The value of `mak` is now set to the current value of `i`. The value of `i` is then incremented by 1. All other variables retain their original values.
