The provided code snippet includes a call to `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream. This operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program; it only ensures that any buffered output is written to the console immediately.

Given that none of the variables (`mak`, `mak2`, `pans`) are modified by the `sys.stdout.flush()` call, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mak` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'>'`, or `0` if no input was `'>'`; `mak2` is `0`; `pans` is unchanged.**
