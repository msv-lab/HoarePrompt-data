The given code snippet includes a call to `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any buffered output is written to the standard output immediately. However, this operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

The variables `t`, `n`, `mak`, and `i` are described in the initial state, and their values remain unchanged by the `sys.stdout.flush()` call.

- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` remains greater than 1.
- `mak` remains `i` if the input string was `'<'`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0.
- `i` has already been incremented by 1 before the `sys.stdout.flush()` call, so its value is one more than its previous value.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is `i` if the input string was `'<'`; otherwise, `mak` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1**.
