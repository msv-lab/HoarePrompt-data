The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (let's call it `i_prev`), and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `i_prev + 1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as long as it is greater than the new value of `i`.

Given the provided state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `n` is greater than 0
- `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `i` if `s` is `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists
- `mak2` is equal to `mak`
- `pans` is `[i]` if `s` is `'<'`, or a list containing the value of `i` if `s` was `'='`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list

We only need to adjust `i` for the next iteration. Assuming `i` was `i_prev` at the end of the last iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `i` if `s` is `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is `[i]` if `s` is `'<'`, or a list containing the value of `i` if `s` was `'='`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list, `i` is `i_prev + 1`** 

Since we don't know the exact value of `i_prev`, we can generalize it as:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `i` if `s` is `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is `[i]` if `s` is `'<'`, or a list containing the value of `i` if `s` was `'='`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**
