The code assigns the value of the current index `i` to the variable `mak`. The values of `t`, `n`, `mak2`, and `pans` remain unchanged. Since `mak` is now set to `i`, the new state reflects this change.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 1, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, `mak` is `i`, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='`.**
