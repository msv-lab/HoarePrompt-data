The code snippet assigns the value of `mak` to `mak2`. This means that `mak2` will now hold the same value as `mak`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `n` is the integer input provided by the user
- `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received
- `mak` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received
- `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='`

After executing `mak2 = mak`, the value of `mak2` is updated to be equal to `mak`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the integer input provided by the user, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received (same as `mak`), `mak` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, and `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='`.**
