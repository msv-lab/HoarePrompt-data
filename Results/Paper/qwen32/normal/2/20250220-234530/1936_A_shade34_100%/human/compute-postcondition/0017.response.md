The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. Therefore, the value of `mak` changes from its previous value (which was `i` if the input string was `'<'`; otherwise, `mak` remained 0) to the current value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is `i`, and `i` is `i + 1`.**
