Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is the integer value provided by the user input.
- `mak2` is initialized to 0.
- `pans` is a list containing at least two elements.
- There is a conditional statement based on user input:
  - If the input provided by the user is the string `'>'`, then `mak` is set to `i`.
  - Otherwise, `mak` remains unchanged.
- `i` is set to 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `mak`:**
   - The value of `mak` depends on the user input.
   - If the user inputs `'>'`, `mak` is set to `i`, which is 2.
   - If the user does not input `'>'`, `mak` remains unchanged. Since `mak` is not explicitly initialized in the given information, we assume it retains its default value, which is not specified. However, if we consider the typical behavior in such scenarios, `mak` might be initialized to some default value, but since it's not mentioned, we'll consider the case where it gets set to `i` if the input is `'>'`.

2. **Variable `i`:**
   - `i` is explicitly set to 2.

3. **List `pans`:**
   - `pans` is a list with at least two elements. Let's denote these elements as `pans[0]`, `pans[1]`, `pans[2]`, etc.

### Print Statement:
- The print statement outputs the following:
  - A literal question mark `'?'`.
  - `pans[mak]` twice.
  - `pans[i]` twice.

Given that `i` is 2, and assuming the user input is `'>'` (which sets `mak` to 2):
- `pans[mak]` translates to `pans[2]`.
- `pans[i]` also translates to `pans[2]`.

Thus, the print statement will output:
- `'?'`
- `pans[2]`
- `pans[2]`
- `pans[2]`
- `pans[2]`

### Final Output:
Output: **? pans[2] pans[2] pans[2] pans[2] (where pans[2] is the third element of the list pans)**
