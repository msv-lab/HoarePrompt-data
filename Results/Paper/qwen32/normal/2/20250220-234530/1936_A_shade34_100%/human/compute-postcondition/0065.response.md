The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range defined by `len(pans)`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `len(pans) - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 3. Additionally, `len(pans)` must be at least 4 to allow the loop to continue executing with `i` being 3 (since the range is exclusive of the upper bound).

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing at least four elements, `mak` remains unchanged unless the user input is '>', in which case `mak` is set to 2, and `i` is 3**
