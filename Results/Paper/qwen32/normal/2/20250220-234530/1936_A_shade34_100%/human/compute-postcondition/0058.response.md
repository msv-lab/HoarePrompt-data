The provided code snippet assigns the value of `i` to the variable `mak`. However, there is no definition or assignment of `i` in the initial state or the provided code snippet. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific value of `i`. Given this, we can only express that `mak` will take on whatever value `i` holds.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `mak` is `i`, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing at least two elements. The input provided by the user is the string `'>'`.**
