The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. The variable `n` does not change within the loop head.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `n` is an integer greater than 1
- `mak2` is 0
- `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input was `'='`, and possibly the last index `i` for which the input was `'<'`
- If the input was `'<'`, `mak` is set to `i`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0
- `i` is `i + 1`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, and `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input was `'='`, and possibly the last index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, `mak` is set to `i` if the input was `'<'`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0, `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**
