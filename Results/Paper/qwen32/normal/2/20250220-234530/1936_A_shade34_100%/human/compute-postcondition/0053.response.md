The code snippet sets `mak` to 0. This changes the value of `mak` from its previous value (which could be any integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) or the last index `i` for which the input was `'<'`) to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `mak2`, and `pans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is equal to the previous value of `mak`, and `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input was `'='`, and possibly the last index `i` for which the input was `'<'`.**
