To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop progresses and modifies the variables based on the input.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`.
- For each iteration, it prints a query and checks the input.
- If the input is `'<'`, it updates `mak` to the current value of `i`.
- The variable `mak` retains its previous value if the input is not `'<'`.
- The loop increments `i` automatically with each iteration.

### Final Output State:
After the loop completes all iterations (from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`):
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as it defines the loop's range.
- The variable `mak` will hold the largest value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`. If no input was `'<'`, `mak` remains `0`.

### Conclusion:
The final state of the variables is:
- `t` is still an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is the same integer value provided by the user input.
- `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, and `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists.**
