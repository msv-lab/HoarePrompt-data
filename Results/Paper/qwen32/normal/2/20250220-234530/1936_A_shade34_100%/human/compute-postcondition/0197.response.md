Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received prior to this, `mak` is the current value of `i` if `s` was `'<'`, otherwise it remains the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, `pans` is a list containing the current value of `i` if `s` was `'<'`, or the current value of `i` appended to its previous contents if `s` was `'='`, otherwise `pans` remains unchanged, `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `s` is the string input by the user.**
