The code snippet provided is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This command flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the console immediately. However, it does not affect any of the variables in the program.

Therefore, none of the variables `t`, `n`, `mak2`, `mak`, `pans`, or `i` are modified by this command.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, `mak` is `i` if the input was `'<'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='`, `i` is 4**.
