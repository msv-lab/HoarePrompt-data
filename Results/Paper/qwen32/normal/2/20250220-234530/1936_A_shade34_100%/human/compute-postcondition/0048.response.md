The code snippet creates a list named `pans` and assigns it the value `[i]`. This means `pans` now contains a single element, which is the current value of `i`.

The values of `i`, `n`, `s`, and `mak` remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the string input by the user, `mak` is equal to `i`, `pans` is a list containing the value of `i`.**
