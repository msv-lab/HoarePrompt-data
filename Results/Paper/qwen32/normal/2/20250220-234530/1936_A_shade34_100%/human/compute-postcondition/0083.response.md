To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t`: An integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `n`: An integer greater than 1.
- `mak2`: Initialized to 0.
- `pans`: A list that contains indices `i` where the input was `'='`, and possibly the last index `i` where the input was `'<'`.
- `mak`: Set to `i` if the current input is `'<'`; otherwise, it remains 0.
- `i`: Incremented by 1 after processing each input.

### Key Points:
- The `print` statement is `print('?', mak, mak, i, i)`.
- `mak` is either 0 or the last index `i` where the input was `'<'`.
- `i` is the current index being processed.

### Analysis:
Given the `print` statement, we need to understand the values of `mak` and `i` at the point of execution.

1. **Value of `mak`**:
   - If the current input was `'<'`, `mak` is set to the current index `i`.
   - If the current input was not `'<'`, `mak` remains 0.

2. **Value of `i`**:
   - `i` is the current index being processed. It starts from some initial value and increments by 1 with each iteration.

### Output Description:
The `print` statement will output the following:
- The literal character `?`.
- The value of `mak`, which is either 0 or the last index `i` where the input was `'<'`.
- The value of `mak` again.
- The value of `i`, which is the current index.
- The value of `i` again.

Since the exact value of `mak` and `i` depends on the specific inputs processed up to this point, we cannot provide a numerical value without knowing the sequence of inputs. However, we can describe the output precisely in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [mak] [mak] [i] [i] (where [mak] is either 0 or the last index i where the input was '<', and [i] is the current index)**
