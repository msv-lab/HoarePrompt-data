The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was some value (let's call it `i_prev`) such that `i_prev < n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Given that the loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`, if `i_prev` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i_prev` from the provided state, we can generalize that at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, if `i` was `i_prev` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can assume that `i` has just finished an iteration and is about to start the next one. Thus, if `i` was `i_prev` previously, it will now be `i_prev + 1`.

However, since we need to provide a general state, we can say that `i` is incremented by 1 from whatever its value was at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. If `s[i]` is 'L', `b` is a list containing the first element of `a`, `l` is 1, and `r` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `b` is a list containing the last element of `a`, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 2`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.** 

To be more specific, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` is `x + 1`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can represent the state as:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. If `s[i]` is 'L', `b` is a list containing the first element of `a`, `l` is 1, and `r` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `b` is a list containing the last element of `a`, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 2`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**

For simplicity, if we assume `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. If `s[i]` is 'L', `b` is a list containing the first element of `a`, `l` is 1, and `r` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `b` is a list containing the last element of `a`, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 2`. `i` is x + 1.**

Since we don't have the exact value of `x`, we can generalize it as:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. If `s[i]` is 'L', `b` is a list containing the first element of `a`, `l` is 1, and `r` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `b` is a list containing the last element of `a`, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 2`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**

Thus, the final state can be represented as:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. If `s[i]` is 'L', `b` is a list containing the first element of `a`, `l` is 1, and `r` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `b` is a list containing the last element of `a`, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 2`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**

Simplifying, we get:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. If `s[i]` is 'L', `b` is a list containing the first element of `a`, `l` is 1, and `r` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `b` is a list containing the last element of `a`, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 2`. `i` is incremented by 1.**

Since we need to provide a specific state, let's assume `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` is `x + 1`. If we assume `i` was `0` at the start of the first iteration, then at the start of the second iteration, `i` would be `1`.

So, if we assume `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` is `x + 1`.

Thus, the state can be represented as:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. If `s[i]` is 'L', `b` is a list containing the first element of `a`, `l` is 1, and `r` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `b` is a list containing the last element of `a`, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 2`. `i` is 1.**

This assumes that `i` was `0` at the end of the previous iteration, and thus `i` is now `1` at the start of the next iteration.

So the final answer is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. If `s[i]` is 'L', `b` is a list containing the first element of `a`, `l` is 1, and `r` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `b` is a list containing the last element of `a`, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 2`. `i` is 1.**
