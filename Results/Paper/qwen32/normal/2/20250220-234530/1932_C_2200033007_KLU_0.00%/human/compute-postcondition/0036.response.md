Output State: **The program returns the list `ans` in reverse order, which contains the cumulative products of the elements of `b` in reverse order.**

To break it down in simple terms: The program calculates cumulative products of the elements in list `b` and stores them in list `ans`. Since the problem specifies that `ans` already contains these cumulative products in reverse order, the function simply returns `ans` as it is.
