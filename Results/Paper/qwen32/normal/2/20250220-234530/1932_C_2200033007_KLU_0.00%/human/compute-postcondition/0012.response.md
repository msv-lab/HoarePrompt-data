The given code appends the element at index `l` of the list `a` to the list `b`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
- If `s[i]` is 'L', `b` is a list containing the first element of `a`, `l` is 1, and `r` is `n - 1`.
- Otherwise, `b` is a list containing the last element of `a`, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 2`.
- `i` is 1.

The line `b.append(a[l])` modifies the list `b` by appending the element at index `l` from the list `a`.

If `s[i]` is 'L':
- Initially, `b` contains the first element of `a`, i.e., `b = [a[0]]`.
- After executing `b.append(a[l])`, `b` becomes `[a[0], a[1]]` because `l` is 1.

If `s[i]` is 'R':
- Initially, `b` contains the last element of `a`, i.e., `b = [a[n-1]]`.
- After executing `b.append(a[l])`, `b` becomes `[a[n-1], a[0]]` because `l` is 0.

Thus, the output state depends on whether `s[i]` is 'L' or 'R':

- If `s[i]` is 'L', `b` becomes `[a[0], a[1]]`.
- If `s[i]` is 'R', `b` becomes `[a[n-1], a[0]]`.

Other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `l`, `r`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. If `s[i]` is 'L', `b` is `[a[0], a[1]]`, `l` is 1, and `r` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `b` is `[a[n-1], a[0]]`, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 2`. `i` is 1.**
