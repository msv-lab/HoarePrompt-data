The given code snippet sets the variable `day` to 'AM'. This assignment does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `s`, `n`, `h`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `day` is 'AM', `n` is greater than 0, `h` is 12, `m` is the minute part of the input time.**
