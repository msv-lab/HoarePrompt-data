### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to ensure it correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `n` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string in the format "hh:mm".

2. **Conversion Logic:**
   - The program splits the input string into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`).
   - It initializes `day` as 'AM'.
   - It checks the value of `h` (hours):
     - If `h` is 0, it sets `h` to 12 and keeps `day` as 'AM' (midnight).
     - If `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM'.
     - Otherwise, it keeps `day` as 'AM'. However, if `h` is exactly 12, it sets `day` to 'PM' (noon).

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the converted time in the format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM", ensuring that `hh` and `mm` are zero-padded to two digits.

### Analysis of Edge Cases:
- **Midnight (00:00):** The program correctly converts this to "12:00 AM".
- **Noon (12:00):** The program correctly converts this to "12:00 PM".
- **Times between 1:00 AM and 11:59 AM:** These are correctly converted with 'AM'.
- **Times between 1:00 PM and 11:59 PM:** These are correctly converted with 'PM'.

### Conclusion:
The program handles all the necessary cases correctly according to the problem description. There are no logical errors in the conversion logic, and the output format matches the requirements.

### Your Response:
Correctness: **True**
