Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` is greater than 0, `h` is 12, `m` is the new minute value read from the input.**

Explanation: The value of `h` has been explicitly set to 12. All other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, and `m`) retain their initial values or states as described in the initial conditions.
