The value of `h` is reduced by 12. Given that `h` was initially greater than 12, after the operation, `h` will be a value between 1 and 12. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is the hour part of the input time minus 12, `m` is the minute part of the input time, `h` is not equal to 0 and is now between 1 and 12**.
