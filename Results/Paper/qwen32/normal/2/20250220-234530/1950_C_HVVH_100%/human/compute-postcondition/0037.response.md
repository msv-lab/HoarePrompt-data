The given code snippet only assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `day`. None of the other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `h`, `m`) are modified by this assignment.

Therefore, the output state remains the same for `t`, `s`, `n`, `h`, and `m`, except that `day` is now `'AM'`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` is greater than 0, `h` and `m` are the new hour and minute values read from the input, `day` is `'AM'`**.
