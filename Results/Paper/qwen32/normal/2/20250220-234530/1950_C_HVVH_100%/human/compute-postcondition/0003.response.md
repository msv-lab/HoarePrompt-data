The code snippet reads a string input in the format "HH:MM", splits it into two parts, converts them to integers, and assigns them to the variables `h` (hours) and `m` (minutes). The variables `t`, `s`, `day`, and `n` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is the hour part of the input time, `m` is the minute part of the input time.**
