Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `day` is 'PM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is the hour part of the input time and is currently 12, `m` is the minute part of the input time, and `h` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `h` is less than or equal to 12.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that the variable `day` has been updated from 'AM' to 'PM'. All other variables retain their initial values and constraints.
