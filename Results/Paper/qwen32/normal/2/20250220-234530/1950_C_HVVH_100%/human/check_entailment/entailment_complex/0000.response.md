### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided program to ensure it correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` of length 5 in the format "hh:mm".

2. **Converting Time:**
   - The program splits the string `s` into `h` (hour) and `m` (minute).
   - It initializes `day` as 'AM'.
   - Depending on the value of `h`, it adjusts `h` and sets `day` appropriately:
     - If `h` is 0, it sets `h` to 12 and keeps `day` as 'AM'.
     - If `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM'.
     - Otherwise, it sets `day` to 'AM'. If `h` is 12, it sets `day` to 'PM'.

3. **Printing Output:**
   - The program prints the adjusted `h` and `m` in the format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM".

### Checking Edge Cases:

- **Midnight (00:00):**
  - `h` is 0, so it is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'.
  - Output: "12:00 AM" (correct).

- **Noon (12:00):**
  - `h` is 12, so `day` is set to 'PM'.
  - Output: "12:00 PM" (correct).

- **Afternoon (13:00 to 23:59):**
  - `h` is greater than 12, so `h` is adjusted by subtracting 12 and `day` is set to 'PM'.
  - Example: 18:06 -> 6:06 PM (correct).

- **Morning (01:00 to 11:59):**
  - `h` is less than or equal to 11, so `day` remains 'AM'.
  - Example: 09:41 -> 09:41 AM (correct).

### Conclusion:

The program handles all edge cases correctly and follows the rules for converting 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
