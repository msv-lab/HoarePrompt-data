In the given task, the for loop iterates exactly 2 times as specified by the range(2) in the loop head. The variables in the loop head are `_` (which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use) and the range function's argument, which is the integer 2.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the range function's argument, which is already fixed at 2. This means the loop will always execute twice regardless of the other variables (`t`, `n`, the binary strings, and the list `a`). However, since the task specifies that we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, and there are no variables in the loop head other than the implicit loop variable `_` and the constant range value 2, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged with respect to the loop's execution condition.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is the input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; the first and second lines of each test case contain binary strings of length `n`; `a` is an empty list**
