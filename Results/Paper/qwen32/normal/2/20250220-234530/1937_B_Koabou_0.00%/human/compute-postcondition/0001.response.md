The code snippet reads an integer `n` from the input. This affects the variable `n` by assigning it the value of the input, which is an integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\). The other variables (`t`, the binary strings, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is the input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; the first and second lines of each test case contain binary strings of length `n`; `a` is an empty list.**
