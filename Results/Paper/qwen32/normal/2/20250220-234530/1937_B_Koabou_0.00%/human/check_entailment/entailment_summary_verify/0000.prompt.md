You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

def func_1():

    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):

            x = i

    else:
        s = a[0] + a[1][n - 1]
        x = n - 1
    t = 1
    for i in range(x):
        if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
    print(s, sep='')
    print(t)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads two binary strings of equal length `n` and constructs a new string `s` based on specific conditions involving the characters of these strings. It then prints the constructed string `s` followed by the value `1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all possible cases for finding the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Logic for Finding the Smallest String**:
   - The program attempts to construct the smallest string by looking for the first occurrence where the bottom row has a '0' and the top row has a '1'. However, this approach does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest string.
   - For example, consider the following input:
     ```
     1
     4
     1101
     1001
     ```
     The program will construct the string `1101` by moving down at the second column because `a[1][1] == '0'` and `a[0][1] == '1'`. However, the lexicographically smallest string is actually `1001`, which can be achieved by moving down at the first column and then right.

2. **Counting the Number of Paths**:
   - The logic for counting the number of paths that yield the smallest string is also flawed. The program assumes that the number of paths is determined by the position where the switch from the top row to the bottom row occurs. This assumption is incorrect.
   - For example, consider the following input:
     ```
     1
     4
     0000
     0000
     ```
     The program will output `0000` as the smallest string, but it incorrectly calculates the number of paths as `1` instead of `5` (since there are multiple ways to traverse the grid to get the same string).

To correctly solve the problem, a more systematic approach is needed, such as using dynamic programming to keep track of the lexicographically smallest string and the number of ways to achieve it at each step.

Here's a corrected version of the program for reference:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = [input().strip() for _ in range(2)]
    
    # dp[i][j][0] -> min string, dp[i][j][1] -> count of paths
    dp = [[['', 0] for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(2)]
    
    dp[0][0] = [a[0][0], 1]
    
    for j in range(1, n):
        if dp[0][j-1][0] + a[0][j] < dp[1][j-1][0] + a[0][j]:
            dp[0][j] = [dp[0][j-1][0] + a[0][j], dp[0][j-1][1]]
        elif dp[0][j-1][0] + a[0][j] > dp[1][j-1][0] + a[0][j]:
            dp[0][j] = [dp[1][j-1][0] + a[0][j], dp[1][j-1][1]]
        else:
            dp[0][j] = [dp[0][j-1][0] + a[0][j], dp[0][j-1][1] + dp[1][j-1][1]]
        
        if dp[0][j-1][0] + a[1][j] < dp[1][j-1][0] + a[1][j]:
            dp[1][j] = [dp[0][j-1][0] + a[1][j], dp[0][j-1][1]]
        elif dp[0][j-1][0] + a[1][j] > dp[1][j-1][0] + a[1][j]:
            dp[1][j] = [dp[1][j-1][0] + a[1][j], dp[1][j-1][1]]
        else:
            dp[1][j] = [dp[0][j-1][0] + a[1][j], dp[0][j-1][1] + dp[1][j-1][1]]
        
        if dp[0][j][0] > dp[1][j][0]:
            dp[0][j] = dp[1][j]
        elif dp[0][j][0] == dp[1][j][0]:
            dp[0][j] = [dp[0][j][0], dp[0][j][1] + dp[1][j][1]]
    
    print(dp[0][-1][0])
    print(dp[0][-1][1])
```

This corrected version uses dynamic programming to ensure that both the smallest string and the number of paths yielding that string are computed correctly for all possible inputs.
