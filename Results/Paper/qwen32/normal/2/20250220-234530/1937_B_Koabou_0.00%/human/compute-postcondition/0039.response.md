Output State: **`s` is `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]` if `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` for some `i`; otherwise, `s` is `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]`. `x` is `i` if `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` for some `i` and `i >= 1`; otherwise, `x` is `n - 1`. `i` is `i + 1`. `t` is `x - i + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to `x - i + 1`. The values of `s`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
