Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Analysis:
- **Variable `s`**: 
  - It is constructed based on a condition involving two strings `a[0]` and `a[1]` and an index `i`.
  - If there exists an index `i` such that `a[0][i + 1] == '1'` and `a[1][i] == '0'`, then `s` is set to `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]`.
  - Otherwise, `s` is set to `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]`.

- **Variable `x`**:
  - It is set to the index `i` if the same condition (`a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'`) holds true and `i >= 1`.
  - Otherwise, `x` is set to `n - 1`.

- **Variable `t`**:
  - It is explicitly set to `1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(t)
```

### Determining the Output:
- The `print` statement only involves the variable `t`.
- According to the initial state, `t` is explicitly set to `1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the value of `t`, which is `1`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **1**
