The given code snippet initializes an empty list `a`. This operation does not affect the values of `t` or `n`, nor does it modify the binary strings provided in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; the first and second lines of each test case contain binary strings of length `n`; `a` is an empty list.**
