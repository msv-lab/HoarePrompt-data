Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is the input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; the first line of each test case contains a binary string of length `n`; the second line of each test case contains another binary string of length `n`; `a` is a list containing two binary strings; `s` is an empty list; `x` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
        s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
        x = i
        break
else:
    s = a[0] + a[1][n - 1]
    x = n - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list containing two binary strings; if `a[0][i + 1] == '1'` and `a[1][i] == '0'`, then `s` is `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]` and `x` is `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, `s` remains an empty list and `x` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list containing two binary strings; if `a[0][i + 1] == '1'` and `a[1][i] == '0'`, then `s` is `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]` and `x` is the value of the incremented `i`; otherwise, `s` remains an empty list and `x` remains 0; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list containing two binary strings; `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[0][i + 1] == '1'` and `a[1][i] == '0'`, then `s` is set to `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]` and `x` is set to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no additional changes are made to `s` or `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
