The code snippet updates the value of `rem` to `k % (i + 1)`. This means `rem` now holds the remainder when `k` is divided by `i + 1`.

Other variables remain unchanged:
- `ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `k` is either 0 (if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`) or reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` (otherwise).
- `a` remains a sorted list of integers.
- `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`.
- `y` is `n - 1 - i` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, otherwise `y` is 0.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Output State: **`ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is either 0 (if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`) or reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` (otherwise); `a` remains a sorted list of integers; `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`; `y` is `n - 1 - i` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, otherwise `y` is 0; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
