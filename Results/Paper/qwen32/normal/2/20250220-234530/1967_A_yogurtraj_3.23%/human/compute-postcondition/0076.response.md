The values of the variables do not change due to the `break` statement, which only exits the loop or block it is in without altering the values of any variables. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers; `n` is an input integer greater than 0; `k` is 0; `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`; `y` is `n - 1 - i`; `ii` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `ii` at the end of the previous iteration; `i` is `i + 2`.**
