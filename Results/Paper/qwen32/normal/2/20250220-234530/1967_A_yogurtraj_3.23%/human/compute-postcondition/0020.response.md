The code assigns the value of `k % (i + 1)` to the variable `rem`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `i` is incremented by 1; `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`**
