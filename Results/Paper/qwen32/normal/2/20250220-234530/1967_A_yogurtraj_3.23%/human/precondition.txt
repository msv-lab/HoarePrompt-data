t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. Each test case in test_cases is a tuple where the first element is a tuple (n, k) with 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12, and the second element is a list a of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^12. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^5.
