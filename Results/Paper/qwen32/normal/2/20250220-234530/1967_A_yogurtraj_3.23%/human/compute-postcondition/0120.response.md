The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from its previous value. The values of `ii`, `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged according to the given conditions.

Output State: **`ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` is greater than 0; `a` remains a sorted list of integers; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.**
