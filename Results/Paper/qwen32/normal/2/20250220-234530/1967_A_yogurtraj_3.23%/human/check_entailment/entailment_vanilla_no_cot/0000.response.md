Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum score according to the problem statement. Let's analyze why:

1. **Logic Error**: The program attempts to distribute the `k` additional cards to make the counts of all card types as equal as possible. However, it does not ensure that after distributing the cards, the resulting sequence can actually form the maximum number of permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The formula `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y` is not correct for calculating the maximum score. The score is determined by how many contiguous subarrays of length `n` are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This requires a different approach, such as using a sliding window technique to count valid permutations after distributing the cards.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program might not handle edge cases correctly, such as when `k` is very large compared to the initial counts of cards, or when `n` is small.

To solve this problem correctly, a more appropriate strategy would involve:
- Calculating the minimum number of cards needed to form a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
- Distributing the `k` additional cards to minimize the difference between the maximum and minimum counts of any card type.
- Using a sliding window or similar technique to count the number of valid permutations in the resulting sequence.

Given these issues, the provided program is incorrect.
