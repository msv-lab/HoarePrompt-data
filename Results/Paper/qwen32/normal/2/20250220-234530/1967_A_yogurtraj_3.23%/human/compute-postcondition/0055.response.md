The code snippet `y = n - 1 - i` updates the value of `y`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the only variable affected by this line is `y`. Since `n` and `i` are provided and `i` is part of the loop condition, we can express the new value of `y` directly in terms of `n` and `i`.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `k` is an input integer; `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`; `y` is `n - 1 - i`; `ii` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `ii` at the end of the previous iteration; `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`.**
