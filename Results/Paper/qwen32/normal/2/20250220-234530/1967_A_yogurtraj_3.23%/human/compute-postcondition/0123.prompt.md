Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `r` is the smallest integer in the list `a`; `rem` is 0; `y` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n - 1):
    if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
        r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
        rem = k % (i + 1)
        y = n - 1 - i
        k = 0
        break
    else:
        k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
        r = a[i + 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is either 0 (if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`) or reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` (otherwise); `a` remains a sorted list of integers; `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, otherwise `r` is `a[i + 1]`; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, otherwise `rem` is 0; `y` is `n - 1 - i` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, otherwise `y` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` is greater than 0; `a` remains a sorted list of integers; `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, otherwise `r` is `a[i + 1]`; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, otherwise `rem` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) % (i + 1)`; `y` is `n - 1 - i` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, otherwise `y` is 0; `k` is 0 if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, otherwise `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` is greater than 0; `a` remains a sorted list of integers; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `r` is assigned the value `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is assigned the value `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is assigned the value `n - 1 - i`, and `k` is set to 0, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` and `r` is assigned the value `a[i + 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
