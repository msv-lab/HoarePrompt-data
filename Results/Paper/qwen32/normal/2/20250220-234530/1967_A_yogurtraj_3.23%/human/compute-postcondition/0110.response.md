Output State: **`ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is 0; `a` remains a sorted list of integers; `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`; `y` is `n - 1 - i`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables do not change due to the `break` statement, but it indicates that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
