The code snippet assigns a new value to `r`. Specifically, it sets `r` to `a[n - 1] + k // n`. This means that the value of `r` changes, while all other variables retain their previous states unless they were dependent on `r`.

Given the initial state, `r` could have had different values depending on whether the loop broke early or completed. However, after executing the given line of code, `r` is explicitly set to `a[n - 1] + k // n`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` and `a` remain unchanged; `k` is non-zero and either remains unchanged or has been reduced by the sum of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `n - 2`; `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)` if the loop broke due to `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, otherwise `rem` is 0; `y` is `n - 1 - i` if the loop broke due to `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, otherwise `y` is 0.**
