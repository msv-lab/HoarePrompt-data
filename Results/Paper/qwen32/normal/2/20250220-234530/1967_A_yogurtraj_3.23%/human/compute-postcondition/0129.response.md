Postcondition: **`ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` and `a` remain unchanged; `k` is either 0 or has been reduced by the sum of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `n - 2`; `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n` if `k` was non-zero and the loop broke due to `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, otherwise `r` is `a[n - 1]`; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)` if the loop broke due to `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, otherwise `rem` is 0; `y` is `n - 1 - i` if the loop broke due to `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, otherwise `y` is 0.**
