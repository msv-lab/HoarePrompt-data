The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust the value of `i` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100;
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2;
- `a` is a sorted list of integers;
- `i` is incremented by 1.

From the loop statement `for i in range(0, n - 1):`, we know that `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n - 1`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 again.

Therefore, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `i` is incremented by 1 (so if it was x, now it is x + 1)**

To put it precisely, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be 4. Thus, generally:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `i` is `i + 1`**
