The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The variables `ii`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
