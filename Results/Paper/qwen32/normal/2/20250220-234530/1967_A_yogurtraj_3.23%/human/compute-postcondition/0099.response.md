Output State: **`ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`; `y` is `n - 1 - i`; `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is set to 0. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
