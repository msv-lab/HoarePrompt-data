To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the context:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³. This indicates the number of test cases, but it does not affect the calculation of `ans` directly in this single print statement.
- `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10⁸ and 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
- `ans` is defined as the largest value of either `i` or `x // i` that satisfies certain conditions for all divisors `i` of `x` up to `isqrt(x)`. Here, `isqrt(x)` refers to the integer square root of `x`, which is the largest integer `k` such that `k * k <= x`.

Given this, `ans` is essentially the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `isqrt(x)` or the corresponding quotient `x // i` for some divisor `i` up to `isqrt(x)`.

However, without the specific values of `x` and `n`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. Nonetheless, we can describe the value of `ans` precisely based on the given information.

The value of `ans` is the maximum value between `i` and `x // i` for all divisors `i` of `x` up to `isqrt(x)`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the largest value of i or x // i for all divisors i of x up to isqrt(x))**
