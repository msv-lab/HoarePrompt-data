Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32; `ac` is 1 if the next character `i` is 'A', otherwise `ac` is 0; `bc` is 1 if the next character `i` is not 'A', otherwise `bc` is 0, and `bc` is now `bc + 1`; `s` is a string input by the user that must have at least one character; `i` is the next character in the string `s`.**

Natural Language: The value of `bc` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
