Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32; `ac` is 0; `bc` is 1; `s` is a string input by the user that must have at least one character; the variable `i` is not equal to 'A'**

Explanation: The value of `bc` is incremented by 1, so `bc` changes from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
