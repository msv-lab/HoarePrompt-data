The value of `v` is updated to the value returned by `func_2()`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are the values returned by `func_3()` and satisfy the conditions \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, which are positive integers satisfying \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\); `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`**.
