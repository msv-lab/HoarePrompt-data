The code snippet `cnt -= 1` decrements the value of `cnt` by 1. Given the initial state, `cnt` is initially equal to `k`. After decrementing, `cnt` will be `k - 1`.

The other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `v`, and `l`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least `k`, `k` must be non-zero, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`**.
