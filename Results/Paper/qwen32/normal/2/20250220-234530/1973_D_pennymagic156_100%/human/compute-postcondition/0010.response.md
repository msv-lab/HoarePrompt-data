Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `n` and `k` are positive integers with the constraints \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is set to `i-1`. This implies that `i` is being decremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `v` is set to `i-1` if `v` was equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration; otherwise, `v` remains unchanged.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(f'? 1 {i * n}', flush=True)
   ```

### Analysis:
- The print statement uses an f-string to format the output.
- It prints the string `'?'` followed by the number `1`, and then the product of `i` and `n`.

### Determining Values:
- We know `n` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `i` is `i-1` from its previous value, so it is one less than its previous value.
- The specific value of `i` is not directly provided, but we can express the printed output in terms of `i` and `n`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output a formatted string where:
- The first character is `?`.
- The second part is the number `1`.
- The third part is the product of `i` and `n`.

Given that `i` is `i-1` from its previous value, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `i` without more context. However, we can describe the output precisely in terms of `i` and `n`.

Output: **? 1 [i * n] (where i is one less than its previous value and n is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4)**
