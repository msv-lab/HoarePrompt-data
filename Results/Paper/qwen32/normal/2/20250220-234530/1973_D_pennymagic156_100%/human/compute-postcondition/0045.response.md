To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition:

The `while` loop condition is `cnt and l < n + 1`.

- `cnt` must be truthy (non-zero) for the loop to execute.
- `l` must be less than `n + 1` for the loop to execute.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `i` is 2 (not relevant to the loop condition).
- `n` must be at least `k + 1` (this condition is already given and does not need adjustment here).
- `k` remains unchanged (not relevant to the loop condition).
- `v` remains unchanged (not relevant to the loop condition).
- `cnt` is `k` (must be non-zero for the loop to execute).
- `l` is 1 (must be less than `n + 1` for the loop to execute).
- Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1` (already satisfied by `cnt` being `k` and `l` being 1).

From the above analysis:
- Since `cnt` is `k`, for the loop to execute, `k` must be non-zero.
- `l` is 1, and as long as `n` is at least 2 (`n + 1` would be at least 3), the condition `l < n + 1` will be satisfied.

Therefore, the only requirement is that `k` must be non-zero.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least `k + 1`, `k` must be non-zero, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is `k`, `l` is 1, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`**
