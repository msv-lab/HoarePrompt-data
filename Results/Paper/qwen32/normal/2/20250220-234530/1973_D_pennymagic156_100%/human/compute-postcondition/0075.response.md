The given code snippet reassigns the value of `l` using the expression `func_2() + 1`. Since `func_2()` returns a value less than 5, the new value of `l` will be between 1 and 5 (inclusive).

The other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `v`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is at least 5, `k` is 2, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` must be non-zero, `l` is a value between 1 and 5 (inclusive)**.
