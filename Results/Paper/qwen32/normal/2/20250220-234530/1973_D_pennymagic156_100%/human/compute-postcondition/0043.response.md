To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Here's the given information:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- `n` must be at least `k`.
- `k` remains unchanged.
- `v` remains unchanged.
- `cnt` is 0.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1` after `k` iterations.
- Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.

The loop condition is `for i in range(1, n // k + 1)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n // k + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `n` must still satisfy the condition `n // k + 1 > 2`, which simplifies to `n // k > 1` or `n > k`.

Since `n` must be at least `k` and `n > k` for the loop to continue, we can deduce that `n` must be at least `k + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least `k + 1`, `k` remains unchanged, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1` after `k` iterations, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`**.
