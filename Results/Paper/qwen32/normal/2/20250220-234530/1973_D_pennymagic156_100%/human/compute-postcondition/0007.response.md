The code snippet provided is just a `break` statement, which means it will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is placed in. However, there is no loop or conditional block shown in the context provided, so the `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `k`, or `v`. The variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\); `v` is the value of `i`.**
