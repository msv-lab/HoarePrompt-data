To determine the output state, we need to consider the effect of the line `l = func_2() + 1`. Since the function `func_2()` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine its exact return value. However, we know that `l` will be updated to the value returned by `func_2()` plus one.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least `k`, `k` must be non-zero, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is `k`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`**.

This means `l` is now equal to whatever `func_2()` returns plus one, while all other variables retain their initial values and constraints.
