To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to analyze the given conditions and how they evolve with each iteration.

From the provided information, we know:
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n // k`.
- For each iteration, it runs a nested `while` loop that decrements `cnt` from `k` to 0 and updates `l` based on the value returned by `func_2()`.
- The loop breaks if `cnt` reaches 0 and `l` equals `n + 1`, printing `! {i * v}` and calling `func_2()` before returning.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations:
- After the 1st iteration: `i` is 1, `n` must be at least `k`, `k` remains unchanged, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1` after `k` iterations.
- After the 2nd iteration: `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3, `k` is 2, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and must be less than 4.
- After the 3rd iteration: `i` is 3, `n` is at least 5, `k` is 2, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1`.

From these states, we can infer that the loop continues as long as `i` does not reach `n // k + 1` and the condition `cnt == 0 and l == n + 1` is not met.

If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, the final state will be:
- `i` will be equal to `n // k + 1` (since the loop runs until `i` reaches this value).
- `v` will be the last value returned by `func_2()` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking.
- `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `n // k + 1`, `v` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop are completed without any break, the variable `i` will have reached the value `n // k + 1`, the variable `v` will still hold its last updated value from `func_2()`, and the variables `n` and `k` will retain their original values.
