The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the loop statement, `i` starts from `n` and decrements by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 1. The loop condition is dependent on `i`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i-1`. To proceed with the next iteration, `i` should be incremented back to its value at the beginning of the previous iteration.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `i-1`.
2. For the next iteration to occur, `i` needs to be `i` (its value at the start of the previous iteration).
3. The values of `n`, `k`, and `v` remain unchanged as per the problem statement.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\); `i` is `i`; `v` is the return value of `func_2()`**.
