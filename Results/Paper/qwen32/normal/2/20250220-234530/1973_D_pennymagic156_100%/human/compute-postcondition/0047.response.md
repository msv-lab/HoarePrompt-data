To determine the new state after executing the given code snippet, let's analyze the changes:

Initial State: 
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be at least `k + 1`
- `k` must be non-zero
- `v` remains unchanged
- `cnt` is `k`
- `l` is 1
- Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`

Code Snippet:
```python
l = func_2() + 1
```

The only variable that changes here is `l`. It is reassigned to the value returned by `func_2()` plus 1.

Since the function `func_2()` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact return value. However, we know that `l` will be set to whatever `func_2()` returns, plus 1.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `i` remains 2
- `n` must be at least `k + 1`
- `k` must be non-zero
- `v` remains unchanged
- `cnt` remains `k`
- `l` is now `func_2() + 1`
- The condition "Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`" still holds because `l` has been updated and is no longer 1 (assuming `func_2()` does not return -1).

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least `k + 1`, `k` must be non-zero, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is `k`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`**
