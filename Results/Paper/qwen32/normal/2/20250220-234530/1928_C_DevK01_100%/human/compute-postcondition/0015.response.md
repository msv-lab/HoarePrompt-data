The code snippet increments the variable `i` by 1. No other variables (`q`, `w`, `M`) are modified by this code.

Given the initial state:
- `q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ `x` < `n` ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples.
- `w` is an integer that satisfies `w == w // 1` and `w >= x - 1`, and `w` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- If `q % i == 0` and `q // i >= x - 1` is true, then `M` is a list containing the integer `q // i`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `M`.

After executing `i += 1`, the value of `i` changes from 1 to 2. The conditions for modifying `M` remain unchanged as they depend on the current value of `i` which has now increased.

Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ `x` < `n` ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `w` is an integer that satisfies `w == w // 1` and `w >= x - 1`, and `w` must be greater than 1; `i` is 2.**
