Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ `x` < `n` ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. If `w` is an integer that satisfies `w == w // 1` and `w >= x - 1`, then `M` is a list containing the single element `w`. Otherwise, `M` remains an empty list. `i` is 1.
Code of the loop:
while i < w:
    if q % i == 0:
        if i >= x - 1:
            M += [i]
        if q // i >= x - 1:
            M += [q // i]
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ `x` < `n` ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `w` is an integer that satisfies `w == w // 1` and `w >= x - 1`, and `w` must be greater than 1; `i` is 2.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ `x` < `n` ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `w` is greater than 2; `i` is 3. If the length of `q` modulo `i` equals 0, and if `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` for any tuple `(n, x)` in `q`, then `M` includes the value 2. Additionally, if the length of `q` modulo `i` equals 0, and `q // i >= x - 1` for any tuple `(n, x)` in `q`, `M` includes the result of `n // i` for that tuple. Since there is no else part, no other changes occur if the condition `len(q) % i == 0` is not met.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ `x` < `n` ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `w` is greater than 3; `i` is 4. If `q % i == 0` and `q // i >= x - 1`, then `M` is set to `[3, 0, 1, 1]`. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
