The given code snippet contains a mistake: `q // i` is not a valid operation because `q` is a list of tuples, and the `//` operator cannot be used directly on a list. However, assuming the intention was to perform an operation on each element of the list `q`, let's consider a corrected version of the code where we apply the operation to each tuple in the list.

Given the context, let's assume the intention was to append the result of some operation involving `i` to the list `M` for each tuple `(n, x)` in `q`. Since the exact operation is not specified, let's assume the operation is `n // i` (integer division of `n` by `i`) for each tuple `(n, x)` in `q`.

Here is the corrected and assumed code:
```python
M += [n // i for n, x in q]
```

Now, let's determine the output state:

- `q` remains a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ `x` < `n` ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples.
- `w` remains greater than 2.
- `i` remains 2.
- `M` will include the value 2 if `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` for any tuple `(n, x)` in `q`.
- `M` will also include the results of `n // i` for each tuple `(n, x)` in `q`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ `x` < `n` ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `w` is greater than 2; `i` is 2; `M` includes the value 2 if `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` for any tuple `(n, x)` in `q`, and `M` also includes the results of `n // i` for each tuple `(n, x)` in `q`.**
