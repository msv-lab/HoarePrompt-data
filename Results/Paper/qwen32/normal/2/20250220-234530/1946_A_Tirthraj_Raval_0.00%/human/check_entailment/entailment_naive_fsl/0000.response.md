Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The code sorts the array `a` which is correct as we need to find the median.
2. **Finding the Median Index**: The code calculates the median index `p` using `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, which is also correct for finding the middle element in a zero-indexed array.
3. **Counting Occurrences of the Median**: The code counts the occurrences of the median value `a[p]` and prints this count. However, this count does not represent the number of operations needed to increase the median.

The main issue here is that counting the occurrences of the median does not help in determining how many increments are required to make the median larger. Instead, we need to determine the smallest number of increments that will ensure the median increases.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
- Sort the array.
- Identify the current median.
- Determine the smallest number of increments needed to make the median larger than its current value.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    """Median of Array"""
    import heapq
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
        current_median = a[p]
        
        # We need to find the smallest number of increments to make the median larger than current_median
        operations = 0
        if n % 2 == 1:
            # Odd length, only need to consider the middle element
            while p < n and a[p] <= current_median:
                operations += 1
                a[p] += 1
        else:
            # Even length, need to consider the two middle elements
            while p < n and (a[p] <= current_median or a[p + 1] <= current_median):
                operations += 1
                a[p] += 1
                if p + 1 < n and a[p + 1] <= current_median:
                    operations += 1
                    a[p + 1] += 1
        
        print(operations)

# This is a simplified version and might not be optimal for large inputs.
# For large inputs, a more efficient approach using heaps or other data structures might be necessary.
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it simply counts the occurrences of the median value instead of calculating the minimum number of increments needed to increase the median. Therefore, the Correctness is **False**.
