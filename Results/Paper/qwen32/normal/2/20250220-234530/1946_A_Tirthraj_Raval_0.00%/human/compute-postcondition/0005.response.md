The code sorts the list `a`. After sorting, the elements of `a` are in non-decreasing order. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the new input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.**
