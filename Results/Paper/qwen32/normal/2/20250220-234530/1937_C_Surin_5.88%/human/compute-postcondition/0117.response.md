The provided code snippet includes a call to `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream. This operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program; it only ensures that any buffered output is written to the console immediately.

Given that none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, `prev`, `kp`, `r`, `i`) are modified by the `sys.stdout.flush()` call, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i`, `v2` is `i + 1`, `prev` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is `n-1`, `r` is the input string, `i` is `i + 1`.**
