Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine the output:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `g` is set to 0.
- `v1` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `v2` is set to `n-1`.
- `prev` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '>', or 0 if no such `i` exists.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement is a formatted string that outputs the values of `prev` and `v1`.
- `prev` is defined as the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '>', or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `v1` is defined as the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists.

### Output Description:
- The output will be in the format `! {prev} {v1}`.
- Since the exact values of `prev` and `v1` depend on the sequence of characters in `r` (which is not provided), we can only describe them based on their definitions.

### Final Output:
Output: **! {prev} {v1} (where prev is the highest value of i for which r was '>', or 0 if no such i exists, and v1 is the highest value of i for which r was '<', or 0 if no such i exists)**
