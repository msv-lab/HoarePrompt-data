Let's break down the initial state and the variables involved to determine what will be printed by the `print` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This represents the number of test cases, but it does not directly affect the current print statement.
- `n`: An integer greater than 1. This likely represents the length of some sequence or array.
- `g`: Initialized to 0. Its purpose is not clear from the given context.
- `v1`: The highest index `i` where `r` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `v2`: Set to `n-1`. This variable is not used in the print statement.
- `prev`: Set to `i` if `r` is '>', otherwise remains unchanged.
- `kp`: Incremented by 1 for each iteration. This variable is not used in the print statement.
- `r`: The input character, either '>' or '<'.
- `i`: Incremented by 1 from its previous value in each iteration. If `r` is '>', `prev` is updated to `i`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

This means we need to determine the values of `v1`, `i`, and `prev` at the point of execution.

#### Values of Variables:
- `v1`: The highest index `i` where `r` was '<'. If no such `i` exists, `v1` is 0.
- `i`: The current index, which has been incremented by 1 from its previous value in each iteration.
- `prev`: Updated to `i` if `r` is '>', otherwise remains unchanged.

### Determining the Output:
Given the initial state and the behavior described, let's consider the possible scenarios:

1. **Initial Iteration**:
   - If this is the very first iteration, `i` would be 0.
   - Since `v1` is initialized to 0 (no previous '<' encountered), `v1` remains 0.
   - `prev` is also initialized to 0 (since no '>' has been encountered).

2. **Subsequent Iterations**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - `v1` will update to the highest index `i` where `r` was '<'.
   - `prev` will update to `i` if `r` is '>', otherwise it will retain its previous value.

Without specific values for `r` across iterations, we can only describe the values in terms of their definitions.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the current values of `v1`, `i`, and `prev` formatted as specified. Given the initial conditions and the described behavior, the output can be precisely described as follows:

Output: **? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev] (where v1 is the highest index i where r was '<' or 0 if no such i exists, i is the current index, and prev is i if r is '>', otherwise it retains its previous value)**
