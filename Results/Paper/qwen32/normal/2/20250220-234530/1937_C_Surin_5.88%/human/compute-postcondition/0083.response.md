The code snippet `r = input()` assigns the value of user input to the variable `r`. This means `r` will now hold whatever string the user inputs. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, `prev`, `kp`) are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '<' or 0 if no such `i` exists, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0, `kp` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, `r` is the user input**.
