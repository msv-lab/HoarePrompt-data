The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (which we don't know exactly, but it's between 1 and `n-1`), `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is `i` if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` remains 0, and `r` is an input string.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` should remain the same as it is the upper limit of the range.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be incremented by 1.
- `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is `i` if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` remains 0, and `r` is an input string, `i` is incremented by 1**
