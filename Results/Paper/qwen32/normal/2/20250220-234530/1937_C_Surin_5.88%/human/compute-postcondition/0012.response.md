The code assigns the value of `v2` to `v1`. Given that `v2` is initially the value of `i`, after the assignment, `v1` will also hold the value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the value of `i`, `v2` is the value of `i`, `r` is the user's input, and `r` equals `<`.**
