Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `g` is initialized to 0.
- `v1` is the index of the maximum element in the array.
- `v2` is initialized to \(n-1\).
- `prev` is initialized to 0.
- `kp` is initialized to \(n-1\).

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

### Analysis:
- `v1` is the index of the maximum element in the array. Since the array is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `v1`, but it is an integer between 0 and \(n-1\).
- `i` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, this variable is undefined, and trying to use it would result in a `NameError`. However, since the task requires us to assume the code runs without errors, we should consider if there might be a typo or missing definition. Given the context, let's assume `i` was intended to be `v2` or another variable that is defined elsewhere in the code. Since `i` is not defined, we cannot determine its value.
- `prev` is explicitly defined as 0.
- `v1` appears twice in the print statement, so its value will be repeated.

Given the above analysis, the output will include `v1` twice and `prev` once, with `i` being undefined. Since `i` is undefined, the code as written would raise an error. However, assuming the intention was to use `v2` instead of `i`, the output would be:

### Assumed Corrected Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v2} {v1} {prev}')
```

### Final Output:
Output: **? [v1] [n-1] [v1] 0 (where v1 is the index of the maximum element in the array and n-1 is the value of v2)**

However, since the original statement includes `i` which is undefined, the precise output based on the given information is that the code would raise an error. But adhering to the task requirement to provide the most precise description possible based on the precondition, we assume the corrected version:

Output: **? [v1] [n-1] [v1] 0 (where v1 is the index of the maximum element in the array and n-1 is the value of v2)**
