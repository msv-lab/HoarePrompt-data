The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was some value between 1 and `n-1` (inclusive), and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it should still be less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³
- `n` is greater than 1
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is the index of the maximum element in the array
- `v2` is `n-1`
- `prev` is `i` if `r` equals `'>'`, otherwise `prev` remains unchanged
- `kp` is `n-1`
- `r` is the input string

Since only `i` and `n` can be adjusted, and `n` remains the same, we increment `i` by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the index of the maximum element in the array, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is `i` if `r` equals `'>'`, otherwise `prev` remains unchanged, `kp` is `n-1`, `r` is the input string, `i` is incremented by 1**
