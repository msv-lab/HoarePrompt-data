The given code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `v2`. Since the initial state specifies that `v2` is `n-1`, and the code changes `v2` to `i`, the new value of `v2` will be whatever `i` is at the point of execution.

However, the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `v2` after the assignment. We only know that `v2` will take on the value of `i`.

Given this, the output state will reflect the updated value of `v2` while keeping the other variables unchanged unless they are also affected by the code snippet, which they are not in this case.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is `i`, `prev` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is `n-1`**.
