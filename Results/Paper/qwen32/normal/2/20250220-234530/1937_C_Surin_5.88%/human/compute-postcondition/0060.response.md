The code snippet `r = input('')` reads an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `r`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, `prev`, or `kp`. The only change is that `r` now holds the value of the user's input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is `i`, `prev` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '>', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is incremented by 1, `r` is the user's input.**
