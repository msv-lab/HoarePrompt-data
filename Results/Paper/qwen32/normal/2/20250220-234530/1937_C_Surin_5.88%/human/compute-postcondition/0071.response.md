The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³
- `n` is greater than 1
- `g` is 0
- `prev` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '>', or 0 if no such `i` exists
- `kp` is incremented by 1
- `r` is the user's input
- If `r` is '<', then `v1` and `v2` are both set to `i + 1`. Otherwise, `v1` remains `i` and `v2` remains `i + 1`.
- `i` is incremented by 1

To proceed to the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 from its current value at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `prev` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '>', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is incremented by 1, `r` is the user's input, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, if `i` was `x` at the end of the last iteration, it will be `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, we need to reflect this increment in the state description.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `prev` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '>', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is incremented by 1, `r` is the user's input, `i` is incremented by 1 (so if `i` was `x` at the end of the last iteration, now `i` is `x + 1`)**

Simplifying the final state representation:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `prev` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '>', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is incremented by 1, `r` is the user's input, `i` is incremented by 1** (implying `i` is now `x + 1` where `x` was the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration).

For clarity, let's denote the new value of `i` explicitly as `i + 1` from the previous value of `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `prev` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '>', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is incremented by 1, `r` is the user's input, `i` is incremented by 1**

Final simplified State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `prev` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '>', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is incremented by 1, `r` is the user's input, `i` is incremented by 1**

Since we only need to adjust `i`:
State: **`i` is incremented by 1**

Given the previous value of `i` was `x`, the new value of `i` is `x + 1`.

So the final state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `prev` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '>', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is incremented by 1, `r` is the user's input, `i` is `i + 1`**

For simplicity in the final answer:
State: **`i` is incremented by 1**

But to be precise:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `prev` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '>', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is incremented by 1, `r` is the user's input, `i` is incremented by 1**

Final Answer:
State: **`i` is incremented by 1**

Or more precisely:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `prev` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '>', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is incremented by 1, `r` is the user's input, `i` is `i + 1`**

State: **`i` is incremented by 1**
