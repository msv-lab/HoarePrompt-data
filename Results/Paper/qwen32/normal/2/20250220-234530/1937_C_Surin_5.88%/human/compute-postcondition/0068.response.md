Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i`, `v2` is `i + 1`, `prev` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '>', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is incremented by 1, and `r` is the user's input, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that `r` is now assigned the value of the user's input. All other variables retain their previous values.
