The code snippet `r = input()` assigns the value of the new input string to the variable `r`. None of the other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the index of the maximum element in the array, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is `i` if `r` equals `'>'`, otherwise `prev` remains unchanged, `kp` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, and `i` is `i + 1`.**
