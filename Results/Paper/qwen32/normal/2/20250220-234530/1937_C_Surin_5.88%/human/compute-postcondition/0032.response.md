The given Python code snippet includes a call to `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the console immediately. However, this operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Given the initial state, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, `prev`) are modified by the `sys.stdout.flush()` call. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0**.
