The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it defines the upper limit of the loop.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, and assuming that the loop condition `i < n` is still satisfied, `i` should be incremented by 1 to start the next iteration.

So, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize that `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '<' or 0 if no such `i` exists, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is `i` if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` remains unchanged, `kp` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, `r` is the input character (either '>' or '<'), `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `r` is '>', `prev` is updated to `i`. `i` is now `i + 1`**
