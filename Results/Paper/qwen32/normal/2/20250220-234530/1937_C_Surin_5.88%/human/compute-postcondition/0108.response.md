Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `g` is initialized to 0.
- `v1` is initialized to 0.
- `v2` is initialized to `i`. However, there is no mention of `i` being defined in the initial state, so we assume `i` is a placeholder or a specific value that needs to be determined from context. Since it's not specified, we'll treat `v2` as `i` as given.
- `prev` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '>', or 0 if no such `i` exists. There is no mention of `r` or its values, so we cannot determine the exact value of `prev` from the given information.
- `kp` is initialized to `n-1`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `v1` is 0.
- `v2` is `i`, but since `i` is not explicitly defined, we'll keep it as `i` in our output description.

### Output Calculation:
Given the values of `v1` and `v2`, the print statement will output:
- `v1` twice, which is `0` twice.
- `v2` twice, which is `i` twice.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 i i (where i is the value assigned to v2)**
