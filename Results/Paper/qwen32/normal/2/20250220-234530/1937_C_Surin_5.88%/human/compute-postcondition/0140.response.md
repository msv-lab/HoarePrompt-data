The code snippet provided reads a new input string and assigns it to the variable `r`. This means the value of `r` changes to whatever the new input is, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the index of the maximum element in the array, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is `i` if `r` equals `'>'`, otherwise `prev` remains unchanged, `kp` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1.**
