The code assigns the value of `v2` to `v1`. Given that `v2` is equal to `i`, after the assignment, `v1` will also be equal to `i`. The values of `i`, `v2`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `v2` is equal to `i`; `v1` is equal to `i`; `r` is the value of the user input.**
