The provided code snippet includes `sys.stdout.flush()`, which is used to flush the output buffer. This operation does not change the values of any variables in the program. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, `prev`, `kp`, `r`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the index of the maximum element in the array, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is `i` if `r` equals `'>'`, otherwise `prev` remains unchanged, `kp` is `n-1`, `r` is the input string, `i` is incremented by 1**.
