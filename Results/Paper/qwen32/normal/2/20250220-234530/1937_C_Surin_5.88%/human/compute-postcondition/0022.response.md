The code snippet `v2 = i` updates the value of `v2` to be equal to the current value of `i`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment.

Given the initial state, `i` is `i + 1` from a previous operation. Therefore, `v2` is now set to this new value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v2` is `i + 1`, `v1` is `i + 1` if `r` equals `<`; otherwise, `v1` remains 0, `i` is `i + 1`**
