The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 again, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Let's break it down:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, so now `i` is the value it had at the start of the previous iteration plus 1.
2. To enter the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 again, making it the value it had at the start of the previous iteration plus 2.
3. `n` must be greater than this new value of `i` for the loop to continue.

Given that `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be `i + 2` (considering `i` from the start of the previous iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `g` is 0, `r` is the new input string, `i` is `i + 2`, `v1` and `v2` are determined based on the value of `r`, `prev` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists, and `kp` is `n-1`**.

However, since we are only adjusting the loop head variables (`i` and `n`), the final state considering only these variables is:
State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `n` is greater than `i + 2`**. 

But to be precise in the context of the full state provided:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `g` is 0, `r` is the new input string, `i` is `i + 2`, `v1` and `v2` are determined based on the value of `r`, `prev` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists, and `kp` is `n-1`**.

Since `v1` and `v2` depend on `r` and `i`, and `prev` and `kp` are not part of the loop head, we focus on `i` and `n` for the loop continuation condition:
State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `n` is greater than `i + 2`**.

For clarity in the required format:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `g` is 0, `r` is the new input string, `i` is `i + 2`, `prev` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists, and `kp` is `n-1`**.

But strictly adhering to only adjusting the loop head variables:
State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `n` is greater than `i + 2`**.
