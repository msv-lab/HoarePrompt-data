The given code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `v2`. The initial state specifies that `v2` is initially `i`, and this assignment does not change its value since it is already `i`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `g`, and `v1` remain unchanged by the code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v2` is `i`, `v1` is `i` if `r` equals `<`; otherwise, `v1` remains 0**.
