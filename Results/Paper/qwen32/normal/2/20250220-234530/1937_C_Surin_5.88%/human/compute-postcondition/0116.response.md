To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
2. `n` is greater than 1.
3. `g` is initialized to 0.
4. `v1` is set to `i`.
5. `v2` is set to `i + 1`.
6. `prev` is the highest index `i` where `r` was `'>'` or 0 if no such `i` exists.
7. `kp` is set to `n - 1`.
8. `r` is the input string.
9. `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`).

### Variables in the Print Statement:
- `v1` is `i` (before it was incremented).
- `v2` is `i + 1`.

### Analysis:
Given the print statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```
We need to substitute the values of `v1` and `v2` into the string.

- `v1` is `i` (before incrementing `i`).
- `v2` is `i + 1`.

So, the print statement will output:
- `?` followed by
- `v1` (which is `i`),
- `v1` again (which is `i`),
- `v2` (which is `i + 1`),
- `v2` again (which is `i + 1`).

### Final Output:
The output will be in the format:
```
? i i (i + 1) (i + 1)
```

Thus, the final answer is:
Output: **? [i] [i] [i + 1] [i + 1] (where i is the current value of i before it is incremented)**
