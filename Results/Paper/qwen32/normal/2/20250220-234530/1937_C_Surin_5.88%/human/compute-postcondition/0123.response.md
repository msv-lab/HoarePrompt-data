To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's carefully analyze the initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:** It is defined as `i = i + 2`. This means that `i` is being incremented by 2. However, since there is no initial value provided for `i`, we cannot determine its exact value. We can only say that it is increased by 2 from whatever its previous value was.
2. **Variable `n`:** It is stated that `n` is greater than `i + 2`. This provides a constraint on `n` but does not give us its exact value.
3. **Variable `v2`:** It is defined as `v2 = i + 2`. Given that `i` is `i + 2` from its previous value, `v2` will be the same as the new value of `i`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

- **Variable `v1`:** This variable is not mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, we do not have any information about its value.
- **Variable `v2`:** As determined from the initial state, `v2` is equal to `i + 2`. Since `i` is `i + 2` from its previous value, `v2` will be the new value of `i`.

### Conclusion:
Given the lack of specific values for `i` and `v1`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables. The exact numerical values cannot be determined without additional information.

Output: **? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2] (where v1 is an unknown value and v2 is the value of i + 2, with i being incremented by 2 from its previous value)**
