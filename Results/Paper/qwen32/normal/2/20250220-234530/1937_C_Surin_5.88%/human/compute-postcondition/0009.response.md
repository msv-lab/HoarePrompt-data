The given code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This command flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all output is written to the standard output immediately. It does not affect the values of any variables.

Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is the value of `i`.**
