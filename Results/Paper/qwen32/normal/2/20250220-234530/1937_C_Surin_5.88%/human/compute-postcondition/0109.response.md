The code snippet provided is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered data is written to the console. However, it does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Given the initial state, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, `prev`, `kp`) are modified by this function call. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is `i`, `prev` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is `n-1`**.
