The given code snippet defines a lambda function `I` that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split string into an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers. This lambda function does not modify any existing variables (`t`, `n`, `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}`) but rather sets up a way to read input for future use.

Since the code does not execute the lambda function or change the values of `t`, `n`, or the sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}`, these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴. The sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}. `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split string into an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers.**
