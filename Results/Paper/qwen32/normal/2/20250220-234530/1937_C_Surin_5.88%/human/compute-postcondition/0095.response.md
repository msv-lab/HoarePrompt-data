The given code snippet includes a call to `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the console immediately. However, this operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Given the initial state and the fact that `sys.stdout.flush()` does not modify any variables, the output state will be identical to the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '<' or 0 if no such `i` exists, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is `i` if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` remains unchanged, `kp` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, `r` is the input character (either '>' or '<'), `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `r` is '>', `prev` is updated to `i`. `i` is now `i + 1`**.
