In the given initial state, the variable `t` is described as an integer within the range 1 to 1000, inclusive, and `s` is described as the input string. However, these variables are not used in the provided Python code snippet. The code snippet simply contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any variables (`t` or `s`), the output will be exactly the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
