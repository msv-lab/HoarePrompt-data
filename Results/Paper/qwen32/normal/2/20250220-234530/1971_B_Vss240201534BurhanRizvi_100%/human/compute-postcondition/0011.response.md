Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the input string with a length greater than 1 and does not consist of all identical characters, `s2` is a shuffled version of the string `s`. If `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is the string `s` rotated by moving its first character to the end. Otherwise, `s2` remains a shuffled version of `s`.**
