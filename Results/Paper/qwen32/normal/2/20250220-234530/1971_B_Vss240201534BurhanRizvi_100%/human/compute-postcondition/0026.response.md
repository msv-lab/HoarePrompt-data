Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is the input string. If the length of `s` is 1, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `s` consists of the same character repeated more than once, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `s2` is the string formed by moving the first character of `s` to the end.**
