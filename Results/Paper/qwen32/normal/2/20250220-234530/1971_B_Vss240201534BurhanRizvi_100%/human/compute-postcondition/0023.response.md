Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `s` is the input string.
- If `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `s2` is the string formed by moving the first character of `s` to the end.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. This statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `s`, or `s2`. The `print` statement will execute regardless of the conditions or transformations applied to `s2`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
