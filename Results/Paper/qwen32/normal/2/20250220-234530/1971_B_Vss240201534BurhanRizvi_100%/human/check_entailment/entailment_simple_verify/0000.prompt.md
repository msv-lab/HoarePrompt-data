You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)



- Annotated Code: 
import random

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        
    #State: After executing all iterations, for each input string `s`, the program outputs "No" if `s` has a length of 1 or consists of identical characters (length > 1). Otherwise, it outputs "Yes" followed by a modified version of `s` (`s2`), which is either a shuffled version of `s` or `s` rotated by one position if the shuffle didn't change the order.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

### Program Analysis:

The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` can be rearranged to form a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`. Here's the breakdown of the logic:

1. **Single Character Case (`len(s) == 1`)**:
   - The program correctly outputs "NO" because a single character cannot be rearranged to form a different string.

2. **All Characters Same (`len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1`)**:
   - The program correctly outputs "NO" because if all characters are the same, any rearrangement will result in the same string.

3. **Other Cases**:
   - The program uses `random.sample(s, len(s))` to generate a random permutation of the string `s`.
   - If the generated permutation `s2` is the same as the original string `s`, it swaps the first and second characters to ensure `s2` is different from `s`.
   - It then outputs "YES" followed by the rearranged string `s2`.

### Potential Issues:

- **Randomness and Edge Cases**: While the use of `random.sample` generally works, there is a small chance that the random permutation could still be the same as the original string, especially for short strings. However, the program handles this by swapping the first two characters if the permutation is the same as the original string.
- **Edge Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the edge cases where the string has only one character or all characters are the same.

### Testing the Program:

Let's consider some edge cases and typical cases:

1. **Single Character**:
   - Input: `"d"`
   - Output: `"NO"` (Correct)

2. **All Characters Same**:
   - Input: `"aaaaa"`
   - Output: `"NO"` (Correct)

3. **Typical Case**:
   - Input: `"codeforces"`
   - Possible Output: `"YES\nforcodesec"` (Correct, as long as the output is a valid rearrangement)

4. **Short String with Different Characters**:
   - Input: `"co"`
   - Possible Output: `"YES\noc"` (Correct)

5. **Longer String with Repeated Characters**:
   - Input: `"xxxxy"`
   - Possible Output: `"YES\nxxyxx"` (Correct)

6. **String with All Different Characters**:
   - Input: `"nutdealer"`
   - Possible Output: `"YES\nundertale"` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program and testing it against various cases, it appears that the program correctly handles all specified scenarios according to the problem description. There are no obvious issues or edge cases that the program fails to address.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
