The initial state provides us with the following information:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
- `s` is a string with a length greater than 1 and does not consist of all identical characters.
- `s2` is either a shuffled version of `s` or a rotation of `s` if `s` equals `s2`.

However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is simply `print('Yes')`. This means that regardless of the values of `t`, `s`, and `s2`, the string `'Yes'` will be printed.

Let's break it down:

- The value of `t` does not affect the print statement.
- The content and properties of the string `s` do not influence the print statement.
- Whether `s2` is a shuffled version of `s` or a rotation of `s` also does not impact the print statement.

Given this, the output of the print statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or their values.

Output: **Yes**
