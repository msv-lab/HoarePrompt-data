Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is the input string. If the length of `s` is 1, `s` remains unchanged. If the length of `s` is greater than 1 and `s` consists of identical characters, `s` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `s2` is a shuffled version of `s`. If `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is the string `s` rotated by moving its first character to the end. Otherwise, `s2` remains a shuffled version of `s`.**
