Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `s` is a string consisting of identical characters and has a length greater than 1.

The Python code snippet is:
```python
print('No')
```

Explanation:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'No'`. This output does not depend on the values of `t` or `s`. The values of `t` and `s` are provided to set the context but do not influence the content of the `print` statement.

Output: **No**
