The code shuffles the characters of the string `s` and assigns the shuffled string to `s2`. The original string `s` remains unchanged, and `t` retains its original value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the input string with a length greater than 1 and does not consist of all identical characters, `s2` is a shuffled version of the string `s`.**
