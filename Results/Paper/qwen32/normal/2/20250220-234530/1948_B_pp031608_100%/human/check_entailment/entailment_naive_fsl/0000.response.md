Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the transformation and sorting process as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for splitting elements and checking if the resulting array can be sorted is flawed.

Let's analyze the problematic part of the code:

```python
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
```

This code attempts to split `arr[i-1]` if `arr[i]` is smaller than `arr[i-1]`. However, it only checks if the combined list of the digits of `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]` is sorted, which is not sufficient to ensure that the entire array can be sorted after performing the operations.

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4
12 3 45 6
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
- The array is `[12, 3, 45, 6]`.
- Splitting `12` results in `[1, 2, 3, 45, 6]`, which is still not sorted.
- No further valid splits can sort the array.

However, the program will output `YES` for this input because it incorrectly assumes that splitting `12` and checking the local segment `[1, 2, 3]` is enough to determine if the entire array can be sorted.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to its incomplete and flawed logic for handling the transformations and sorting conditions.
