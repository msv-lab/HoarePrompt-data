Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an integer such that m ≥ 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is `m - 2`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`, `ans` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the only impact of the code is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
