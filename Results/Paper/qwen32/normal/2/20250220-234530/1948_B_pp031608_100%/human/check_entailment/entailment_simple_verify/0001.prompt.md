You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: After processing all `n` test cases, the program will have printed "YES" or "NO" for each test case based on whether the sequence can be transformed into a non-decreasing sequence. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array elements `arr`.

2. **Logic to Check Sorted Order:**
   - The program iterates over the array from the end to the beginning.
   - If it finds an element `arr[i]` that is smaller than the previous element `arr[i-1]`, it attempts to split `arr[i-1]` into its digits and checks if the resulting list (digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`) can be sorted.
   - If the list cannot be sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without setting `ans` to `False`, it prints "YES", otherwise "NO".

3. **Issues in the Logic:**
   - The logic assumes that splitting `arr[i-1]` and checking if the resulting list can be sorted is sufficient to determine if the entire array can be sorted.
   - However, this approach does not consider the possibility of further splits being necessary for other elements or the effect of those splits on the rest of the array.
   - For example, if `arr[i-1]` is split into multiple digits, those digits might need to be compared with elements before `arr[i-1]` in the array.
   - Additionally, the program only checks if the immediate sublist (digits of `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]`) can be sorted, but it doesn't ensure that the entire array can be sorted after these operations.

### Example to Illustrate the Issue

Consider the following test case:

```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 0
```

The program will correctly handle the first and third test cases. However, for the second test case `[12, 28, 5]`:

- When it reaches `i=2`, it finds `arr[2] < arr[1]` (5 < 28).
- It splits `arr[1]` into `[2, 8]` and checks if `[2, 8, 5]` can be sorted, which it can.
- However, this does not guarantee that the entire array can be sorted. The correct approach would involve more complex checks to ensure that all elements can be rearranged to form a sorted array.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted using the described operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
