Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an integer such that m ≥ 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ans` is False, and at index `i`, `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]; nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. Additionally, `nums` is not sorted, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the only effect of the `break` statement is to exit the most internal loop or if statement.
