The code snippet creates a new list `nums` by concatenating two parts: the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` (converted to a list of integers) and the integer `arr[i]`. 

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `nums`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `arr`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Since `arr[i - 1]` is less than `arr[i]` and both are integers, the digits of `arr[i - 1]` are extracted and converted to a list of integers, and then `arr[i]` is appended to this list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ans` is True, and `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]; nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**
