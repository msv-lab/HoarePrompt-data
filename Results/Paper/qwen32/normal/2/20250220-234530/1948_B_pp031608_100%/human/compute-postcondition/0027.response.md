Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and `ans` remains unchanged unless previously set to `False`.**
