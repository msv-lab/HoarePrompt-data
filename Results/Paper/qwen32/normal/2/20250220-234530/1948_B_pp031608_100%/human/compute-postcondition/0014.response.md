The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop iterates from `m - 1` down to `1`. Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `i` needs to be decremented by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `nums[0]` and `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains True. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, no changes are made to `arr` or `ans`.

Since the loop runs from `m - 1` down to `1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

If at the end of the previous iteration `i` was some value `k`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k - 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `i - 1`**
