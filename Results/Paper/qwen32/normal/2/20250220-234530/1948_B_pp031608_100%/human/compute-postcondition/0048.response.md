The code snippet assigns the first element of the list `nums` to `arr[i - 1]`. This means that the value of `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `nums[0]`.

Given the initial state, `arr` is a list of integers, and `i` is `m - 2`. The variable `nums` is a list where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`. Since the code only modifies `arr[i - 1]` and does not affect other variables unless `nums` is not sorted (which would set `ans` to `False` and break the loop), we only need to update `arr[i - 1]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an integer such that m ≥ 2, `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[i - 1]` is now `nums[0]`, `i` is `m - 2`, `nums` is a list of integers, and `ans` remains unchanged unless `nums` was not sorted, in which case `ans` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
