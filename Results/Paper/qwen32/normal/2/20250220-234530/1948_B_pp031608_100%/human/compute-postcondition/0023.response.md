The given Python code snippet assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `ans`. No other variables are modified by this code.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `ans` is `False`.**
