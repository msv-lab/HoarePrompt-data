The code snippet assigns the first element of the list `nums` to `arr[i - 1]`. Given the initial state, `nums` contains the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. After executing the code, `arr[i - 1]` will be updated to the first element of `nums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an integer such that m ≥ 2, `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[i - 1]` is now `nums[0]`, `i` is `m - 1`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
