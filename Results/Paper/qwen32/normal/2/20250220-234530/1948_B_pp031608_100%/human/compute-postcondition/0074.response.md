Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `arr` is a list where `arr[i - 1]` is the first digit of the original `arr[i - 1]` if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list consisting of the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `ans` is False, `i` is `i - 1`; `nums` is now a list of digits from `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` has been set to `False`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
