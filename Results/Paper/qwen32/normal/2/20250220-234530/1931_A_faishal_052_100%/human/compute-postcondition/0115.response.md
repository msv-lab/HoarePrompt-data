The code appends the value `1` to the list `arr`. This affects the `info` list, which contains `arr` in its sublists. Specifically, the first sublist of `info` is the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it, and the second sublist is `arr` with an additional element based on the value of `lex`.

Since `arr` is modified by appending `1`, the second sublist of `info` will also be updated to include this new element. The first sublist of `info` remains unchanged because sorting and appending `lex` to it would not be affected by simply adding `1` to `arr`.

The values of `j`, `i`, and `lex` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing two sublists (the first being the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it, and the second being the updated `arr` with `1` appended to it), `j` is 0, `i` is 2, and `lex` is decreased by 1 if `lex` < 28, otherwise `lex` is decreased by 26.**
