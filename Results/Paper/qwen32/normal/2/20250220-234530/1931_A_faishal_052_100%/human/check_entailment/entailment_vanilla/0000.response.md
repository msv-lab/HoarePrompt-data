Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Given an integer `n` (representing the sum of the positions of three letters in the alphabet), find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that sums up to `n`.
2. **Constraints**: 
   - Each letter is a lowercase Latin letter.
   - The sum of the positions of these letters is between 3 and 78.
   - The output should be the lexicographically smallest word.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the letters.
   - It iterates twice to determine the first two letters:
     - If `lex` (current value of `n`) is less than 28, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 78, it again appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - It sorts the array `arr` to ensure the letters are in ascending order.
   - It stores the sorted array in `info`.

3. **Generating Output**:
   - For each test case, it converts the positions in `arr` to their corresponding letters using `chr(position + 96)` and concatenates them to form the word.
   - It prints the resulting word.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Logic for Determining Letters**:
  - The logic for determining the first two letters is flawed. The conditions check if `lex` is less than 28 or 52, but this does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest letters.
  - The program does not correctly handle the case where the remaining value after subtracting 26 might still be large enough to require more adjustments.
- **Sorting After Assignment**:
  - Sorting the array after assigning values does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word because the initial assignment might already place larger values first.

### Correct Approach:
- To find the lexicographically smallest word, start with the smallest possible letters ('a', 'a', 'a') and incrementally increase the letters while ensuring the sum equals `n`.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the logic and the approach, the program does not correctly solve the problem.

**Correctness: False**
