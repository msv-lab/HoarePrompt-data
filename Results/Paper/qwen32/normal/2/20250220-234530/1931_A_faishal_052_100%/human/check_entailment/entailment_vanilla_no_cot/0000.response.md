Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Key Points of the Problem:
1. We need to decode an integer back into a 3-letter word.
2. The decoding should result in the lexicographically smallest possible word.
3. Each letter is represented by its position in the alphabet (a=1, b=2, ..., z=26).

### Analysis of the Program:
The program reads multiple test cases and processes each one individually. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the program does:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which represents the encoded value.

2. **Decoding Logic:**
   - For each test case, it initializes an empty list `arr`.
   - It then enters a loop that runs twice, attempting to append either 1 or 26 to `arr` based on the value of `lex` (which starts as `n`).
     - If `lex` is less than 28, it appends 1 and reduces `lex` by 1.
     - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 and reduces `lex` by 26.
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 78, it appends 26 and reduces `lex` by 26.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - It sorts `arr` to ensure the smallest lexicographical order.
   - It converts the values in `arr` to their corresponding letters and constructs the word.

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, it prints the constructed word.

### Issues in the Program:
- The logic for determining the values to append to `arr` is flawed. Specifically, the conditions and the way values are appended do not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word.
- The sorting step after appending values is unnecessary because the values are not being assigned in a way that ensures the smallest possible combination.
- The program does not handle all edge cases correctly, especially when the encoded value is close to the maximum possible value (78).

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that we always choose the smallest possible letters first while ensuring the sum equals the encoded value. A correct approach would involve iterating over possible values for the first two letters and calculating the third letter accordingly.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the provided program, it is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
