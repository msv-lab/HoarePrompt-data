To determine what will be printed, let's break down the provided initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`cases`**: An integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
2. **`info`**: A list containing `cases` sublists. Each sublist contains three integers.
3. **`lex`**: Adjusted based on some rules for each test case. However, `lex` is not used in the provided print statement.
4. **`temp`**: A string constructed from the characters corresponding to the ASCII values derived from the integers in the sublists of `info`. Specifically, `temp` is constructed as follows:
   - For each sublist in `info`, it takes the first integer, adds 96 to it, converts it to a character using `chr()`, and appends it to `temp`.
   - It does the same for the second and third integers in the sublist.
5. **`j`**: Set to 2. This variable is not used in the provided print statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(temp)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `temp` is constructed by iterating over each sublist in `info` and converting each integer in the sublist (after adding 96 to it) into a character using `chr()`. 
- Since `info` contains `cases` sublists, and each sublist has three integers, `temp` will be a string consisting of `3 * cases` characters.
- The exact characters depend on the values in the sublists of `info`.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the `print(temp)` statement will output a string composed of characters derived from the integers in the `info` list after adding 96 to each integer and converting them to characters.

Output: **temp (where temp is a string formed by converting each integer in the sublists of info to a character after adding 96 to it)**
