The code snippet `temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)` appends a character to the `temp` string based on the value of `info[i][j]`. Specifically, it converts the integer value of `info[i][j]` to a corresponding lowercase letter by adding 96 (since 'a' corresponds to ASCII value 97).

Given the initial state:
- `cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100.
- `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists.
- `lex` is adjusted based on the described rules for each test case.
- `temp` is an empty string.
- `j` is 0.

After executing the code snippet:
- `temp` will now contain the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][j] + 96`.
- All other variables (`cases`, `info`, `lex`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, `lex` is adjusted based on the described rules for each test case, `temp` is a string containing the character `chr(info[i][j] + 96)`, `j` is 0.**
