Given the initial state, the code snippet only modifies the value of `lex`. Here's the output state after executing the code:

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing two sublists (the first being the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it, and the second being the updated `arr` with `1` appended to it), `j` is 0, `i` is 2, and `lex` is decreased by 1 if `lex` < 28, otherwise `lex` is decreased by 26; `lex` is now `lex - 1`.**

Natural Language: The value of `lex` is decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
