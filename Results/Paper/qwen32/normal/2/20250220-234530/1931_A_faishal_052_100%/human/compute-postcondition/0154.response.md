The code snippet appends a new character to the string `temp`. This character is determined by converting the ASCII value of `info[i][j] + 96` to its corresponding character using the `chr()` function.

Given:
- `temp` initially contains the character `chr(info[4][3] + 96)`
- `i` is 4
- `j` is 0

The new character appended to `temp` will be `chr(info[4][0] + 96)`.

Therefore, the new `temp` will be the concatenation of the original `temp` and `chr(info[4][0] + 96)`.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, `lex` is adjusted based on the described rules for each test case, `temp` is a string containing the characters `chr(info[4][3] + 96)` and `chr(info[4][0] + 96)`, `j` is 0, `i` is 4**.
