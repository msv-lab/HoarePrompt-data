The code appends the value `26` to the list `arr`. This affects the `info` list, which contains two sublists: the first sublist is `arr` with `lex` appended to it, and the second sublist is `arr` with either `1` appended if `lex` < 28, `26` appended if `lex` > 78, or just `arr` if 28 <= `lex` <= 78.

Since `arr` is modified by appending `26`, the second sublist of `info` will also be updated to reflect this change. The first sublist of `info` will include the new `arr` with the appended `26` and the updated `lex`.

The values of `cases`, `j`, `i`, and `lex` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing two sublists (the first being the updated `arr` with `lex` appended to it, and the second being the updated `arr` with `26` appended to it), `j` is 0, `i` is 2, and `lex` is decreased by 1 if `lex` < 28, otherwise `lex` is decreased by 26.**
