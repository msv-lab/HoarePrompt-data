The only variable in the loop head is `j`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to 1 (inclusive), meaning it will run twice with `j` taking values 0 and 1. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `j` would have taken the value 0 during the first iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next (second) iteration, `j` should be 1.

The other variables (`cases`, `info`, `lex`, and `arr`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is an empty list, `lex` is an integer, and `arr` is a list, `j` is 1**
