The code snippet sorts the list `arr`. This means that the elements within `arr` are rearranged in ascending order. The variables `cases`, `info`, `lex`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100.
- `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr` with `lex` appended to it.
- `lex` is adjusted based on the initial value of `lex`.
- `j` is 1.

After executing `arr.sort()`, only `arr` within `info` is modified to be in sorted order.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing one sublist which is the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it, `lex` is adjusted based on the initial value of `lex`, and `j` is 1.**
