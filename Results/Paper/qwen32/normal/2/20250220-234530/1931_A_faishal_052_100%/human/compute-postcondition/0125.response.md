The code snippet `arr.append(lex)` modifies the list `arr` by adding the element `lex` to its end. Since `info` contains two sublists, with the first being the sorted `arr` with `lex` already appended to it, appending `lex` to `arr` will make `arr` match the first sublist of `info`.

Given the initial state, `info` is structured such that `info[0]` is `arr` with `lex` appended, and `info[1]` is the original `arr`. After executing `arr.append(lex)`, `arr` will now be identical to `info[0]`.

Other variables (`cases`, `j`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing two sublists (the first being the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it, and the second being `arr`), `j` is 1, `i` is 2, `arr` is now equal to `info[0]`.**
