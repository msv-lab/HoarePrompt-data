Postcondition: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is an empty list, `lex` is an integer, and `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than 26, `arr` contains the integer 26. If `lex` is between 26 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` remains an empty list. If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` contains the integer 26. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` remains an empty list.**
