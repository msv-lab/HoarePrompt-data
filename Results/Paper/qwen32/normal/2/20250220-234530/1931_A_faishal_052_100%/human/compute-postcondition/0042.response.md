The code sorts the list `arr`. Given that `arr` originally had up to two elements and now has up to three elements, sorting `arr` will arrange these elements in non-decreasing order. The values of `cases` and `info` remain unchanged, and `lex` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is an empty list, `arr` is a sorted list with up to three elements, `lex` is updated based on the described rules.**
