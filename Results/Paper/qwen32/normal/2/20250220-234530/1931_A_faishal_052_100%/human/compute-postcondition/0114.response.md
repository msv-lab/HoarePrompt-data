The only variable in the loop head is `j`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to 1 (inclusive). Since the loop runs for `j` values of 0 and 1, we need to adjust `j` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration is `j` is 1, the loop will terminate after this iteration because the next value of `j` would be 2, which is outside the range of the loop.

Therefore, to execute one more time, `j` should be set to 0, as this is the starting point of the loop.

State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing two sublists (the first being the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it, and the second being `arr` with either 1 appended to it if `lex` < 28, or 26 appended to it if `lex` > 78, or just `arr` if 28 <= `lex` <= 78), `j` is 0, `i` is 2, and `lex` is decreased by 1 if `lex` < 28, otherwise `lex` is decreased by 26.**
