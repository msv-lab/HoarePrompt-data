You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    info = []
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for j in range(2):
            if lex < 28:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            elif lex <= 78:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        arr.append(lex)
        arr.sort()
        info.append(arr)
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        print(temp)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (where 3 <= n <= 78) and processes it to produce a string of three characters. The string is derived by converting specific values related to `n` into characters using ASCII values, and the function prints this string for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word (consisting of lowercase Latin letters) that sums up to a given integer `n` when the positions of the letters in the alphabet are added together.

### Key Points:
- Each letter has a position from 1 to 26.
- We need to find the smallest possible combination of three such positions that add up to `n`.
- The result should be sorted lexicographically.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `lex`, which represents the encoded value of the word.

2. **Generating Possible Combinations:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the letters.
   - It then enters a loop that runs twice, trying to assign values to the first two positions:
     - If `lex` is less than 28, it assigns 1 to the current position and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is between 28 and 51, it assigns 26 to the current position and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is between 52 and 78, it again assigns 26 to the current position and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - After the loop, it assigns the remaining value of `lex` to the third position.
   - The list `arr` is then sorted to ensure the positions are in ascending order.
   - The sorted list `arr` is appended to the `info` list.

3. **Generating Output:**
   - For each test case stored in `info`, the program constructs a string `temp` by converting each position in `arr` to its corresponding letter using `chr(position + 96)`.
   - The constructed string `temp` is printed as the output for that test case.

### Issues with the Program:
- **Incorrect Logic for Generating Positions:**
  - The logic used to generate the positions is flawed. The program does not correctly handle all possible combinations of three positions that sum up to `n`.
  - Specifically, the conditions for assigning 1 or 26 are too restrictive and do not cover all cases.
- **Lexicographical Order:**
  - While the program sorts the positions, it does not guarantee that the resulting word will be the lexicographically smallest possible word for the given sum `n`.

### Example:
For `n = 24`, the correct smallest word is `"aav"`, but the program might generate something else due to its flawed logic.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the program's logic for generating the positions and ensuring the lexicographically smallest word, the program is not correct.
