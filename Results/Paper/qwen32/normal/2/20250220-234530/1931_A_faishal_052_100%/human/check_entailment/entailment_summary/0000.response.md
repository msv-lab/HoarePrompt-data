### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided code and compare it with the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **Input**: An integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` integers `n` (where 3 <= n <= 78).
2. **Output**: For each integer `n`, output the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to `n` when the positions of the letters in the alphabet are added together.
3. **Lexicographical Order**: The output should be the smallest possible string in alphabetical order among all possible strings that sum up to `n`.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case to read the integer `n`.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The code initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the letters.
   - It then enters a loop that runs twice to determine the first two letters:
     - If `lex` (the remaining value of `n`) is less than 28, it appends `1` to `arr` and subtracts `1` from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is between 28 and 51, it appends `26` to `arr` and subtracts `26` from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is between 52 and 78, it again appends `26` to `arr` and subtracts `26` from `lex`.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - The list `arr` is then sorted to ensure the lexicographically smallest order.
3. **Generating Output**:
   - For each test case, the code constructs a string by converting each element in `arr` to its corresponding character using `chr(value + 96)` and concatenates them.
   - Finally, it prints the resulting string.

#### Issues in the Code:
- **Incorrect Logic for Determining Letters**:
  - The code incorrectly assumes that if `lex` is less than 28, the first letter should be 'a' (position 1). This is not always the case.
  - Similarly, the code incorrectly assigns 'z' (position 26) when `lex` is between 28 and 51 or between 52 and 78. This does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word.
  - The sorting step after appending values to `arr` does not address the issue of incorrect initial assignments.
- **Example Issues**:
  - For `n = 24`, the correct output should be "aav", but the code might assign incorrect values leading to different results.
  - For `n = 70`, the correct output should be "rzz", but the current logic does not ensure this.

#### Correct Approach:
- To find the lexicographically smallest word, the code should start by assigning the smallest possible values to the first two letters and then adjust the third letter accordingly.
- For example, if `n = 24`, the code should try to assign 'a' (1) to the first letter, then adjust the second and third letters to sum up to the remaining value while maintaining the smallest possible letters.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the logic of the provided code, it does not correctly generate the lexicographically smallest word for each test case.

**Correctness: False**
