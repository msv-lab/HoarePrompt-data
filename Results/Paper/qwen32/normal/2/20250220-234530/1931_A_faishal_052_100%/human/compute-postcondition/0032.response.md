The code snippet provided attempts to decrement the variable `lex` by 1. However, `lex` is not defined in the initial state provided. Since `lex` is not defined, the operation `lex = lex - 1` would result in a `NameError` in Python. 

Given the task constraints and the requirement to adhere to the format, we'll assume there was an oversight and `lex` was intended to be part of the initial state. Since it's not, no changes occur to the variables `cases`, `info`, or `j`.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing the element `[1]`, `j` is 2**.
