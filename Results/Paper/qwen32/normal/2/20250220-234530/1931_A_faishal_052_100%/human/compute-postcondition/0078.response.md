Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr` with `26` appended to it, `lex` is `lex - 26` if `lex` < 52 or `lex - 52` if 52 <= `lex` < 78 or unchanged if `lex` > 78, and `j` is 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. The conditions for further adjustments to `lex` are updated accordingly: if `lex` was originally less than 52, it is now `lex - 26`; if `lex` was originally between 52 and 78, it is now `lex - 52`. If `lex` was originally greater than 78, it remains unchanged. The values of `cases`, `info`, and `j` remain the same.
