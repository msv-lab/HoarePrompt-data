The code appends the value `26` to the list `arr`. Since `arr` is part of the `info` list, this change will reflect in `info` as well. The values of `cases`, `lex`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr` with `26` appended to it, `lex` is `lex - 1` if `lex` < 28, `lex - 26` if 28 <= `lex` < 52 or 52 < `lex` <= 78, or unchanged if `lex` > 78, and `j` is 1.**
