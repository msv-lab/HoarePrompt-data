The value of `j` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is a string with more than one character; `count` is 3 if `s[j] != s[j + 1]`, otherwise `count` remains 1; `flag` is True; `j` is less than `len(s) - 1`; `i` is `len(s) + 1`; the characters at index `j` and `j + 1` in `s` are different if `s[j] != s[j + 1]`.**
