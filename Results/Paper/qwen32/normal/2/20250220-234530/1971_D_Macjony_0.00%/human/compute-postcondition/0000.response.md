Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, and for each of the `t` test cases, `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length 1 ≤ |`s`| ≤ 500.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to be an integer value obtained from the input, while the condition regarding the number of test cases and the properties of the strings `s` remain unchanged.
