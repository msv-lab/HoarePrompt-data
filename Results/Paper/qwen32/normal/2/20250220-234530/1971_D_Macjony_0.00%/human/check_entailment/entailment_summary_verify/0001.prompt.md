You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and calculates the number of segments of identical characters in the string, adjusting the count by subtracting one if there is at least one occurrence of '0' immediately followed by '1'. It then prints the adjusted count for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding
We need to find the minimum number of contiguous pieces a binary string can be cut into, such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

### Key Observations
- If the string is already sorted, we need just one piece.
- The transitions from '0' to '1' are critical because they indicate potential cuts.
- However, not every transition requires a separate piece. Specifically, if the string starts with '0's and ends with '1's, the last transition from '0' to '1' does not require an additional piece beyond the necessary ones for previous transitions.

### Program Analysis
Here’s how the program works:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the binary string `s`.
3. It initializes `count` to 1 (indicating at least one piece is needed).
4. It uses a flag `flag` to check if there's at least one transition from '0' to '1'.
5. It iterates through the string, checking for transitions between characters:
   - If a transition occurs (`s[j] != s[j+1]`), it increments `count`.
   - If the transition is specifically from '0' to '1', it sets `flag` to `True`.
6. After the loop, if `flag` is `True`, it decrements `count` by 1 (to account for the last transition not needing an extra piece).
7. It prints the final `count`.

### Correctness Check
- The logic of counting transitions and adjusting for the last transition is sound.
- The program correctly handles cases where the string is already sorted (no transitions).
- It also correctly handles cases with multiple transitions, ensuring the minimum number of pieces is calculated.

### Testing with Examples
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:
1. **Input:** `11010`
   - Transitions: `1->0`, `0->1`, `1->0`
   - `count` after transitions: 4
   - `flag` is `True` (since there's a `0->1` transition)
   - Final `count`: 3
   - **Output:** `3` (correct)

2. **Input:** `00000000`
   - No transitions
   - `count`: 1
   - **Output:** `1` (correct)

3. **Input:** `1`
   - No transitions
   - `count`: 1
   - **Output:** `1` (correct)

4. **Input:** `10`
   - Transition: `1->0`
   - `count` after transitions: 2
   - `flag` is `False` (since there's no `0->1` transition)
   - Final `count`: 2
   - **Output:** `2` (correct)

5. **Input:** `0001111`
   - Transition: `0->1`
   - `count` after transitions: 2
   - `flag` is `True` (since there's a `0->1` transition)
   - Final `count`: 1
   - **Output:** `1` (correct)

6. **Input:** `0110`
   - Transitions: `0->1`, `1->0`
   - `count` after transitions: 3
   - `flag` is `True` (since there's a `0->1` transition)
   - Final `count`: 2
   - **Output:** `2` (correct)

All test cases match the expected output, confirming the program's correctness.

### Conclusion
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of pieces required to rearrange the binary string into a sorted binary string.

Correctness: **True**
