Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is a string with more than one character; `count` is 2; `flag` is True if the character at index `j` in `s` is '0' and the character at index `j + 1` in `s` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False; `j` is 1 if `flag` is True, otherwise `j` remains 0; `i` is `len(s) + 1`; the characters at index `j` and `j + 1` in `s` are different; if `flag` is True, the character at index `j` in `s` is '1' and the character at index `j + 1` in `s` is a character different from '1'.**
