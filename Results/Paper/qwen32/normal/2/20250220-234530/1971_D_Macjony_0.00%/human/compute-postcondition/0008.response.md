The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `flag`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is the input string with length greater than 1; `count` is 2; `flag` is False; `j` is 0; the character at index `j` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `j + 1`.**
