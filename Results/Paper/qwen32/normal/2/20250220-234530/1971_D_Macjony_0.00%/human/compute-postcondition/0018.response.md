The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `j` is 1, after executing the code, `j` becomes 2. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `count`, `flag`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is the input string with length greater than 1; `j` is 2; `count` is increased by 1; `flag` is True.**
