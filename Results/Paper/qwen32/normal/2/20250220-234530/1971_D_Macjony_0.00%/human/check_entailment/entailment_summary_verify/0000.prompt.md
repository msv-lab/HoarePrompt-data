You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and calculates the number of segments of identical characters in the string, adjusting the count by subtracting one if there is at least one occurrence of '0' immediately followed by '1'. It then prints the adjusted count for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the minimum number of pieces to cut a binary string into such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).
- The pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string.
- Each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces.
- We must use all the pieces in the rearrangement.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it processes the binary string `s` to determine the minimum number of cuts required.

Here is the provided program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)
```

### Logic Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `count` is initialized to 1 because at least one piece is always needed.
   - `flag` is used to check if there is a transition from '0' to '1'.
   
2. **Loop through the string**:
   - If `s[j]` is different from `s[j + 1]`, it means we need to make a cut here, so `count` is incremented.
   - If the transition is specifically from '0' to '1', `flag` is set to `True`.
   - If `flag` is `True`, it means there was at least one '0' followed by a '1'. In this case, the final count is decremented by 1.

3. **Output**:
   - The final count is printed for each test case.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with the provided examples and some additional edge cases.

#### Provided Examples:
1. **Input**: `11010`
   - **Output**: `3`
   - **Explanation**: Cuts at positions 2 and 3 give pieces `11`, `0`, `1`, `0`. Rearrange to `00111`.

2. **Input**: `00000000`
   - **Output**: `1`
   - **Explanation**: Already sorted, no cuts needed.

3. **Input**: `1`
   - **Output**: `1`
   - **Explanation**: Single character, no cuts needed.

4. **Input**: `10`
   - **Output**: `2`
   - **Explanation**: Cut at position 1 gives pieces `1`, `0`. Rearrange to `01`.

5. **Input**: `0001111`
   - **Output**: `1`
   - **Explanation**: Already sorted, no cuts needed.

6. **Input**: `0110`
   - **Output**: `2`
   - **Explanation**: Cut at position 1 gives pieces `0`, `110`. Rearrange to `0011`.

#### Additional Edge Cases:
1. **Input**: `010101`
   - **Output**: `3`
   - **Explanation**: Cuts at positions 1 and 3 give pieces `0`, `1`, `0`, `1`, `0`, `1`. Rearrange to `000111`.

2. **Input**: `1001`
   - **Output**: `3`
   - **Explanation**: Cuts at positions 1 and 2 give pieces `1`, `00`, `1`. Rearrange to `0011`.

3. **Input**: `001001`
   - **Output**: `3`
   - **Explanation**: Cuts at positions 2 and 4 give pieces `00`, `1`, `00`, `1`. Rearrange to `000011`.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the provided program and testing it with various inputs, including the provided examples and additional edge cases, the program seems to correctly compute the minimum number of pieces needed for each test case.

Therefore, the program appears to meet the requirements of the problem description.

**Correctness: True**

The program handles transitions between '0' and '1' correctly and adjusts the count accordingly. It also correctly identifies when no cuts are needed if the string is already sorted.
