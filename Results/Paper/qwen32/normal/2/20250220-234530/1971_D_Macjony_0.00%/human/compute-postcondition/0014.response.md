Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is the input string with length greater than 1; if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[j + 1]`, then `count` is 2 and `flag` is True if `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False, and `j` is 2 if `flag` is True, otherwise `j` remains 1; if `s[j]` is equal to `s[j + 1]`, then `count` remains 1, `flag` remains False, and `j` is 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `j` is incremented by 1. If `flag` was True (meaning `s[j]` was '0' and `s[j + 1]` was '1'), `j` becomes 2. Otherwise, `j` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
