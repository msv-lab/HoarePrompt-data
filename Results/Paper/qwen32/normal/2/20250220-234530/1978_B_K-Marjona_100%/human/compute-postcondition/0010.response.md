Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input; `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a` if `b` is greater than `a`, otherwise `k` is the minimum of `n` and 0.**

Natural Language: The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The variable `k` is updated to be the minimum of `n` and `b - a` if `b` is greater than `a`. If `b` is not greater than `a`, then `k` is updated to be the minimum of `n` and 0.
