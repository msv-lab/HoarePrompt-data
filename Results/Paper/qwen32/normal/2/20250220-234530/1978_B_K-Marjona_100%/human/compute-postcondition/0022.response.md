Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it computes and prints a specific value based on these integers. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `a` multiplied by `n`. Otherwise, it calculates a more complex expression involving `n`, `a`, and `b` and prints the result.**
