You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
Bob has `n` buns to sell. He can sell the first `k` buns at a modified price `(b - i + 1)` coins for the `i-th` bun, and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a` coins each. We need to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by choosing the optimal `k`.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it calculates the maximum profit using the following logic:
- If `b <= a`, it means the modified price is not beneficial, so Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a`.
- Otherwise, it calculates the optimal `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. It then computes the total profit by summing up the prices of the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a`.

### Key Points to Verify
1. **Handling of `b <= a`:** If the modified price is not beneficial (`b <= a`), the program correctly returns `a * n`.
2. **Calculation of `k`:** The program sets `k = min(n, b - a)`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` or the maximum possible value of `b - a`.
3. **Profit Calculation:** The profit from the first `k` buns is calculated as `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`, which is the sum of an arithmetic series. The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns is `(n - k) * a`.

### Edge Cases to Consider
- **Small Values:** Test with small values of `n`, `a`, and `b` to ensure the basic logic works.
- **Large Values:** Test with large values of `n`, `a`, and `b` to ensure the program handles large inputs efficiently.
- **Boundary Conditions:** Test cases where `b <= a`, `k = 0`, and `k = n`.
