The code `elements = line.split()` splits the string stored in `line` into a list of substrings based on whitespace. This means that `elements` will now hold these substrings.

Output State: **`line` is the seventh line of the input, `elements` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the seventh line by whitespace.**
