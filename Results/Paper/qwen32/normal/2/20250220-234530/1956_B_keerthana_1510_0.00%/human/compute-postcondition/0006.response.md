Let's analyze the given for loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop is defined as follows:
```python
for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means the loop iterates over every second line starting from the third line (index 2) of the input file (or standard input).

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `line` is the fifth line of the input.
- `elements` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `line`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop progresses. The loop variable `line` takes every second line starting from the third line. Since the current `line` is the fifth line, the next `line` should be the seventh line.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop starts with the third line (`[*open(0)][2]`).
2. The next iteration would take the fifth line (`[*open(0)][4]`), which matches our current state.
3. For the next iteration, `line` should be the seventh line (`[*open(0)][6]`).

Since `elements` is derived from `line` by splitting it, the state of `elements` will change accordingly based on the content of the seventh line.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`line` is the seventh line of the input, `elements` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the seventh line**.
