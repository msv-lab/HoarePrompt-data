#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), representing the number of cards each player receives. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), representing the integers on the cards in your hand. Each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n at most 2 times. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
        elements = line.split()
        
        print(sum(elements.count(item) // 3 for item in {*elements}))
        
    #State: 0 0 0 ... (as many 0s as there are lines processed by the loop)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes a number of cards and a list of integers representing the values on those cards. It calculates and prints the total count of integers that appear at least three times across all cards for each test case.
