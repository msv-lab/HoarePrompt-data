### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game involving coins arranged in a circle. The key insight is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins ("U").

- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function correctly reads the input from standard input. It processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. It returns a list of tuples, each containing the integer `n` and the string `s`. This part of the code is correct as per the problem statement.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function determines the winner based on the number of "U" characters in the string `s`. It counts the number of "U" characters and checks if this count is odd. If the count is odd, Alice wins (returns 'YES'), otherwise Bob wins (returns 'NO'). This logic aligns with the problem's requirement that the game's outcome is determined by whether the number of facing-up coins is odd or even.

The correctness of the entire program hinges on the correctness of these two functions working together. Since both functions accurately implement the required logic, the overall program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
