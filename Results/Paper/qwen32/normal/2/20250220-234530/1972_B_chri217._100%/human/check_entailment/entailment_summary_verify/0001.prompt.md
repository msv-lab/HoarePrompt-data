You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program:
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
        cases.append((n, s))
    return cases

#Function 2:
def func_2(case):
    ups = sum((1 for c in case[1] if c == 'U'))
    return 'YES' if ups % 2 else 'NO'



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function takes a tuple `case` as input, where the first element is an integer `n` representing the number of coins, and the second element is a string of length `n` consisting of "U" and "D". It returns 'YES' if the number of "U" characters in the string is odd, otherwise it returns 'NO'.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
- The game involves `n` coins arranged in a circle.
- Each coin can be either facing up ('U') or facing down ('D').
- Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the two adjacent coins.
- The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins.
- The player who cannot make a move loses.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Game Termination**: The game will always terminate because each move reduces the number of facing-up coins by at least one.
2. **Winning Strategy**: The outcome of the game depends on the initial number of facing-up coins (`ups`).
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always win if both players play optimally.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will always win if both players play optimally.

This is because:
- If `ups` is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position where he faces an even number of facing-up coins, ensuring Alice wins.
- If `ups` is even, Bob can always force Alice into a position where she faces an odd number of facing-up coins, ensuring Bob wins.

#### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution consists of two functions:
1. **func_1()**: Reads the input and returns a list of test cases.
2. **func_2(case)**: Determines the winner based on the number of facing-up coins in a given test case.

**Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
- Reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the coins.
- Appends a tuple `(n, s)` to the list `cases`.
- Returns the list of test cases.

**Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
- Takes a test case `(n, s)`.
- Counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s`.
- Returns 'YES' if the count of 'U' is odd, otherwise returns 'NO'.

#### Verification:
- The logic in `func_2` correctly implements the winning strategy based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.
- The input reading and processing in `func_1` are consistent with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the optimal play from both players.
