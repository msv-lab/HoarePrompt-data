### Reasoning:

The problem revolves around determining the winner of a game involving coins arranged in a circle. The key observation here is that the outcome of the game depends solely on the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins ('U') at the start of the game.

#### Key Points:
1. **Game Mechanics**: Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins. The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins.
2. **Optimal Play**: Both players play optimally, meaning they make moves that maximize their chances of winning.
3. **Winning Condition**: The player who makes the last move (i.e., removes the last facing-up coin) wins the game.

#### Analysis:
- If the initial number of facing-up coins (`ups`) is **odd**, Alice (who starts first) can always force Bob into a position where he faces an even number of facing-up coins after his turn. This pattern continues until Bob is forced to face a situation with no facing-up coins left, making Alice the winner.
- Conversely, if the initial number of facing-up coins (`ups`) is **even**, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that Alice is the one left with an even number of facing-up coins and eventually no facing-up coins, making Bob the winner.

Given this understanding, the solution provided in `func_2` correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins:
```python
def func_2(case):
    ups = sum(1 for c in case[1] if c == 'U')
    return 'YES' if ups % 2 else 'NO'
```
This function counts the number of 'U's in the string representation of the coins and returns 'YES' if the count is odd (indicating Alice wins) and 'NO' if the count is even (indicating Bob wins).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the winner based on the given problem statement and examples.

**Correctness: True**
