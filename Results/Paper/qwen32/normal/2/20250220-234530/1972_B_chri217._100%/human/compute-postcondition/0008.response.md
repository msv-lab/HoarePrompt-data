The given code snippet reads a new line from the standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns the result to the variable `s`. This means the original value of `s` is overwritten by the new input.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is decreased by 1 (implying it was previously a number and now it's one less than that number).
- `n` is a positive integer read from input such that 1 <= n <= 100.
- `s` is a string read from input containing only "U" and "D".
- `cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, s)`.

After executing the code snippet, the value of `s` changes to the new string read from the input. The values of `t`, `n`, and `cases` remain unchanged because they are not modified by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is decreased by 1, `n` is the new positive integer read from input such that 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is the new string read from input containing only "U" and "D", `cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, s)`**.
