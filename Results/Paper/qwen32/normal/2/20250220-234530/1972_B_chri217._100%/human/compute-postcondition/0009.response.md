The code appends a new tuple `(n, s)` to the list `cases`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged except for `cases` which now contains an additional tuple.

Output State: **`t` is decreased by 1, `n` is the new positive integer read from input such that 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is the new string read from input containing only "U" and "D", `cases` is a list containing two tuples, the first being the original tuple and the second being `(n, s)`**.
