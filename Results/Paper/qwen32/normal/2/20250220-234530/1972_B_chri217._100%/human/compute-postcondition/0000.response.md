The given code snippet calculates the number of coins that are facing up ("U") in the string contained within the tuple `case`. The variable `ups` is assigned the count of "U" characters in `case[1]`.

Output State: **`case` is a tuple where the first element is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second element is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D"; `ups` is the count of "U" in `case[1]`.**
