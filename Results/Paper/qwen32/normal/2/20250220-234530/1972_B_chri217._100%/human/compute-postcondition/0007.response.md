The given code snippet reads a new positive integer `n` from the input, which overwrites the existing value of `n`. The other variables `t`, `s`, and `cases` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is decreased by 1, `n` is the new positive integer read from input such that 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is the string read from input containing only "U" and "D", `cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, s)`**. 

Natural Language: The value of `n` has been updated to a new positive integer read from the input, while `t`, `s`, and `cases` retain their previous values.
