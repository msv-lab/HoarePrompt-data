Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads input values for the number of test cases `t`, the number of coins `n` for each test case, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of "U" and "D". It returns a list `cases` containing `t` tuples, where each tuple consists of the last positive integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and the last string `s` (containing only "U" and "D") read from the input.**
