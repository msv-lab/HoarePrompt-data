### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in the functions `func_1` and `func_2` aligns with the problem description.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function reads the input from standard input.
- It correctly parses the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the number of coins (`n`) and the string representing the state of the coins (`s`).
- It stores these values in a list of tuples `cases`, where each tuple contains `(n, s)`.
- This part of the program works as expected and correctly processes the input.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function takes a single test case (a tuple `(n, s)`) and determines the winner of the game.
- It counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s` using a generator expression inside the `sum` function.
- It returns 'YES' if the count of 'U' is odd, and 'NO' if the count is even.
- According to the problem statement, the game can be reduced to counting the number of facing-up coins ('U'). If the number of 'U' is odd, Alice will win; otherwise, Bob will win. This is because each move reduces the number of 'U' by 1, and the player who makes the last move (when there is an odd number of 'U') wins.

Given the above analysis, the logic in `func_2` correctly implements the winning condition based on the parity of the number of 'U' characters.

### Conclusion:
Both functions work correctly according to the problem description. Therefore, the overall program is correct.

### Your response:
Reasoning: The program correctly reads the input and determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins ('U').
Correctness: **True**
