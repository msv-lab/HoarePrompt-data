The code snippet `pl.append(i)` adds the current element `i` from `palka` to the list `pl`. This operation modifies the list `pl` by appending the new element.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `pl` because `i` is appended to it. All other variables retain their initial state unless they are directly impacted by this operation, which they are not in this case.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one element, `w` is the length of `palka` minus 1, `pl` is a list that now contains the element `i`, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is either `1` (if `i` was not previously in `d`) or incremented by `1` (if `i` was already in `d`), `shapes` is the number of unique elements in the previous `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`, `ln` is an input integer, `i` is the next element in `palka`. If `d[i]` was initially `None`, then `d[i]` is set to `1`. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by `1`.**
