The code snippet `d[i] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1. Given that `d.get(i)` is not `None`, it means that `i` is already a key in the dictionary `d` with some integer value.

Output State: **`palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one element, `w` is the length of `palka` minus 1, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary except that `d[i]` is incremented by 1, `shapes` is the number of unique elements in the previous `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`, `ln` is an input integer.**

In natural language: The value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
