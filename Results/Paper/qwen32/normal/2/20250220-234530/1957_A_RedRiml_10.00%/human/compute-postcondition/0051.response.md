Postcondition: **`shapes` is the total number of unique elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`. `w` is incremented by 1. `ln` is an input integer. `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element. `pl` is an empty list. `d` is a dictionary with `i` as a key. If `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, `d` becomes `{i: 1}`. If `d.get(i)` was not `None`, `shapes` is 0 and `d` is updated to have `i` as a key with value 1.**
