The given code reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts those components to integers, and stores them in a list named `palka`. The initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are already defined, and `w` and `ln` are also defined with certain conditions. However, the code does not affect `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, or `ln`. It only introduces a new list `palka`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` must be greater than 0; `ln` is an integer read from the input; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input.**
