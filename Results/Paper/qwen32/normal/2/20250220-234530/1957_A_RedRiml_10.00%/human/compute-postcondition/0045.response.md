The given code snippet initializes an empty dictionary `d`. This action does not affect the values of `shapes`, `w`, `ln`, `palka`, or `pl` directly. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`shapes` is the total number of unique elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`; `w` is incremented by 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `pl` is an empty list; `d` is an empty dictionary.**
