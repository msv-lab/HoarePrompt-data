The code snippet `pl.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `pl`. This affects the `pl` list by adding `i` as its new last element. The `shapes` variable is dependent on the counts of elements in `pl` within the dictionary `d`. Since `i` is added to `pl`, the count of `i` in `d` may affect `shapes` if it reaches 3 or more. However, the exact value of `shapes` cannot be determined without knowing the current counts of elements in `d`.

Other variables (`w`, `ln`, `palka`, and `i`) remain unchanged by this line of code.

Output State: **`shapes` is the total number of unique elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d` (updated if `i`'s count became 3 or more); `w` is incremented by 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element; `i` is the next element in `palka` after the current `i`; `pl` now includes `i` as its last element.**
