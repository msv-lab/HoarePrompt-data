The code snippet `d[i] += 1` increments the count of the element `i` in the dictionary `d`. If `i` was not previously in `d`, it will be added with a count of 1. If `i` was already in `d`, its count will be incremented by 1.

Given the initial state, the value of `d[i]` changes as follows:
- If `i` was not in `d`, `d[i]` becomes `1`.
- If `i` was already in `d`, `d[i]` becomes `d[i] + 1`.

The values of other variables (`palka`, `w`, `pl`, `shapes`, `ln`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one element, `w` is the length of `palka` minus 1, `pl` is a list that may or may not contain the element `i`, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is incremented by 1, `shapes` is the number of unique elements in the previous `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`, `ln` is an input integer, `i` is the next element in `palka`.**
