Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `palka` is the original list of integers, `w` is the length of `palka` minus 1, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared, `d` is a dictionary with counts of each element in `palka`, `shapes` is 0, and `ln` is the original input integer.
Code of the loop:
for j in pl:
    if d[j] >= 3:
        shapes += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `palka` is the original list of integers that must have at least one element, `w` is the length of `palka` minus 1, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least one element, `d` is a dictionary with counts of each element in `palka`. If the current element `j` in `d` has a count of at least 3, `shapes` is 1; otherwise, `shapes` remains 0. `ln` is the original input integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `palka` is the original list of integers that must have at least one element, `w` is the length of `palka` minus 1, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least one element, `d` is a dictionary with counts of each element in `palka`. If the current element `j` in `d` has a count of at least 3, `shapes` is 1; otherwise, `shapes` remains 0. `ln` is the original input integer, `j` is the next element in `pl` after the current `j`. If the count of `j` in `d` is at least 3, `shapes` is set to 1; otherwise, `shapes` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `palka` is the original list of integers that must have at least one element, `w` is the length of `palka` minus 1, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least one element, `d` is a dictionary with counts of each element in `palka`, `ln` is the original input integer, `j` is the next element in `pl` after the current `j`. If the count of `j` in `d` is at least 3, `shapes` is set to 1; otherwise, `shapes` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
