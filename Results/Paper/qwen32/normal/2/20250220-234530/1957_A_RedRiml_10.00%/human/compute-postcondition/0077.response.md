The code increments the value of `shapes` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `shapes` was either 1 or 2. After the increment, `shapes` will be either 2 or 3.

Output State: **`w` is the length of `palka`, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` that must have at least 3 elements, `d` is a dictionary with counts of each element in `palka`. If there exists an element `j` in `d` such that the count of `j` in `d` is greater than or equal to 3, then `shapes` is 2. Otherwise, `shapes` remains 1. `j` is the third element of `pl`. `shapes` is either 2 or 3.**
