You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of k distinct integers where 1 <= k <= 100, and each element in a satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 100 with a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k. b is a list of q integers where 1 <= q <= 100, and each element in b satisfies 1 <= n_i <= 100.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a <= b) :
        return a - 1
        #The program returns a list where each element is 1 less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`.
    else :
        return b
        #The program returns list `b` which contains `q` integers where each integer satisfies 1 <= n_i <= 100.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a`, a list of `k` distinct integers sorted in ascending order where each integer is between 1 and 100, and `b`, a list of `q` integers where each integer is between 1 and 100. The function returns a list where each element is 1 less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`. If the conditions for `a` are met but not specified for `b`, the function still returns the modified list `a`. If the conditions for `a` are not met, the behavior is unspecified based on the given information. However, based on the provided cases, if the conditions for `a` are satisfied, it returns the modified list `a`; otherwise, it returns list `b`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns a list where each element is 1 less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`.

Case_2: The program returns list `b` which contains `q` integers where each integer satisfies 1 <= n_i <= 100.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
