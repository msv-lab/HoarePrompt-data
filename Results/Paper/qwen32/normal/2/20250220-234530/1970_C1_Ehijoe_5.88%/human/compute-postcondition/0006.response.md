The code appends the value of `u` to the `tree` deque. This means that `tree` is no longer empty, and `empty` should be set to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the second integer read from the input, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, `u_1` is an integer (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n), `tree` is a deque containing the integer `u`, `empty` is False, `u` and `v` are integers read from the input.**
