The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. The initial state specifies that `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, but their specific values are not provided. After executing the code, the values of `u` and `v` will be set to whatever integers are provided in the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the second integer read from the input, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, `u_1` is an integer (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n), `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, `empty` is False, `i` is 5, and `u` and `v` are the integers obtained from the latest input.**
