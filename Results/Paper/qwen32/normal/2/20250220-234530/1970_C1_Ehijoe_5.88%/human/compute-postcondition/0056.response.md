The code snippet `idx = tree.index(start)` finds the index of the integer `start` within the deque `tree`. This operation does not change the values of `n`, `t`, `tree`, `empty`, or `start`. It only introduces a new variable `idx` which holds the index of `start` in `tree`.

Given that `start` is an integer read from the input and `tree` is a deque representing the path of the tree from one leaf to the other, `idx` will be the position of `start` in this path.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the second integer read from the input, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, `u_1` is an integer (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n), `tree` is a deque representing the entire path of the tree from one leaf to the other, `empty` is False, `start` is an integer read from the input, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`.**
