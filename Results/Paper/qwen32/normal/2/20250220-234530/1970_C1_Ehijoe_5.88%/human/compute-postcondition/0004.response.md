The code reads a pair of integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. The values of `n`, `t`, `u_1`, `tree`, and `empty` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the second integer read from the input, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, `u_1` is an integer (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n), `tree` is an empty deque, `empty` is True, `u` and `v` are integers read from the input.**
