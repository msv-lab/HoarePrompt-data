Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the second integer read from the input, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, `u_1` is an integer (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n), `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, `empty` is False, and `i` is 5. If `empty` is True, `tree` now includes both the integers `u` and `v` appended to it. If `empty` is False, `tree` is modified based on the values of `u` and `v`: if `v` equals the first element of the `tree`, `u` is prepended to the `tree`; if `v` equals the last element of the `tree`, `u` is appended to the `tree`; if `u` equals the first element of the `tree`, `v` is prepended to the `tree`; if `u` equals the last element of the `tree`, `v` is appended to the `tree`.**
