The code appends the integer `u` to the left end of the `tree` deque. This means that `u` will now be the first element in the `tree` deque.

Given that `tree` was unchanged before this operation, the only change is that `u` is added to the front of `tree`. All other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the second integer read from the input, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, `u_1` is an integer (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n), `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, `empty` is False, `tree` has `u` appended to its left, `i` is 4.**
