Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the second integer read from the input, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, `u_1` is an integer (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n), `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, and `empty` is False. If `empty` was initially True, `tree` is now a deque containing the integers `u` and `v`. If `empty` was initially False, `tree` remains unchanged if `v` is neither the first nor the last element of `tree` and `u` does not match the first or last element of `tree`. If `v` is the first element of `tree`, `tree` remains unchanged. If `v` is the last element of `tree`, `tree` now contains its original elements plus `u`. If `v` is not the first or last element of `tree` and `u` equals the first element of `tree`, `tree` now has `v` as its first element. If `v` is not the first or last element of `tree` and `u` equals the last element of `tree`, `tree` now contains the previously last element of `tree` followed by `v`.**
