The code snippet provided appends the value of `v` to the left end of the list `tree`. This means that the order of elements in `tree` will change, with `v` being the new first element.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `tree`. All other variables (`n`, `t`, `u_1`, `u`, `v`, `empty`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the second integer read from the input, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, `u_1` is an integer (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n), `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, `empty` is False, `i` is 5, and `u` and `v` are the integers obtained from the latest input; `tree` has `v` appended to its left end.**
