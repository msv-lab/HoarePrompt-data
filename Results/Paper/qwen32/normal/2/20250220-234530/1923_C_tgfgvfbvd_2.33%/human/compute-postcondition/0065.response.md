Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n`: An integer obtained from the input.
   - `m`: An integer greater than 0.
   - `l`: A list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `p`: A list containing the cumulative sums starting from 1.
   - `c`: The total sum of all elements in `l` plus 1.
   - `_`: Assigned the value 1 (though this variable is not used in the provided code snippet).
   - `a` and `b`: Integers obtained from the input.
   
2. **Conditional Logic:**
   - If `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`; otherwise, `s` remains `p[b - 1]`.
   - It is also mentioned that `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 and `s` is at least twice the value of `b - a + 1`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The provided code snippet contains only one print statement: `print('YES')`.

### Analysis:

- The print statement `print('YES')` does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, or `s`. 
- It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:

Given that the print statement is independent of the values of the variables and conditions described in the initial state, the output will always be `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
