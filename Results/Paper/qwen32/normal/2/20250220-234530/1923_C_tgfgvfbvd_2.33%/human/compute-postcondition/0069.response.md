The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is used as a counter for the loop iterations. According to the for loop statement, `_` ranges from 0 to `m-1`. At the end of each iteration, `_` is incremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer obtained from the input
- `m` is an integer greater than 0
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums starting from 1
- `c` is the total sum of all elements in `l` plus 1
- `_` is 1
- `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input
- `s` is calculated based on the values of `a` and `b` and the list `p`

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
- The variable `_` needs to be incremented by 1 since it is the loop counter.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from the input, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums starting from 1, `c` is the total sum of all elements in `l` plus 1, `_` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input, `s` is calculated based on the values of `a` and `b` and the list `p`**
