You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and q are integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5; c is a list of n integers where each element is greater than 0 and 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; for each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = []
        
        c = 0
        
        for x in l:
            c += x
            p.append(c)
        
        for _ in range(m):
            a, b = map(int, input().split())
            s = p[b - 1]
            if a - 2 >= 0:
                s -= p[a - 2]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: t is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); the loop has executed `t` times, with each execution involving reading `n` and `m`, a list `l` of `n` integers, computing cumulative sums into list `p`, and processing `m` queries. Each query involves reading `a` and `b`, computing `s` as the sum of elements from index `a-1` to `b-1` in `l`, and printing 'YES' if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, otherwise 'NO'. The variables `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, and `c` are reset for each test case, while `_` in the outer loop is decremented until it reaches 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `q`, a list `c` of `n` positive integers, and `q` queries. Each query consists of two integers `l_i` and `r_i`. The function processes each query and returns the result for each query. Specifically, for each query, the function calculates and returns the sum of the elements in the list `c` from index `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive).

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
