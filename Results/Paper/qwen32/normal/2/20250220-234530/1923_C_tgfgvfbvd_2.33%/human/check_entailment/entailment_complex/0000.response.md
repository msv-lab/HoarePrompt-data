### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem requirements and the logic implemented in the program to see if they align correctly.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **Sum Condition**: The sum of the subarray should be equal to the sum of another array `b` of the same length, where `b_i > 0` for all `i`.
2. **Distinct Elements Condition**: Every element in the subarray `a` should be different from the corresponding element in `b`.
3. **Positive Elements Condition**: All elements in `b` must be positive.

#### Program Logic:
The program calculates the prefix sums of the array `c` and uses these to quickly compute the sum of any subarray defined by indices `l_i` and `r_i`. For each query, it checks if the sum of the subarray is at least twice the number of elements in the subarray and if the subarray contains more than one element. If both conditions are met, it prints "YES", otherwise "NO".

#### Analysis:
- **Sum Condition**: The program does not explicitly construct the array `b`. Instead, it checks if the sum of the subarray is at least twice the number of elements in the subarray. This condition indirectly ensures that we can construct an array `b` where each element is at least 1 and different from the corresponding element in `a` (since the sum of `b` would be at least the sum of `a` and the difference would be distributed among the elements).
- **Distinct Elements Condition**: The condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` ensures that the sum of the subarray is large enough to accommodate a new array `b` where each element is at least 1 and different from the corresponding element in `a`. This is because if the sum of the subarray is at least twice the number of elements, we can always find a way to distribute the values to make `b_i > 0` and `a_i != b_i`.
- **Positive Elements Condition**: The array `b` is implicitly constructed to have positive elements because the sum of `b` must be at least the sum of `a` and the difference is distributed among the elements to ensure they are positive.

Given these points, the program correctly determines whether a subarray is "good" according to the problem's definition.

### Conclusion:
The program implements the logic correctly based on the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
