The given code snippet modifies the variable `s` by subtracting `p[a - 2]` from its current value. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is the first integer obtained from the input
- `m` is the second integer obtained from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums after each element of `l` has been added
- `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`
- `_` is 1
- `a` and `b` are the two integers obtained from the latest input
- `s` is `p[b - 1]`
- Additionally, `a` is an integer such that `a - 2 >= 0`

The code snippet:
```python
s -= p[a - 2]
```

This modifies `s` to be `s - p[a - 2]`.

Thus, the updated value of `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer obtained from the input; `m` is the second integer obtained from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums after each element of `l` has been added; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `_` is 1; `a` and `b` are the two integers obtained from the latest input; `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.**
