The code snippet provided assigns the value of `p[b - 1]` to the variable `s`. This means that the previous value of `s` is overwritten by the new value `p[b - 1]`.

Given the initial conditions, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `_`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The only change is the value of `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from the input, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums starting from 1, `c` is the total sum of all elements in `l` plus 1, `_` is 3, `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input, and `s` is `p[b - 1]`.**
