The code snippet `s -= p[a - 2]` modifies the value of `s` by subtracting the element at index `a - 2` of the list `p` from it. 

Given the initial state, `s` is initially set to `p[b - 1]`. After the operation, `s` will be updated to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from the input, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums starting from 1, `c` is the total sum of all elements in `l` plus 1, `_` is 3, `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input, and `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.**
