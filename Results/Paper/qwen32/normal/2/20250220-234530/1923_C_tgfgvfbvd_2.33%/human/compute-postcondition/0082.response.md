The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. This output does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `_`, `a`, `b`, or `s` described in the initial state. The `print` statement is straightforward and simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
2. The variable `n` is an integer obtained from the input.
3. The variable `m` is an integer greater than 0.
4. The variable `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
5. The variable `p` is a list containing cumulative sums starting from 1.
6. The variable `c` is the total sum of all elements in `l` plus 1.
7. The variable `_` is assigned the value 3.
8. The variables `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input.
9. The variable `s` is calculated based on the condition `if a - 2 >= 0`, but this calculation does not affect the `print` statement.

Given these details, the `print` statement is independent of the values of these variables and directly outputs `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
