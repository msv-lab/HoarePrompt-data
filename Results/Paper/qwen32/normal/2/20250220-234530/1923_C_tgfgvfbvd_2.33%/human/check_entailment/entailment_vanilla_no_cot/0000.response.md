Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to determine if a subarray `c[l..r]` is "good".
- A subarray is "good" if there exists another array `b` of the same length where:
  1. The sum of elements in `c[l..r]` equals the sum of elements in `b`.
  2. No element in `c[l..r]` is equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
  3. All elements in `b` are greater than 0.

### Key Observations:
- Condition 1 implies that the sum of `b` must be equal to the sum of `c[l..r]`.
- Condition 2 implies that `b[i] != c[i]` for all `i` in the subarray.
- Condition 3 implies that `b[i] > 0` for all `i`.

### Conditions for a Subarray to be "Good":
- If the sum of the subarray `c[l..r]` is `S`, then for `b` to exist with the properties mentioned above, `S` must be at least `2 * (r - l + 1)`. This is because we need to construct `b` such that each `b[i]` is different from `c[i]` and positive. The smallest possible values for `b[i]` would be `1` if `c[i] != 1`, or `2` if `c[i] == 1`. Therefore, the minimum sum of `b` would be `2 * (r - l + 1)`.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
- The program calculates prefix sums of the array `c` to efficiently compute the sum of any subarray `c[l..r]`.
- For each query, it computes the sum of the subarray using the prefix sums.
- It then checks if the sum of the subarray is at least `2 * (r - l + 1)`. If so, it prints "YES", otherwise "NO".

### Conclusion:
The logic used in the program is correct. If the sum of the subarray is at least twice its length, it is possible to construct such an array `b` that satisfies all the conditions. Hence, the program correctly determines whether each subarray is "good".

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
