Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine if a subarray `c[l_i:r_i]` of the array `c` is "good". A subarray is considered "good" if:
1. There exists another array `b` of the same length such that the sum of elements in `b` equals the sum of elements in the subarray.
2. Every element in `b` is strictly greater than 0.
3. No element in `b` is equal to the corresponding element in the subarray.

### Key Observations:
- To satisfy condition 1, the sum of the subarray must be even because we need to split it into two equal parts (the subarray itself and `b`).
- To satisfy condition 2, since every element in `b` must be positive, the smallest possible value for each element in `b` is 1. This means the sum of `b` must be at least the length of the subarray.
- To satisfy condition 3, no element in `b` can be equal to the corresponding element in the subarray, which means that if the subarray has only one element, it cannot be "good" unless the element is greater than 1 (since `b` would need to have a different value).

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution calculates the prefix sums of the array `c` and uses these to quickly compute the sum of any subarray. It then checks if the sum of the subarray is even and greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray. If both conditions are met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

#### Issues in the Solution:
1. **Single Element Subarrays**: The solution does not handle the case where the subarray has only one element correctly. If the subarray has only one element, it should check if the element is greater than 1 to be "good".
2. **Sum Check**: The condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` is necessary but not sufficient. While it ensures that the sum can be split into two parts and that each part can have values greater than 0, it does not guarantee that the two parts can be formed without violating condition 3 (no element in `b` can be equal to the corresponding element in the subarray).

### Conclusion:
The solution does not correctly handle all cases, particularly single-element subarrays and does not fully ensure that condition 3 is satisfied. Therefore, the solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
