You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = []
        c = 0
        for x in l:
            c += x
            p.append(c)
        for _ in range(m):
            (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
            s = p[b - 1]
            if a - 2 >= 0:
                s -= p[a - 2]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and `q`, a list `c` of `n` positive integers, and `q` queries. Each query consists of two integers `l_i` and `r_i`. The function calculates the sum of the elements in the list `c` from index `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive) and prints 'YES' if the sum is at least twice the number of elements in the queried range and the range contains more than one element; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine if a subarray `c[l_i:r_i]` of the array `c` is "good". A subarray is considered "good" if:
1. There exists another array `b` of the same length such that the sum of elements in `b` equals the sum of elements in the subarray.
2. Every element in `b` is strictly greater than 0.
3. No element in `b` is equal to the corresponding element in the subarray.

### Key Observations:
- To satisfy condition 1, the sum of the subarray must be even because we need to split it into two equal parts (the subarray itself and `b`).
- To satisfy condition 2, since every element in `b` must be positive, the smallest possible value for each element in `b` is 1. This means the sum of `b` must be at least the length of the subarray.
- To satisfy condition 3, no element in `b` can be equal to the corresponding element in the subarray, which means that if the subarray has only one element, it cannot be "good" unless the element is greater than 1 (since `b` would need to have a different value).

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution calculates the prefix sums of the array `c` and uses these to quickly compute the sum of any subarray. It then checks if the sum of the subarray is even and greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray. If both conditions are met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

#### Issues in the Solution:
1. **Single Element Subarrays**: The solution does not handle the case where the subarray has only one element correctly. If the subarray has only one element, it should check if the element is greater than 1 to be "good".
2. **Sum Check**: The condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` is necessary but not sufficient. While it ensures that the sum can be split into two parts and that each part can have values greater than 0, it does not guarantee that the two parts can be formed without violating condition 3 (no element in `b` can be equal to the corresponding element in the subarray).

### Conclusion:
The solution does not correctly handle all cases, particularly single-element subarrays and does not fully ensure that condition 3 is satisfied. Therefore, the solution is incorrect.
