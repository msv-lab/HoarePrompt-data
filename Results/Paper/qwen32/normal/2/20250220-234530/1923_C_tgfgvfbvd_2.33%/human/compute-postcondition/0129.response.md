Output State: **t is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); the loop has executed `t` times, with each execution involving reading `n` and `m`, a list `l` of `n` integers, computing cumulative sums into list `p`, and processing `m` queries. Each query involves reading `a` and `b`, computing `s` as the sum of elements from index `a-1` to `b-1` in `l`, and printing 'YES' if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, otherwise 'NO'. The variables `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, and `c` are reset for each test case, while `_` in the outer loop is decremented until it reaches 0.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the program will have processed `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `m`, followed by a list of `n` integers. It then computes the cumulative sums of these integers and processes each of the `m` queries to determine if the specified subarray meets the given condition, printing 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. The variables `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, and `c` are reinitialized for each test case, and the loop counter `_` is decremented until all test cases are processed.
