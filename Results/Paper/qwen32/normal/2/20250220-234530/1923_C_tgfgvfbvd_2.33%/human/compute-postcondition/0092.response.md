The given code snippet is `c += x`. However, there is no variable `x` defined in the initial state. This would typically result in a `NameError` during execution because `x` is not recognized. Since the task specifies to adhere to the given format and assume all variables used are defined, let's assume `x` was intended to be another variable present in the initial state or a typo, and proceed with the assumption that `x` is a variable that holds some integer value.

Given the initial state and assuming `x` is an integer (since its value isn't specified, we'll just denote the operation):

- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` remains the first integer obtained from the input.
- `m` remains the second integer obtained from the input.
- `l` remains a list of integers obtained from the new input and must contain at least one element.
- `p` remains an empty list.
- `c` is incremented by the value of `x`.
- `_` remains 1.

Since the exact value of `x` is not provided, we denote the new value of `c` as `c + x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer obtained from the input; `m` is the second integer obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must contain at least one element; `p` is an empty list; `c` is `c + x`; `_` is 1.**
