Given the initial state described, let's break down the relevant parts to determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `n` and `m` are integers where `m` is at least 1.
- `l` is a list of integers.
- `p` is a list of cumulative sums derived from `l`.
- `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
- `_` is set to 1.
- `a` and `b` are integers with the condition `b - a + 1 > 1` holding true.
- `s` is at least twice the value of `b - a + 1`.

The `print('YES')` statement does not depend on any of these variables directly. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not require any computation or reference to the variables described in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
