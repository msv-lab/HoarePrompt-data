The code snippet provided updates the values of `n` and `m` by reading two integers from the input. The initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, but their specific values are not given. After executing the code, `n` and `m` will be assigned the new values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer obtained from the input; `m` is the second integer obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums starting from 1; `c` is the total sum of all elements in `l` plus 1; `_` is 1**.
