Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` remains greater than 0, For each test case, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `a` remains a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, `numInteger` is the input integer, `numbers` becomes a sorted list of strings from the input in ascending order, `suma` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language: The variable `suma` has been reset to 0. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
