You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        numbers = input().split()
        numbers.sort(reverse=False)
        suma = 0
        while numbers != []:
            a = int(numbers.pop(0))
            b = int(numbers.pop(0))
            suma += min(a, b)
        print(suma)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. It calculates the sum of the minimum values of `n` pairs formed from the list of integers for each test case and prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:
To solve this problem optimally, we need to maximize the sum of the minimum values obtained from pairs of numbers. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Sorting**: The key insight is to sort the numbers in ascending order. This ensures that when we pair the smallest numbers together, we are maximizing the contribution of the smaller number in each pair to the total score.

2. **Pairing Strategy**: After sorting, we can simply take the numbers two at a time from the beginning of the sorted list. Since the list is sorted in ascending order, the first number in each pair will always be the smaller one, thus maximizing the sum of the minimums.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read the number of integers `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   - Sort the list of integers in non-decreasing order.
   - Initialize a variable `suma` to keep track of the total score.
   - Iterate through the sorted list, taking two numbers at a time, adding the smaller one (which is the first in the sorted list) to `suma`.
   - Print the final score for each test case.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the number of integers and the list of integers.
- It sorts the list of integers in non-decreasing order (`numbers.sort(reverse=False)`).
- It initializes `suma` to 0.
- It uses a while loop to repeatedly pop the first two elements from the sorted list, adds the smaller one (which is the first popped element due to the sort) to `suma`, and continues until the list is empty.
- Finally, it prints the computed `suma` for each test case.

Given these steps, the program correctly implements the optimal strategy for solving the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct.
