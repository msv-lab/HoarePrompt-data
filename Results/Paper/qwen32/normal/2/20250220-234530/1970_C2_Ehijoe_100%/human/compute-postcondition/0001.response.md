The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `edges`. This action does not affect the values of `nodes`, `start`, `n`, or `t`.

Output State: **`nodes` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing neighboring nodes; `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game, such that 1 <= start <= n; `n` is the first integer read from the input; `t` is the second integer read from the input; `edges` is an empty list.**
