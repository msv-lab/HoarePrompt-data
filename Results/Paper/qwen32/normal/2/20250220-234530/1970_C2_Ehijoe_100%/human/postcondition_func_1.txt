The function reads input values representing a graph and a starting node, constructs an adjacency list for the graph, identifies leaf nodes, and determines the winner of a game based on the result of a traversal or analysis starting from the given node. It prints "Ron" if the result indicates a win for Ron, otherwise it prints "Hermione".
