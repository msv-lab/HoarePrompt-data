Output State: **`nodes` is a `defaultdict` where each key is a node and its value is a list of its neighboring nodes; `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game, such that 1 <= start <= n; `n` is the first integer read from the input; `t` is the second integer read from the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is `True`; `leaves` is a `deque`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `leaves` as an empty `deque`. All other variables remain unchanged.
