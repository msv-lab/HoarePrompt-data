The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `t`. The initial state mentions that `nodes` is a dictionary and `start` is an integer, but these variables are not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`nodes` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing neighboring nodes; `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game, such that 1 <= start <= n; `n` is the first integer read from the input; `t` is the second integer read from the input.**
