The code snippet `soma_b += lista_B[i]` updates the value of `soma_b` by adding `lista_B[i]` to it. Given that `i` is `n - 1`, `lista_B[i]` refers to the last element of `lista_B`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`pref` is the accumulated sum of relevant elements from `lista_A` and `soma_b` is the accumulated sum of relevant elements from `lista_B` after all iterations including the current `lista_B[i]` plus `lista_B[i]`; `resultado` is the minimum of its previous value and `pref + soma_b + lista_A[n - 1]`; `n` must be greater than `k`; `i` is `n - 1`.**
