To determine the output state, we need to consider the effect of calling `func_1()` without knowing its implementation details. Since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the provided context, we can only assume that it might modify some variables or perform certain actions, but we don't know which ones.

Given the initial state:
- `numero_testes` is an integer that has been decremented by 1, meaning it was initially between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, and now it is between 0 and 10^4 - 1 inclusive.

Since `func_1()` does not affect `numero_testes` in the provided code snippet, and there are no other variables mentioned, we can only conclude that `numero_testes` remains unchanged unless `func_1()` modifies it internally (which we cannot infer from the given information).

Therefore, the output state remains:
Output State: **`numero_testes` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1 inclusive.**
