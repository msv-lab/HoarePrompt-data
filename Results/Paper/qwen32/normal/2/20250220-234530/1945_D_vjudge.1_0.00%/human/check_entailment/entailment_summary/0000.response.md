### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in `func_1` aligns with the problem description and correctly computes the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach a position no later than `m` in the queue.

#### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. **Objective**: Minimize the total cost for Kirill to reach a position no later than `m` in the queue.
2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - Direct swap cost: `a_i` if Kirill swaps directly with the person at position `i`.
   - Indirect swap cost: `b_k` for each person `k` between positions `j` and `i` when swapping with person `j`.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Input Handling**: 
  - Reads `n` (number of people in the queue excluding Kirill) and `m` (maximum allowable final position).
  - Reads lists `a` and `b` which represent the direct and indirect swap costs respectively.
  - Reverses both lists `a` and `b`. This reversal seems counterintuitive because it changes the order of processing, but it doesn't inherently make the algorithm incorrect if the logic compensates for this.

- **Logic**:
  - Initializes `soma_b` (sum of indirect costs) and `pref` (prefix sum of direct costs plus accumulated indirect costs).
  - Iterates through the first `n - m` elements (since `m` is 1-based, `n - m` gives the number of elements before the target position).
    - If the direct swap cost (`lista_A[i]`) is less than the indirect swap cost (`lista_B[i]`), it updates `pref` by adding `soma_b` and `lista_A[i]`, and resets `soma_b`.
    - Otherwise, it accumulates the indirect cost in `soma_b`.
  - After processing the first `n - m` elements, it continues to iterate through the remaining elements to find the minimum total cost (`resultado`).

- **Output**:
  - Prints the minimum total cost calculated.

#### Verification:
- The logic appears to consider both direct and indirect costs correctly.
- The reversal of lists `a` and `b` might seem unusual, but if the logic correctly accounts for this reversal, it could still produce the correct result.
- The approach ensures that Kirill reaches a position no later than `m` while minimizing the total cost.

#### Conclusion:
Based on the provided code and its execution summary, the logic seems to correctly implement the required functionality. The reversal of lists `a` and `b` does not appear to affect the correctness of the solution, as long as the logic compensates for this reversal.

### Correctness: **True**
