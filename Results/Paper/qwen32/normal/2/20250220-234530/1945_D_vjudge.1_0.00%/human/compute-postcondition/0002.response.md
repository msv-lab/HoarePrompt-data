To determine the output state, we need to consider the effect of calling `func_1()` without knowing its implementation details. Since `func_1()` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine how it modifies any variables or what it returns. Therefore, based on the provided information, we can only assume that `numero_testes` remains unchanged unless `func_1()` explicitly modifies it.

Given that there is no information about `func_1()` modifying `numero_testes` or any other variables, we assume that `numero_testes` retains its initial value.

Output State: **`numero_testes` is an integer read from the input, representing the number of test cases and expected to be between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, ensuring `numero_testes` is at least 1.**
