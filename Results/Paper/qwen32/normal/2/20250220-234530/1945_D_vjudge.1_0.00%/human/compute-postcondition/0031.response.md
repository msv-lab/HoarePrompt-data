Output State: **`pref` is the accumulated sum of relevant elements from `lista_A` and `soma_b` is the accumulated sum of relevant elements from `lista_B` after all iterations including the current `lista_B[i]`; `resultado` is the minimum of its previous value and `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`; `n` must be greater than `k`.**

Explanation: The value of `soma_b` has been updated by adding `lista_B[i]` to it. The values of `pref`, `resultado`, and the condition `n > k` remain unchanged.
