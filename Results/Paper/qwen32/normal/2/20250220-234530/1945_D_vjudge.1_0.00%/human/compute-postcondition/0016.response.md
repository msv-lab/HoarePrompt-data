Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than `k`, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `lista_A` is the reversed list of `n` integers read from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed list of integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `pref` is `pref + soma_b`.**

In simple terms, the value of `pref` has been updated by adding the value of `soma_b` to it. All other variables retain their previous values.
