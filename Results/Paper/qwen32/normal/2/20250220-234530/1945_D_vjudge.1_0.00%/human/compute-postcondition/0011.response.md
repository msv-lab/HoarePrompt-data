The given code snippet resets the variable `soma_b` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than `k`, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `lista_A` is the reversed list of `n` integers read from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed list of integers read from the input, `soma_b` is 0, `pref` is `pref + lista_A[i]`, and at the current index `i`, the value of `lista_A[i]` is less than the value of `lista_B[i]`.**
