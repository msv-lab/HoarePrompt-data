The code snippet increments `soma_b` by the value of `lista_B[i]`. Given the initial state, `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, and `lista_B` remain unchanged. The only variable that changes is `soma_b`, which now includes the additional value from `lista_B[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than `k`, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `lista_A` is the reversed list of `n` integers read from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed list of integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `soma_b` is `soma_b + lista_B[i]`**.
