You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of people in the queue besides Kirill, and k is an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill such that 1 <= k <= n. lista_A is a list of n integers where each element a_i represents the cost Kirill has to pay to swap places with the i-th person. lista_B is a list of n integers where each element b_i represents the cost Kirill has to pay to the person at position k for each k such that j < k < i when swapping positions with the j-th person.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_A.reverse()
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B.reverse()
    soma_b = 0
    pref = 0
    for i in range(n - k):
        if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:
            pref += soma_b
            pref += lista_A[i]
            soma_b = 0
        else:
            soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: `pref` is the accumulated sum of relevant elements from `lista_A` and `soma_b` is the accumulated sum of relevant elements from `lista_B` after all iterations.
    resultado = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - k, n):
        resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])
        
        soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: `pref` remains unchanged, `soma_b` is the sum of `lista_B[n - k]` to `lista_B[n - 1]`, and `resultado` is the minimum value of `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for `i` from `n - k` to `n - 1`.
    print(resultado)
    #This is printed: resultado (where resultado is the minimum value of pref + soma_b + lista_A[i] for i from n - k to n - 1)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of people in the queue besides Kirill; `k`, an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill such that 1 <= k <= n; and two lists, `lista_A` and `lista_B`, each containing `n` integers. The function calculates and returns the minimum total cost Kirill has to pay to move to a position no later than `k` in the queue, considering the costs specified in `lista_A` for direct swaps and `lista_B` for indirect swaps involving other people.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
