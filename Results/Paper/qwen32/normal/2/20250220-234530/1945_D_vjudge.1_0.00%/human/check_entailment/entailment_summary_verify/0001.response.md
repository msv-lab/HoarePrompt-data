### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided code systematically using the function summary and the problem description.

#### Problem Recap

Kirill wants to move to one of the first `m` positions in a queue of `n` people. He can swap positions with any person ahead of him, paying `a_j` coins to swap directly with person `j`, and `b_k` coins for each person `k` between `j` and his current position. The goal is to find the minimum cost for Kirill to achieve this.

#### Code Analysis

The provided solution consists of two functions: `func_1()` and `func_2()`. Here's a detailed analysis:

- **Function `func_2()`**:
  - Reads the number of test cases.
  - Calls `func_1()` for each test case.

- **Function `func_1()`**:
  - Reads `n` (number of people excluding Kirill) and `m` (maximum allowable final position of Kirill).
  - Reads the lists `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` and `b_1, b_2, ..., b_n`.
  - Reverses both `lista_A` and `lista_B`.
  - Initializes `soma_b` (sum of `b` values) and `pref` (prefix cost).
  - Iterates through the first `n - m` elements in the reversed lists:
    - If `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, it adds `pref` and `lista_A[i]` to `pref` and resets `soma_b`.
    - Otherwise, it adds `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b`.
  - Iterates through the remaining `m` elements:
    - Calculates the minimum cost by considering the current `pref` plus `soma_b` plus `lista_A[i]`.
    - Updates `soma_b` by adding `lista_B[i]`.
  - Prints the minimum cost found.

#### Issues Identified

1. **Reversing the Lists**: The primary issue is reversing the lists. The problem requires considering the original order of the lists to determine the minimum cost. Reversing the lists changes the context of the problem, making the calculations incorrect.

2. **Logic for Cost Calculation**: The logic for calculating the cost does not align with the problem's requirements. The algorithm should consider the original order of the lists and use a more systematic approach, possibly involving dynamic programming or a greedy strategy, to find the minimum cost.

#### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the original order of the lists and find the optimal sequence of swaps. A potential approach could involve:

- Using a priority queue (min-heap) to always consider the least costly swap available.
- Maintaining a running sum of `b` values to account for the cost of passing through intermediate people during swaps.

However, the provided code does not implement such a strategy. Instead, it incorrectly reverses the lists and applies a flawed logic for cost calculation.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
