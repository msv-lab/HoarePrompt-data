To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of calling `func_1()`. However, the function `func_1()` is not defined in the provided context, so we cannot determine its exact effect on the variables. Given this, we can only assume that `func_1()` might modify some variables or perform some operations, but without its definition, we cannot specify those changes.

Since `func_1()` is called but its behavior is unknown, the only thing we can confidently state is that `numero_testes` remains unchanged unless `func_1()` modifies it explicitly.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `numero_testes` retains its initial value, and no other changes are specified due to the lack of details about `func_1()`.

Output State: **`numero_testes` is an integer read from the input, representing the number of test cases and expected to be between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, ensuring `numero_testes` is at least 1.**
