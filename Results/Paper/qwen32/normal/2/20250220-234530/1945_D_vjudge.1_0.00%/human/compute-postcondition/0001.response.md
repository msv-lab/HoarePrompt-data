In the given for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate over a range defined by `numero_testes`. The loop will execute if and only if `numero_testes` is greater than or equal to 1.

Since `numero_testes` is already described as an integer read from the input and expected to be between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, no adjustment is needed for `numero_testes` itself to ensure the loop executes. However, we should ensure that `numero_testes` meets the condition of being at least 1.

State: **`numero_testes` is an integer read from the input, representing the number of test cases and expected to be between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, ensuring `numero_testes` is at least 1**
