Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the new string input by the user, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the original string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in the original string `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in the original string `s` plus 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `mini` is `100000000`, `zero` is 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0, `one` is 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '1', otherwise `one` is incremented by 1, `lst` is `[n - 1, i + 1]` if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both at least 50, otherwise `lst` remains `[n - 1]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.**
