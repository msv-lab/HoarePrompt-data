To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop processes each element in `lst` and updates the `final` list based on the condition provided.

Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `n` is an integer input by the user, at least 2.
   - `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'.
   - `s` is another string input by the user.
   - `pk` is calculated as `n // 2`.
   - `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`.
   - `o` is the count of '1's in `s`.
   - `z` is the count of '0's in `s`.
   - `mini` is the smallest absolute difference between `pk` and any index in `lst`.
   - `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`.
   - `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`.
   - `lst` contains indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `final` is an initially empty list.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `lst`.
   - For each `elem` in `lst`, it checks if the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`.
   - If the condition is met, `elem` is appended to the `final` list.

After all iterations, the `final` list will contain all elements from `lst` for which the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`.

### Output State Calculation

- **Variables Unchanged**:
  - `n`, `a`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, `i` remain unchanged.

- **Variable Changed**:
  - `final`: This list will contain all indices from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and the index is equal to `mini`.

### Final Output State

Output State: **`final` contains all indices from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.**

### Natural Language Explanation

After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `final` list will include all the indices from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` (which is `n // 2`) and the index is equal to the smallest such difference (`mini`). All other variables remain in their initial states as they are not modified within the loop.
