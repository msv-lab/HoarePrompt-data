The only variable in the loop head is `ele`, which is being iterated over the list `lst`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on adjusting `ele`.

Given:
- `lst` is a list of indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50% and has at least one element.
- `j` is an index used to access elements in `lst`.
- `ele` is `lst[j + 1]`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ele` was `lst[j + 1]`. For the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1, making `ele` equal to `lst[j + 2]`.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is an integer input by the user and is at least 2; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the string input by the user such that there exists at least one index where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `mini` is the minimum of `100000000` and `abs(pk - ele)`; `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`; `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`; `lst` is a list of indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50% and has at least one element; `i` is `n - 2`; `ele` is `lst[j + 2]`**
