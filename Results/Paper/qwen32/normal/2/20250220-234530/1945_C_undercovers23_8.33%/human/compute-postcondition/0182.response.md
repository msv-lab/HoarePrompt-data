The given code snippet updates the variable `mini` by comparing its current value with the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. Since `ele` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can express the new value of `mini` in terms of `ele`.

Given that `mini` was initially set to `100000000`, the new value of `mini` will be the smaller of `100000000` and `abs(pk - ele)`.

Output State: **`n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the new string input by the user; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `mini` is `min(100000000, abs(pk - ele))`; `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`; `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`; `lst` contains at least one index where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50; `i` is `n - 2`**.
