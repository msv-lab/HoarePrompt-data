The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a string of '0's and '1's. For each test case, it determines the smallest index (or 0 or the length of the string if no valid index exists) such that both the percentage of '0's up to that index and the percentage of '1's from that index to the end are at least 50%. It then outputs this index for each test case.
