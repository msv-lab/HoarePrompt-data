`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`n` and `a`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5; `a` is a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'.**
