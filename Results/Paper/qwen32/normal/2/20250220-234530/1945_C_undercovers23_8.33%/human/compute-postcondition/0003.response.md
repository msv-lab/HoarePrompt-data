The code snippet `s = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `s`. This means that `s` will now hold whatever string the user inputs.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4.
- `n` is the integer input by the user.
- `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'.

After executing `s = input()`, the value of `s` changes to the user's input, but the values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is the integer input by the user; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the string input by the user.**
