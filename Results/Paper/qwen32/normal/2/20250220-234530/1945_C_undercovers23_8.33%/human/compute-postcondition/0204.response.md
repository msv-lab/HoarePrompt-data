The code appends the value `0` to the list `final`. Since `final` was initially empty, after appending `0`, it now contains one element, which is `0`. The other variables, `c1`, `o`, `n`, `pk`, `elem`, and `mini`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`final` is sorted in ascending order, containing all indices from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem) == mini` and currently `final` is `[0]`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n` and `c1` is greater than or equal to 50.**
