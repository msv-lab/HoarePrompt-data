The code calculates the percentage of zeros encountered in the string `s` up to index `i` and assigns the ceiling of this percentage to the variable `zero_perc`. 

Given that `zero` is incremented when a '0' is encountered and `one` is incremented otherwise, the sum of `zero` and `one` equals `i + 1` (since indexing starts from 0).

Therefore, `zero_perc` is calculated as the ceiling of `(zero * 100) / (i + 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2; If the character at index `i` of the string `s` is '0', `zero` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `one` is incremented by 1; `zero_perc` is the ceiling of `(zero * 100) / (i + 1)`**.
