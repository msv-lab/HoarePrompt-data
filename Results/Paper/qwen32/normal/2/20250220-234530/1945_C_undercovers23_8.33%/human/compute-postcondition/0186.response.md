The given code snippet updates the value of `mini` by comparing its current value with the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. No other variables are modified.

Given:
- `mini` is initially calculated as `min(100000000, abs(pk - ele), min(mini, abs(pk - ele)))`.
- `pk` is `n // 2`.
- `ele` is the next element in `lst`.

After executing the line `mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))`, the value of `mini` will be the smaller of its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.

Output State: **`n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the new string input by the user; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `mini` is `min(mini, abs(pk - ele))`; `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`; `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`; `lst` contains at least one index where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50; `i` is `n - 2`; `ele` is the next element in `lst`.**
