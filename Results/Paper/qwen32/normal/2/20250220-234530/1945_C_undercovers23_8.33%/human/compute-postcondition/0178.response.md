The code snippet `lst.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Given the initial state, the only change is that the list `lst` will now include the value `i + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `one` is incremented by 1, `zero_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` includes the value `i + 1`.**
