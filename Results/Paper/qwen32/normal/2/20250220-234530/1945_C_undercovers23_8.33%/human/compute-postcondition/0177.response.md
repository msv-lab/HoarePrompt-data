To determine the output state, we need to consider the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

```
one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- If `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `one` is incremented by 1.
- `zero_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`.

The code snippet introduces a new variable `one_perc` which is calculated using the formula provided.

Let's break down the calculation:
- `one_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.
- Here, `o` is not defined in the initial state, so we assume `o` is a predefined variable representing the total number of ones initially.

Given the above, the output state will include the newly calculated `one_perc` along with the unchanged variables from the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `one` is incremented by 1, `zero_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.**
