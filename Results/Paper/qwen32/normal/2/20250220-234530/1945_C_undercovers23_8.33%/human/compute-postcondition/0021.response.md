The given code snippet calculates the percentage of zeros encountered so far in the string `s` up to the index `i`. The variable `zero_perc` is updated to reflect this percentage, rounded up to the nearest integer using `math.ceil`.

Given the initial state, `zero` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` is '1' or '0'. The variable `zero_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`.

Since `zero` is either 0 or 1, `zero * 100` will be either 0 or 100. Dividing this by `(i + 1)` and applying `math.ceil` will give either 0 or the smallest integer greater than or equal to `100 / (i + 1)`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `lst`, `mini`, `one`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is an integer input by the user and must be at least 2; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the string input by the user; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `lst` is an empty list; `mini` is 100000000; if `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is 1 and `one` is 0; if `s[i]` is '1', `zero` is 0 and `one` is 1; `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`.**
