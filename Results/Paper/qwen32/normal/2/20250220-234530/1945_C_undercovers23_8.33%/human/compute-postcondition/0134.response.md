Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the new string input by the user, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the original string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in the original string `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in the original string `s`, `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`, `zero` is the count of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `one` is the count of '1's in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `lst` contains indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50, `i` is `n - 2`, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`. Additionally, the length of `final` is 0, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, and `c1` is greater than or equal to 50.**
