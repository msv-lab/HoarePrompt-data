### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version.

#### Problem Recap:
- Alice has `n` coins.
- Bob wants Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.
- Bob can set up at most 60 stalls.
- Each stall can have a price per jewel between 1 and \(10^{18}\).
- Alice buys greedily: she buys as many jewels as possible from the first stall, then moves to the next stall, and so on.

#### Analysis of the Provided Program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (coins Alice has) and `k` (jewels Bob wants Alice to buy).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Case 1:** If `n == k`, it prints "YES", sets up 1 stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel, and returns. This is correct because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels with `n` coins if `n == k`.
   - **Case 2:** If `n < k`, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins. This is also correct.
   - **Otherwise:**
     - Initializes a list `costs` with two values: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
     - Calculates how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall using the formula `curr = n // i` and adjusts `n` accordingly.
     - Checks if the total number of jewels Alice can buy (`h`) is less than `k`. If so, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the prices of the stalls.

#### Issues in the Program:
- **Fixed Prices:** The program only considers two stalls with fixed prices (`n - k + 1` and `1`). This is insufficient to guarantee that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels in all cases.
- **Lack of Flexibility:** The program does not ensure that the number of stalls does not exceed 60, nor does it handle all edge cases, such as when `k` is very large compared to `n`.
- **Incorrect Logic:** The logic for determining the prices and the number of stalls is flawed. It does not consider a systematic approach to setting up the stalls and their prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

#### Correct Approach:
A correct strategy involves using the binary representation of `k` to determine the number of stalls and their prices. Each stall corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of `k`. Set the price of each stall to a power of 2 corresponding to the position of the bit. This ensures that Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels without exceeding the 60-stall limit.

#### Evaluation Based on Annotations:
- The annotations confirm that the program uses a fixed set of prices (`n - k + 1` and `1`) and checks if the total number of jewels Alice can buy is less than `k`.
- The annotations do not show any handling of the binary representation of `k` or ensuring that the number of stalls does not exceed 60.
- The annotations indicate that the program may incorrectly print "YES" or "NO" based on the fixed prices, which is not sufficient for all cases.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it fails to handle various cases and does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels with the constraints given.

**Final: False**
