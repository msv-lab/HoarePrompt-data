The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the elements in the `costs` list. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `costs` list and the current value of `i`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which means it has already taken the first value from the `costs` list. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should take the next value from the `costs` list.

Given that `costs` is `[1 - k, 1]`, the next value for `i` should be `1`.

State: **`n` is 0; `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\); `costs` is `[1 - k, 1]`; `h` is `h_initial + curr`; `curr` is 0; `i` is 1 - k**
