Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

- Initial State:
  - `n` is 0.
  - `k` is `k` (which means `k` is a variable with an unspecified value).
  - `costs` is `[1-k, 1]`.
  - `h` is `n-k+1`, which simplifies to `0-k+1` or `-k+1`.
  - It is mentioned that `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

Given these conditions, let's look at the print statement:
```python
print('YES')
```

The print statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`. None of the variables `n`, `k`, `costs`, or `h` are used in this print statement. Therefore, their specific values do not affect the output.

Output: **YES**
