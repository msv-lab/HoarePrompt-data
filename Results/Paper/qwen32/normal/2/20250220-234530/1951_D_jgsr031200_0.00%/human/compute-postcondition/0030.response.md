Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is `k` (which means `k` is a variable but its specific value is not provided).
- `costs` is `[1-k, 1]`.
- `h` is `n-k+1`, which simplifies to `0-k+1 = 1-k`.
- It is also mentioned that `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, but this condition does not affect the `costs` list directly.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*costs)
```

### Analysis:
- The `costs` list is explicitly defined as `[1-k, 1]`.
- The `*` operator in the `print` function unpacks the list and prints each element separated by a space.

### Output:
The `print(*costs)` statement will print the elements of the `costs` list, which are `1-k` and `1`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **1-k 1**
