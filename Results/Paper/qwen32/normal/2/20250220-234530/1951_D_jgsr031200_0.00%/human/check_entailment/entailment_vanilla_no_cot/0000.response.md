Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Stall Prices**:
   - The program attempts to use a hardcoded list `costs = [n - k + 1, 1]` which is not a general solution for creating up to 60 stalls that would ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - It also only checks two stalls (`h = 0` loop runs twice), which is insufficient for the problem constraints.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the scenario where `n == k` correctly. It should print `YES`, `1`, and `1` as output, but it prints `YES`, `1`, and `1` in an incorrect order (`print(2)` before `print('YES')`).

3. **General Solution**:
   - A correct approach would involve dynamically determining the stall prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One possible strategy is to use powers of 2 as stall prices, which ensures that Alice can buy a specific number of jewels without exceeding the total number of coins `n`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
        continue
    
    # Try to use powers of 2 to form k
    stalls = []
    current_k = k
    power = 0
    
    while current_k > 0 and power < 60:
        if (1 << power) & current_k:
            stalls.append(2 ** power)
            current_k -= (1 << power)
        power += 1
    
    if current_k > 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(len(stalls))
        print(' '.join(map(str, stalls)))
```

This program uses powers of 2 to determine the stall prices, ensuring that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels without exceeding the total number of coins `n`. If it is not possible to form `k` using up to 60 stalls, it outputs `NO`.
