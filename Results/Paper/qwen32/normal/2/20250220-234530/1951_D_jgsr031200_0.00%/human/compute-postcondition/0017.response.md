The given code snippet updates the value of `curr` to be `n // i`. Given that `i` is `1`, `curr` will simply be updated to the value of `n`.

Here's the updated state:

- `n` remains the remainder of `n` divided by `i`, which doesn't change its value since `i` is `1`.
- `k` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\) and `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- `costs` remains the list `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- `h` remains `h + curr`, which doesn't change its value here since `curr` is being recalculated.
- `curr` is now `n // i`, which simplifies to `n` because `i` is `1`.
- `i` remains `1`.

Output State: **`n` is the remainder of `n` divided by `1`; `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\) and `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`; `h` is `h + curr`; `curr` is `n`; `i` is `1`.**
