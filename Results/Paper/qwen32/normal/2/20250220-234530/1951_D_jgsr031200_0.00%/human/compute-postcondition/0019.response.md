The code snippet provided is `n -= i * curr`. Given the initial state, `curr` is 0, and `i` is 1. Therefore, the operation `i * curr` results in `1 * 0`, which is 0. Subtracting 0 from `n` does not change the value of `n`.

Thus, the value of `n` remains 0. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is 0; `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\); `costs` is `[1 - k, 1]`; `h` is `h_initial + curr`; `curr` is 0; `i` is 1.**
