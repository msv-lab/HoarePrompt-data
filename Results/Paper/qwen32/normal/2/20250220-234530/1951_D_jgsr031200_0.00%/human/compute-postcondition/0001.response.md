The initial state provides us with two positive integers, `n` and `k`, both of which are equal to each other. The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`, the fact that they are equal to each other does not influence the output of the statement. The `print` statement will simply output the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:

Output: **YES**
