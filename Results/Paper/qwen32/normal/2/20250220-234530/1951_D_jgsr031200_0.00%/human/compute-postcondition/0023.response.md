The given code snippet modifies the variable `n` by subtracting the product of `i` and `curr` from it. Given the initial state, `i` is `1 - k` and `curr` is `0`. Therefore, the expression `i * curr` evaluates to `0`.

Since `n` was initially `0` and we are subtracting `0` from it, the value of `n` remains `0`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is 0; `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\); `costs` is `[1 - k, 1]`; `h` is `h_initial`; `curr` is 0; `i` is 1 - k**.
