The code snippet `ans %= MOD` modifies the value of `ans` by taking its modulus with `MOD`. This operation ensures that `ans` remains within the bounds defined by `MOD`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `ans`, which now holds the value of `(ans + t) % MOD` reduced further by applying the modulus operation again.

Output State: **`t` is `(((twice the maximum cumulative sum encountered in the list `a` without going below 0) % MOD) * 2 % MOD) * 2 % MOD`; `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last sequence of non-negative sums before the loop ends; `ans` is `((ans + t) % MOD) % MOD`; `k` must be greater than 1; `i` is `k - 1`.**
