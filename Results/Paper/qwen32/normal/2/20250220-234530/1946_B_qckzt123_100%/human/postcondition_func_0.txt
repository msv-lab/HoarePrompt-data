The function reads multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it calculates a result based on the sum of a list of integers and the maximum subarray sum, then prints this result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The calculation involves doubling the maximum subarray sum up to \(k-1\) times and adding these values to the total sum of the list, all while taking care to handle large numbers using modulo operations.
