The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `k`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `k - 1`. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it defines the upper limit for the loop.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k - 1` and `k` should remain the same.

State: **`t` is `((twice the maximum cumulative sum encountered in the list `a` without going below 0) % MOD) * 2 % MOD`; `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last sequence of non-negative sums before the loop ends; `ans` is `((s + 2*t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t` which is equivalent to `ans % MOD`; `k` must be greater than 1; `i` is `k - 1`**
