The given code snippet updates the variable `t` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `tmp`. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Given the initial state, the only change is to `t`. The value of `t` will now be the greater of its previous value (which is 0) and the value of `tmp`.

Output State: **`t` is `max(tmp, 0)`, `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` is an integer, and `a` must have at least one element, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `x` is the next element in the list `a`. If `tmp` is less than 0, then `tmp` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `tmp` remains `tmp` + `x`.**
