The provided code snippet only defines a constant `MOD` with the value `1000000007`. No other variables are modified, and no operations are performed that would affect the initial state of `t`, `n`, `k`, or `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `MOD` is 1000000007.**
