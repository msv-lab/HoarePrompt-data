### Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem by calculating the maximum possible sum of the array after performing `k` operations. Each operation allows selecting any contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after `k` such operations and output the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic used in the program:

1. **Calculate the Total Sum (`s`)**: 
   - The sum of all elements in the array `a` is calculated. This represents the base sum before any operations.

2. **Find the Maximum Subarray Sum (`t`)**:
   - Using Kadane's algorithm, the program finds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within `a`. This is stored in `t`.
   - Kadane's algorithm iterates through the array, maintaining a running sum (`tmp`). If the running sum becomes negative, it resets to zero. The maximum value encountered during this process is the maximum subarray sum.

3. **Initial Answer Calculation**:
   - The initial answer is set to `(s + t) % MOD`, where `MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\). This accounts for the base sum plus the maximum subarray sum.

4. **Doubling the Maximum Subarray Sum**:
   - For each of the remaining `k-1` operations, the maximum subarray sum `t` is doubled and added to the answer. This is because inserting the maximum subarray sum into the array increases the total sum by that amount, and subsequent operations can double the effect of previous insertions.
   - The doubling is done modulo `MOD` to prevent overflow and ensure the result remains within the required range.

5. **Output the Result**:
   - After processing all operations, the final answer is printed.

### Verification Against Example Test Cases:

Let's verify the program against the example test cases provided:

- **Test Case 1**: `n=2`, `k=2`, `a=[-4, -7]`
  - Total sum `s = -11`
  - Maximum subarray sum `t = 0` (since all elements are negative, the best subarray is empty)
  - Initial answer `ans = (-11 + 0) % MOD = 999999996`
  - No further operations needed since `k=2` and we already have the initial answer.
  - Output: `999999996`

- **Test Case 2**: `n=3`, `k=3`, `a=[2, 2, 8]`
  - Total sum `s = 12`
  - Maximum subarray sum `t = 12` (the entire array)
  - Initial answer `ans = (12 + 12) % MOD = 24`
  - Doubling `t` for `k-1=2` operations:
    - First doubling: `ans = (24 + 24) % MOD = 48`
    - Second doubling: `ans = (48 + 48) % MOD = 96`
  - Output: `96`

- **Test Case 3**: `n=1`, `k=7`, `a=[7]`
  - Total sum `s = 7`
  - Maximum subarray sum `t = 7`
  - Initial answer `ans = (7 + 7) % MOD = 14`
  - Doubling `t` for `k-1=6` operations:
    - First doubling: `ans = (14 + 14) % MOD = 28`
    - Second doubling: `ans = (28 + 28) % MOD = 56`
    - Third doubling: `ans = (56 + 56) % MOD = 112`
    - Fourth doubling: `ans = (112 + 112) % MOD = 224`
    - Fifth doubling: `ans = (224 + 224) % MOD = 448`
    - Sixth doubling: `ans = (448 + 448) % MOD = 896`
  - Output: `896`

All example test cases match the expected outputs, confirming the correctness of the program.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, taking into account the constraints and requirements specified in the problem statement.
