Output State: **`t` is twice the maximum cumulative sum encountered in the list `a` without going below 0, `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last sequence of non-negative sums before the loop ends, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `k` must be greater than 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `t` has been doubled, while the values of `tmp`, `ans`, and the condition on `k` remain unchanged.
