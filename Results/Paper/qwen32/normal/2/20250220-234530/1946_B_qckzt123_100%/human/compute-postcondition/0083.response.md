The provided code snippet reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This operation does not affect the existing variables `t`, `tmp`, `ans`, or `T`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `(2^(k-1) * t) % MOD`, `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last sequence of non-negative sums before the loop ends, `ans` is `((s + t * (2^k - 2)) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from input, `k` is the second integer read from input`.**
