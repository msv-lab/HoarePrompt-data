The code snippet `t = max(tmp, t)` compares the current values of `tmp` and `t` and assigns the larger value to `t`. Given that both `t` and `tmp` are initially 0, the comparison results in `t` remaining 0.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `tmp` is 0, `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `k` are integers read from input such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` is an integer read from the input and `a` must have at least one element, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`.**
