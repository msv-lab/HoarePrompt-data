The code reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `T`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `MOD` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is the integer read from input representing the number of test cases; for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `MOD` is 1000000007.**
