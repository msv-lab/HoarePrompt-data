The code snippet `ans += t` modifies the value of `ans` by adding `t` to it. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `ans` is initially calculated as `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`. After executing `ans += t`, the new value of `ans` will be `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD`.

Output State: **`t` is `(2 * t) % MOD`; `tmp` is the final cumulative sum (or 0 if negative); `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD`; `T` is `T - 1`; `n` is the first integer read from input; `k` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the input line; `s` is the sum of the list `a`.**
