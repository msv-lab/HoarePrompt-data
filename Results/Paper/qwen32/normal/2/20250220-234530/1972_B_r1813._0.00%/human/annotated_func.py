#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string s of length n consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", where "U" represents a coin facing up and "D" represents a coin facing down.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        s = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    #State: `input` is assigned the entire input data read from the standard input; `data` is a list where the first element is the number of test cases `t` and the following elements are the concatenated strings of "U" and "D" for each test case; `index` is 1 + 2*t; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be 0; `results` is a list containing either the string 'YES' if `num_up_coins` is odd, or the string 'NO' if `num_up_coins` is even, for each test case.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `input` is assigned the entire input data read from the standard input; `data` is a list where the first element is the number of test cases `t` (which is 0) and there are no further elements; `index` is 1; `t` is 0; `results` is a list containing one element (either 'YES' or 'NO').
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a number of coins and a string indicating their orientations ("U" for up, "D" for down). It determines if the number of coins facing up is odd for each test case and outputs "YES" if it is odd, otherwise "NO".
