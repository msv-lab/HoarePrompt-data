The given Python code snippet appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. None of the other variables (`input`, `data`, `index`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `num_up_coins`) are modified by this operation.

Thus, the only change in the output state is that `results` now contains one additional element `'YES'`.

Output State: **`input` is assigned the entire input data read from the standard input; `data` is a list where the first element is the number of test cases `t` and the following elements are the concatenated strings of "U" and "D" for each test case; `index` is 7; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 2 and must be greater than or equal to 0; `results` is a list containing either the string 'YES' if `num_up_coins` is odd, or the string 'NO' if `num_up_coins` is even, and now includes an additional 'YES'; `n` is the integer value of `data[5]`; `s` is the value of `data[6]`; `num_up_coins` is `s.count('U')`.**
