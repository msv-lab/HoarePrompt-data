t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case in test_cases is a tuple containing three integers (n, x, y) where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and y = 0. Additionally, each test case includes a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The sum of x across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
