Postcondition: **`T` is `T`, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `list0` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `num` is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`. If `num` is 1, `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.**
