Postcondition: **`T` is T, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `list0` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `num` is `n - list0[-1]`, and `count` is the total number of times the previous value of `num` was equal to 1 during the iterations. If `num` equals 1, then `count` is incremented by 1.**
