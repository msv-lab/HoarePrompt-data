Postcondition: **`T` is `T - 1`, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n`, `y` are integers obtained from the input, `list0` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `count` is the number of times `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1` equals 1 for `i` ranging from 0 to `x - 2`, and if `num` equals 1, then `count` is incremented by 1. `num` is `n - list0[-1]`.**
