Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, and `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`. The current value of `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`.**
