The value of `mexsize` is incremented by 1. Initially, `mexsize` is 1, so after the increment, `mexsize` becomes 2. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `maxsize`, `sz`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` is 2, and `sz` equals 1.**
