The only variable in the loop head is `sz`, which iterates over the elements in the list `a`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `sz` for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `sz` was the current element from the list `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `sz` needs to take the value of the next element in the list `a`.

Since `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, and `sz` has just taken the value of the current element, the next value for `sz` should be the next element in the list `a`.

Here's how we adjust the state:

- `sz` should be updated to the next element in the list `a`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `maxsize`, `mexsize`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Given that we don't have the specific values of the list `a` or the current position of `sz` within the list, we can't specify the exact new value of `sz`. However, we know it will be the next element in the list.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, and `mexsize` is 2 if `sz` equals 1. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains 1, `sz` is the next element in the list `a`**.
