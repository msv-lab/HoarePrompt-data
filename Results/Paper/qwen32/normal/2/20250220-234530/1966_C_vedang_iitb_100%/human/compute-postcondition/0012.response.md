The code snippet increments the value of `mexsize` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `mexsize` was initially set to 2 if `sz` (the next element in the list `a`) equals 1, otherwise it was set to 1. After the increment, `mexsize` will be 3 if it was initially 2, or 2 if it was initially 1.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` is either 2 or 3 depending on its initial value, `sz` is the next element in the list `a`.**
