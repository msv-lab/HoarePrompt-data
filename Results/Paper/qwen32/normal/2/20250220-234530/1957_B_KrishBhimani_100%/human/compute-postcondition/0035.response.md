The given code snippet updates the value of `l1` by reading a new input line and splitting it into a list of strings. This means the previous values of `l1`, `n`, and `k` are overwritten by the new input.

Let's break down the changes:
- `l1` is reassigned to the result of `input().split()`, which means it now holds the new list of strings from the input.
- `n` and `k` are no longer derived from the old `l1` because `l1` has been updated. They will now be the integer values of the first and second elements of the new `l1`.

All other variables (`t`, `arr`, `k0`, `ans`, `temp`, `i`) remain unchanged unless they are explicitly modified later in the code, which they are not in the provided snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the new input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing the elements \(2^i - 1\), `k - (2^i - 1)`, and `n - 2` zeros; `temp` is the highest power of 2 that is less than `k`; `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\)**.
