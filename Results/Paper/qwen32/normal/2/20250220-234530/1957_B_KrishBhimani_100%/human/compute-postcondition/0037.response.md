Let's break down the initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - This variable is mentioned but not used in the provided code snippet.

2. **`l1`**: A list of strings obtained from the new input.
   - The exact contents of this list are not specified, but we know it contains at least two elements.

3. **`n`**: The integer value of the first element of `l1`.
   - `n` is derived from the first string in `l1` and converted to an integer.

4. **`k`**: The integer value of the second element of `l1`.
   - `k` is derived from the second string in `l1` and converted to an integer.

5. **`arr`**: An empty list.
   - This list is initialized but not used in the provided code snippet.

6. **`k0`**: Equal to `k`.
   - `k0` is a copy of the value of `k`.

7. **`ans`**: A list containing the elements \(2^i - 1\), `k - (2^i - 1)`, and `n - 2` zeros.
   - The exact values of these elements depend on the value of `i`, which is not yet determined.

8. **`temp`**: The highest power of 2 that is less than `k`.
   - This value is determined based on the value of `k`.

9. **`i`**: The largest integer such that \(2^i < k\).
   - This value is determined based on the value of `k`.

### Code Snippet Analysis:

The provided code snippet is simply:
```python
print(k)
```

### Determining the Output:

From the initial state, we know that `k` is derived from the second element of the list `l1` and is converted to an integer. Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `k`. However, we know that `k` is an integer and its value is taken from the second element of the list `l1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(k)` statement will be the integer value of `k`.

### Final Output:

Output: **k (where k is the integer value of the second element of the list `l1`)**
