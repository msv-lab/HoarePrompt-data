The code snippet `temp *= 2` doubles the value of the variable `temp`. Given the initial state, `temp` is initially set to 1. After executing the code, `temp` becomes 2.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the new input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `temp` is 2; `i` is 0; `temp * 2` is less than `k`.**
