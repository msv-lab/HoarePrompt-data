The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was initially either 0 or 1, after the increment, `i` will be either 1 or 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `n` is not equal to 1; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `temp` is either 2, 4, or 8; `i` is either 1 or 2.**
