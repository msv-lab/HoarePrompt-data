The given code snippet updates the value of `l1` by reading a new line of input and splitting it into a list of strings. This means the previous value of `l1` is overwritten.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `l1` is now a new list of strings obtained from the new input.
- `n` and `k` are no longer derived from the old `l1`; they will be derived from the new `l1`.
- `arr` remains an empty list.
- `k0` remains equal to `k` (but `k` will be updated based on the new `l1`).
- `ans` remains unchanged unless recalculated based on the new `n` and `k`.
- `temp` and `i` remain based on the previous `k` (but `k` will be updated).

Since `l1` is reassigned, `n` and `k` will need to be recalculated from the new `l1`. However, the problem asks us to only consider the changes made by the provided code snippet, which is the reassignment of `l1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the new input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to the old `k`; `ans` is unchanged; `temp` is the highest power of 2 that is less than the old `k`; `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < \text{old } k\)**.
