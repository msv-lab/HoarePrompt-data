You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        
        n, k = list(map(int, l1))
        
        if n == 1:
            print(k)
        else:
            arr = []
            k0 = k
            i = 0
            ans = []
            temp = 1
            while True:
                if temp * 2 < k:
                    temp *= 2
                    i += 1
                else:
                    break
            ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
            ans.append(k - sum(ans))
            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
            print(*ans)
        
    #State: After all iterations, the program will have processed all `t` test cases, and the final output state will be that `t` is 0, and all other variables (`arr`, `k0`, `ans`, `temp`, `i`) will reflect the state after processing the last test case. Specifically, `arr` will be an empty list, `k0` will be the value of `k` from the last test case, `ans` will contain the computed values for the last test case, `temp` will be the highest power of 2 less than `k` from the last test case, and `i` will be the corresponding exponent.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k`. It returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
