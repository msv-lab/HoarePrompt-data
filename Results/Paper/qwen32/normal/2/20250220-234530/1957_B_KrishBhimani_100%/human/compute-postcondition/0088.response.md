Given the initial conditions and the code snippet, let's determine the output state:

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the new input
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`
- `arr` is an empty list
- `k0` is equal to `k`
- `ans` is an empty list
- `temp` is either 1, 2, or 4
- `i` is either 0, 1, or 2
- Specifically, if `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `temp` is 2 and `i` is 1; otherwise, `temp` remains 1 and `i` remains 0. If `temp * 2` is not less than `k` and `temp` was initially 2, then `temp` becomes 4 and `i` becomes 2.

Code Snippet:
```
temp *= 2
```

Impact of the code:
- The value of `temp` is doubled.

Let's consider the possible values of `temp` before the operation and their outcomes:
1. If `temp` was initially 1:
   - After `temp *= 2`, `temp` becomes 2.
2. If `temp` was initially 2:
   - After `temp *= 2`, `temp` becomes 4.
3. If `temp` was initially 4:
   - After `temp *= 2`, `temp` becomes 8.

Since the value of `i` does not change due to this operation, we keep its value as it was before.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the new input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `temp` is either 2, 4, or 8; `i` is either 0, 1, or 2.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The value of `temp` is doubled. If `temp` was 1, it becomes 2. If `temp` was 2, it becomes 4. If `temp` was 4, it becomes 8.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
