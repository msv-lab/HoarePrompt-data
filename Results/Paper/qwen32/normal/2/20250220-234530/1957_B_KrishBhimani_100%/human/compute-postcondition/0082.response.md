In this case, the `while` loop is specified as `while True:`, which means the loop will continue indefinitely unless there is a `break` statement inside the loop body (which is omitted here). Since the loop condition is always `True`, no adjustments to the program state are necessary to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged from the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the new input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `temp` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `temp * 2` is less than `k` or not; `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `temp * 2` is less than `k` or not. Specifically, if `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `temp` is 2 and `i` is 1; otherwise, `temp` remains 1 and `i` remains 0.**
