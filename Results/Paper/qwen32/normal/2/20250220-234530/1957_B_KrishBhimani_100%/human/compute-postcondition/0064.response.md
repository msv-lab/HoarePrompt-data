Let's break down the given initial state and determine the values of the variables involved in the `print(*ans)` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable does not directly affect the `ans` list or its contents.
   
2. **`l1`**: A list of strings obtained from the new input. It contains at least two elements.
   - `n`: The integer value of the first element of `l1`. This represents the length of the `ans` list.
   - `k`: The integer value of the second element of `l1`. This is used to calculate the elements of the `ans` list.

3. **`arr`**: An empty list. This list is not used in the calculation of `ans`.

4. **`k0`**: Initially set to the value of `k`. This variable is not used in the calculation of `ans`.

5. **`ans`**: A list constructed as follows:
   - It starts with the element \(2^i - 1\), where \(i\) is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.
   - The next element is \(k - (2^i - 1)\).
   - If necessary, additional zeros are added to make the length of `ans` equal to `n`.

6. **`temp`**: The highest power of 2 less than `k`. This is used to calculate \(2^i - 1\).

7. **`i`**: The exponent of `temp`, i.e., the highest integer such that \(2^i \leq k\).

### Calculation of `ans`:

- Determine the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. Let's denote this power of 2 as `temp = 2^i`.
- Calculate the first element of `ans` as \(2^i - 1\).
- Calculate the second element of `ans` as \(k - (2^i - 1)\).
- If the length of `ans` is less than `n`, add zeros to `ans` until its length equals `n`.

### Example Calculation:

Let's assume `l1 = ["5", "10"]`, so `n = 5` and `k = 10`.

- The highest power of 2 less than or equal to 10 is 8 (\(2^3\)), so `temp = 8` and `i = 3`.
- The first element of `ans` is \(2^3 - 1 = 7\).
- The second element of `ans` is \(10 - 7 = 3\).
- Since `n = 5`, we need to add three zeros to `ans` to make its length 5.

Thus, `ans = [7, 3, 0, 0, 0]`.

### General Description:

Given the initial state, the `ans` list is constructed based on the values of `n` and `k` from the `l1` list. The first element of `ans` is \(2^i - 1\) where \(2^i\) is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. The second element is \(k - (2^i - 1)\). If necessary, zeros are added to `ans` to ensure its length is `n`.

### Final Output:

Output: **[2^i - 1, k - (2^i - 1), 0, ..., 0] (where 2^i is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to k, and the number of zeros added is n - 2 if n > 2)**
