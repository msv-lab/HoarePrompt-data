To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop operates and when it terminates. The loop doubles the value of `temp` as long as `temp * 2` is less than `k`. Once `temp * 2` is no longer less than `k`, the loop breaks.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, let's analyze the final state:

- `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, `ans` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- `temp` will be the highest power of 2 that is less than `k`.
- `i` will be the number of times `temp` was doubled, which is equivalent to the largest integer `m` such that \(2^m < k\).

Let's denote the final value of `temp` as \(2^m\) where \(2^m < k \leq 2^{m+1}\). Therefore, `i` will be \(m\).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `n` is not equal to 1; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `temp` is the highest power of 2 that is less than `k`; `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\).**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `temp` will be the largest power of 2 that is still smaller than `k`, and `i` will be the exponent of that power of 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
