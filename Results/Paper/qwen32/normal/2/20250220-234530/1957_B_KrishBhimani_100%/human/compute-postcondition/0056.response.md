Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the new input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list. If `temp * 2` was less than `k` initially, then `temp` is set to 8 and `i` is set to 1. Otherwise, `temp` remains 2 and `i` remains 0.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `temp` is doubled. If `temp` was initially 4 (which means `temp * 2` was less than `k`), it is now 8. If `temp` was initially 1 (which means `temp * 2` was not less than `k`), it is now 2. The values of `t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The value of `i` also remains unchanged unless `temp` was initially 4, in which case it remains 1.
