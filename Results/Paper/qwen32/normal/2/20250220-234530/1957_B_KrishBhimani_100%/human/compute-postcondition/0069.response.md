To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the relevant variables:

1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the new input.
3. `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
4. `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.
5. `arr` is an empty list.
6. `k0` is equal to the old `k`.
7. `ans` is unchanged.
8. `temp` is the highest power of 2 that is less than the old `k`.
9. `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < \text{old } k\).

From the above initial state, we see that `k` is directly assigned the integer value of the second element of the list `l1`. There are no operations or changes to `k` mentioned after this assignment in the provided initial state.

Thus, when the `print(k)` statement is executed, it will print the integer value of `k`, which is the integer value of the second element of the list `l1`.

Output: **k (where k is the integer value of the second element of the list `l1`)**
