Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value returned by `input()` which is within the range [1, 10^4]**.

This means that the variable `t` retains its initial value, while `n` is now assigned the integer value provided by the `input()` function, which is guaranteed to be within the specified range.
