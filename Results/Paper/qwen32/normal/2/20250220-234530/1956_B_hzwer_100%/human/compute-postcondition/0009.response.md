The only object in the loop head is the variable `x`, which iterates over the list `a`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how `x` changes.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is the integer value returned by `input()` which is within the range [1, 10^4].
- `a` is a list of integers with at least one element.
- `cnt` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements where `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1, `x` is the next element in the list `a`.
- The value of `cnt[x]` has already been increased by 1 for the current `x`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was the current element from the list `a`, and `cnt[x]` was incremented by 1. For the next iteration, `x` should be the next element in the list `a`.

Therefore, if `x` was the `i`-th element in the list `a` during the previous iteration, it should now be the `(i+1)`-th element in the list `a` for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value returned by `input()` which is within the range [1, 10^4], `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `cnt` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements, `x` is the next element in the list `a`**.

Since we don't know the exact position of `x` in the list `a` from the previous state, we can only say that `x` is now the next element in the sequence. If `x` was the `i`-th element, it is now the `(i+1)`-th element.

To be precise, if `x` was `a[i]` in the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `x` will be `a[i+1]`.

However, without knowing the exact index `i`, we can represent the state as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value returned by `input()` which is within the range [1, 10^4], `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `cnt` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements, `x` is the next element in the list `a`**.

If we assume `x` was `a[i]` before, then the new state would be `x = a[i+1]`, but since we don't have the exact index, we leave it as the next element in the list.

So the final state is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value returned by `input()` which is within the range [1, 10^4], `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `cnt` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements, `x` is the next element in the list `a`**.
