The code snippet provided is:

```python
n = int(input())
```

This line of code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state mentions that `n` is already an input integer, but since the code reassigns `n`, the new value of `n` will be whatever integer is provided by the input.

The other variables (`iterations_left`, `a`, `cnt`, and `ans`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`iterations_left` is 1; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `x` is the count of how many times `x` appears in `a`; `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`.**
