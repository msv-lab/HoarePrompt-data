### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided solution to ensure its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
- We have a deck of `2n` cards with integers from `1` to `n`, each appearing exactly twice.
- Cards are distributed between two players, each receiving `n` cards.
- Players take turns placing cards on the table.
- A player earns a point if they place a card that already exists on the table.
- Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

#### Objective:
Determine the maximum number of points you can achieve if you play optimally.

#### Key Observations:
- Each number appears exactly twice, so every number will eventually be placed on the table twice.
- For each number that appears twice in your hand, you can earn a point if you place the second card after the first one has been placed on the table by either player.
- The strategy revolves around how many pairs of numbers you have in your hand because each pair can potentially give you a point.

#### Provided Solution Analysis:
The solution counts the occurrences of each number in your hand and calculates the number of pairs. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Counting Occurrences**: The code uses a list `cnt` to count the occurrences of each number in your hand.
2. **Calculating Points**: For each number `x` in your hand, if it appears more than once (`cnt[x] > 1`), you can earn a point for each additional occurrence beyond the first one (`max(0, cnt[x] - 1)`).
3. **Summing Points**: The total points you can earn is the sum of these values for all numbers.

#### Correctness Verification:
- The logic correctly identifies that for each number appearing twice in your hand, you can earn one point.
- The solution assumes that Nene plays optimally, but since the question asks for the maximum points you can achieve regardless of Nene's strategy, the focus is on maximizing your own points based on the distribution of cards in your hand.
- The provided solution efficiently counts the pairs and calculates the points, which aligns with the problem requirements.

#### Annotations:
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- Before the function call, `t` is the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` is the number of cards each player receives, and `a` is the list of `n` integers representing the cards in your hand.
- The function processes each test case, counts the occurrences of each number, calculates the points based on the pairs, and prints the result.

#### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can achieve based on the given constraints and the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
