The code initializes a list `cnt` with `n + 1` zeros. This means that `cnt` will have a length of `n + 1` and all elements will be initialized to 0. The values of `iterations_left`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`iterations_left` is decremented by 1 from its previous value and must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**
