To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand what the loop does. The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `a` and increments the corresponding index `x` in the list `cnt` by 1.

Here's the breakdown of the process:

- **Initial State:**
  - `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (This variable is not used in the loop and remains unchanged.)
  - `n`: An integer value returned by `input()` which is within the range [1, 10^4].
  - `a`: A list of integers.
  - `cnt`: A list of integers with `n + 1` elements, all initialized to 0.

- **Loop Execution:**
  - For each element `x` in the list `a`, the loop increments `cnt[x]` by 1.

After the loop has completed all iterations, the list `cnt` will reflect the frequency of each integer in the list `a`. Specifically, `cnt[i]` will contain the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.

**Final Output State:**
- `t`: Remains unchanged as it was initially.
- `n`: Remains unchanged as it was initially.
- `a`: Remains unchanged as it was initially.
- `cnt`: A list of integers with `n + 1` elements where each element `cnt[i]` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value returned by `input()` which is within the range [1, 10^4], `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements where `cnt[i]` is the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.**
