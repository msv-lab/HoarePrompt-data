Let's break down the given initial state and determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **iterations_left**: This variable is set to 1, but it does not affect the calculation of `ans` directly.
2. **n**: This is a new input integer. Since no specific value is given for `n`, we'll refer to it as `n`.
3. **a**: This is a new list of integers read from the input. We'll denote this list as `a = [a1, a2, ..., ak]`, where `k` is the length of the list `a`.
4. **cnt**: This is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element at index `i` represents the frequency of integer `i` in the list `a`. So, `cnt[i]` gives the number of times `i` appears in `a`.
5. **ans**: This is the sum of `(x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt` where `x > 1`. In other words, for each unique integer `i` in `a` that appears more than once, we add the count of `i` minus one to `ans`.

### Calculation of `ans`:

To find `ans`, we need to:
- Count the frequency of each integer in the list `a` and store these counts in `cnt`.
- For each count `x` in `cnt` that is greater than 1, compute `x - 1` and sum these values.

### Example Calculation:

Let's consider an example to illustrate this:
- Suppose `n = 5` and `a = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]`.
- The `cnt` list would be `[0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 0]` because:
  - `0` appears 0 times,
  - `1` appears 1 time,
  - `2` appears 2 times,
  - `3` appears 3 times,
  - `4` appears 0 times,
  - `5` appears 0 times.
- Now, we calculate `ans`:
  - For `cnt[1] = 1`, since it is not greater than 1, we do not add anything.
  - For `cnt[2] = 2`, we add `2 - 1 = 1` to `ans`.
  - For `cnt[3] = 3`, we add `3 - 1 = 2` to `ans`.
  - For `cnt[4] = 0` and `cnt[5] = 0`, we do not add anything.
- Therefore, `ans = 1 + 2 = 3`.

### General Description:

Given the initial state, `ans` is computed based on the frequencies of integers in the list `a`. Without knowing the specific values of `n` and `a`, we can only describe `ans` in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of (x - 1) for all x in cnt where x > 1, and cnt is the frequency list of integers in a)**
