Given the initial state and the print statement:

Initial State: 
```
print(ans)
```

There is no additional context provided about the variable `ans`. Therefore, it's impossible to determine the explicit value of `ans` from the given information. 

However, we can describe the output in terms of what `ans` represents based on the precondition.

Output: **ans (where ans is a variable whose value is not explicitly provided in the initial state)**
