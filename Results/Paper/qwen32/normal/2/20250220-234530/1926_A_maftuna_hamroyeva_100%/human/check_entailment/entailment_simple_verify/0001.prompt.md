You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        l = 0
        h = 0
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each of the t test cases, there is a string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings are distinct.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        l = 0
        
        h = 0
        
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
        
    #State: t is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive; i is t-1 (indicating the last iteration); a is the last input string; l is the number of 'A's in the last input string; h is the number of characters in the last input string that are not 'A'. If l is greater than h, then 'A' is printed; otherwise, 'B' is printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. **String Processing**: For each test case, it reads a string `a` of length 5.
3. **Counting Characters**: It initializes two counters, `l` and `h`, to zero. These counters are used to count occurrences of 'A' and 'B', respectively.
4. **Character Counting Loop**: It iterates through each character in the string `a`. If the character is 'A', it increments `l`; otherwise, it increments `h`.
5. **Comparison and Output**: After counting, it compares the values of `l` and `h`. If `l` is greater than `h`, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'.

### Analysis:

- The logic for counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' is correct.
- The comparison to determine which character appears more frequently is also correct.
- The program handles all possible inputs as per the problem description (strings of length 5 containing only 'A' and 'B').

### Edge Cases Considered:

- All 'A's: "AAAAA" should return 'A'.
- All 'B's: "BBBBB" should return 'B'.
- Mixed strings where 'A' and 'B' appear equally (e.g., "ABABB") should return 'B' according to the program's logic, which matches the problem statement's expected output.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine which letter ('A' or 'B') appears most frequently in each test case string. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
