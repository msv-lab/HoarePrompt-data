The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the string `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `a` and the current character `j`. Since `a` is a non-empty string and `i` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it means that the first character of `a` has just been processed. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more character in the string `a` to be processed.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` was the first character of `a` (let's denote it as `a[0]`). For the next iteration, `j` should be the second character of `a` (which is `a[1]`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `j` is now the second character of `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive; `i` is 0; `a` is a non-empty string with at least two characters; `j` is the second character of `a`; if `j` is 'A', then `l` is 1 and `h` is 0; otherwise, `l` is 0 and `h` is 1.**
