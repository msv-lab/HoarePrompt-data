Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive; `i` is 0; `a` is a non-empty string with at least two characters; `j` is the second character of `a`; if `j` is 'A', then `l` is 2 and `h` is 0; otherwise, `l` is 1 and `h` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `l` is incremented by 1. If `j` was 'A', `l` was initially 1 and is now 2. If `j` was not 'A', `l` was initially 0 and is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
