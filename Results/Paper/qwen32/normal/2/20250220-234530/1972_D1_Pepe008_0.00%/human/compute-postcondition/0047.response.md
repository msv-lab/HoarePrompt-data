To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the expression assigned to `x` using the given initial state.

Given:
- Initial State: `b` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
- Code: `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`

Since `a` and `i` are not mentioned in the initial state, we'll assume they are defined elsewhere in the program. However, we can still express the new value of `x` in terms of `a` and `i`.

The expression for `x` is:
\[ x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1 \]

This means `x` is calculated based on the values of `a` and `i`. Since `b` is not used in the calculation of `x`, its value remains unchanged.

Output State: **`b` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`**
