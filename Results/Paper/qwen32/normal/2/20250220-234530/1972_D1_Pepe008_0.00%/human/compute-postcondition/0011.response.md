The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `b`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value, and `b` is greater than 0. Since the loop iterates from 1 to `b` inclusive, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, and it should still be less than or equal to `b`.

Let's assume at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k`. For the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`. The value of `b` remains the same because it defines the upper limit of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `T` is greater than 0; `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line; `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`; `b` is greater than 0; `suma` is \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\) if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0\); `x` is \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\) if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0\). If `a - i * (i - 1) <= 0`, `suma` and `x` remain unchanged; `i` is \(k + 1\)**

Since we don't know the exact value of `k`, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `T` is greater than 0; `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line; `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`; `b` is greater than 0; `suma` is \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\) if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0\); `x` is \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\) if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0\). If `a - i * (i - 1) <= 0`, `suma` and `x` remain unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1**
