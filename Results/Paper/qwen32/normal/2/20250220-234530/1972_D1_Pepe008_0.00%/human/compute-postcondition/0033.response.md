The code snippet `suma += x` adds the value of `x` to the variable `suma`. Given the initial state, the value of `x` is already defined as \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\). This means that `suma` will be updated to its current value plus the value of `x`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is \(t + 1\), `T` is greater than 0, `info` is a new list of strings obtained from splitting the new input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is an integer value greater than or equal to 1, `i` is \(i + 1\), `x` is \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\), `suma` is `suma + x`.**
