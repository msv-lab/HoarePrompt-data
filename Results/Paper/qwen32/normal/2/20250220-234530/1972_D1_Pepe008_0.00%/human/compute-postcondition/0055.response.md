To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`. The variable `b` is the upper bound of the loop and does not change within the loop. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `b` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.
- If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, then `suma` is `suma + x`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:
- `i` should be incremented by 1.
- `b` remains unchanged.

State: **`b` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 2`, `x` is `(a - (i + 1) * i) // (i + 1)`. If `a - (i + 1) * i > 0`, then `suma` is `suma + x`.**

Note: The values of `x` and `suma` are recalculated based on the new value of `i`. However, since the task specifies adjusting only the states of objects in the loop head (`i` and `b`), we don't explicitly state the recalculated values of `x` and `suma` in the final state.

Final State: **`b` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 2`**.
