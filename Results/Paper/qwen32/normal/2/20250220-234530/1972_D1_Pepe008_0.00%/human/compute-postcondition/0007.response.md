To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the expression for `x` using the given initial state. The expression for `x` is:

\[ x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1 \]

However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state. Since `i` is not specified, we cannot compute a specific value for `x`. But we can express `x` in terms of `a` and `i`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `T` must be greater than 0
- `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`
- `b` is an integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1
- `suma` is 0

After executing the code snippet, `x` will be calculated using the formula above.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `T` must be greater than 0; `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line; `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`; `b` is an integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1; `suma` is 0; `x` is \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\)**

This means `x` is now defined in terms of `a` and `i`, while all other variables retain their initial states.
