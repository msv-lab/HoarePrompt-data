The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter, and assigns this list to the variable `info`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4 and `T` must be greater than 0. These conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` must be greater than 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line.**
