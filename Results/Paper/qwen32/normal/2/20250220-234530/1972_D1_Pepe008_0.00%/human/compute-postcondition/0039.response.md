To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop evolves with each iteration and how the variables change.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is incremented by 1.
- `T` is greater than 0.
- `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting a new input line.
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`.
- `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`.
- `suma` is initialized to 0.

### Loop Execution:
The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = b` (inclusive). In each iteration:
- `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
- If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, then `suma` is incremented by `x`.

### Final Output State:
After the loop completes all its iterations (`i` goes from 1 to `b`), the final values of the variables will be:
- `t` remains `t + 1` (unchanged from the initial state since `t` is only incremented once outside the loop).
- `T` remains greater than 0 (unchanged from the initial state).
- `info` remains the same list of strings obtained from splitting the new input line (unchanged from the initial state).
- `a` remains the integer value of `info[0]` (unchanged from the initial state).
- `b` remains the integer value of `info[1]` (unchanged from the initial state).
- `suma` will be the sum of all valid `x` values calculated during the loop iterations.

### Calculation of `suma`:
`suma` accumulates the value of `x` for each iteration where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`. The exact value of `suma` depends on the specific values of `a` and `b`.

### Final Output State in Specified Format:
Output State: **`t` is \(t + 1\), `T` is greater than 0, `info` is a new list of strings obtained from splitting the new input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`, `suma` is the accumulated sum of `x` for all iterations where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop finishes executing all its iterations, the variable `t` remains incremented by 1 from its initial state. The variable `T` remains greater than 0. The list `info` and the integers `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The variable `suma` holds the total sum of all `x` values calculated in each iteration where the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` is satisfied.
