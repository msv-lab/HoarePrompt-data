To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the array `a` based on the elements in the `odds` list. The loop iterates over each element in `odds`, updating the array `a` symmetrically around its center.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `a` is initialized as a list of `n` zeros.
   - `prev` is initialized to 0.
   - `idx` is initialized to `(n - 1) // 2`, which is the middle index of the array `a`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each element `x` in `odds`:
     - If `idx` is equal to `n - 1 - idx` (which means `idx` is the exact middle index for odd-length arrays), set `a[idx]` to `x`.
     - Otherwise, set `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` to `(x - prev) // 2`.
     - Update `prev` to `x`.
     - Decrement `idx` by 1.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `a` will be filled with values symmetrically from the center outwards based on the differences between consecutive elements in `odds`.
   - `prev` will hold the last value from `odds`.
   - `idx` will be `-1` if the loop iterated over all elements in `odds`.

Let's formalize the final output state:

- `a`: The array `a` will be filled with values derived from the `odds` list, symmetrically around its center.
- `prev`: The last element of the `odds` list.
- `idx`: `-1` after the loop has processed all elements in `odds`.

### Example Calculation

Suppose `n = 5` and `odds = [10, 6, 2]`.

- **Initial State**:
  - `a = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
  - `prev = 0`
  - `idx = 2`

- **First Iteration** (`x = 10`):
  - `idx == n - 1 - idx` is false, so `a[2] = a[2] = (10 - 0) // 2 = 5`
  - `a = [0, 0, 5, 0, 0]`
  - `prev = 10`
  - `idx = 1`

- **Second Iteration** (`x = 6`):
  - `idx == n - 1 - idx` is false, so `a[1] = a[3] = (6 - 10) // 2 = -2`
  - `a = [0, -2, 5, -2, 0]`
  - `prev = 6`
  - `idx = 0`

- **Third Iteration** (`x = 2`):
  - `idx == n - 1 - idx` is true, so `a[0] = 2`
  - `a = [2, -2, 5, -2, 0]`
  - `prev = 2`
  - `idx = -1`

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`a = [2, -2, 5, -2, 0], prev = 2, idx = -1`**

In natural language, the array `a` is filled with values derived from the `odds` list, symmetrically around its center, `prev` holds the last value from `odds`, and `idx` is `-1` indicating the loop has completed all iterations.
