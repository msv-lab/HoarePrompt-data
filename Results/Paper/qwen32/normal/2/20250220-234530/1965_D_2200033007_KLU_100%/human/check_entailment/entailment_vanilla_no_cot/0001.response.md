To determine if the given Python program correctly solves the problem, we need to analyze each function and how they work together to recover the palindrome array `a`.

### Function Analysis

#### Function 1: `func_1(a)`
- This function generates all possible subarray sums of the array `a`.
- It iterates through all possible starting points `i` of subarrays and calculates the cumulative sum up to each endpoint `j`.
- These sums are collected in the list `cts` and sorted.
- This function is used to generate the subarray sums of a candidate array `a` to compare with the given sums.

#### Function 2: `func_2(cts)`
- This function takes a list of subarray sums `cts` and removes duplicates by keeping track of the counts.
- If a sum appears twice consecutively, it is removed (indicating it's a duplicate subarray sum).
- This function is used to identify the unique subarray sums from the list of all subarray sums.

#### Function 3: `func_3(odds, n)`
- This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the list of unique subarray sums `odds`.
- It initializes an array `a` of size `n` with zeros.
- It iterates through the list `odds`, assigning values to `a` based on the difference between consecutive sums.
- The middle element of the palindrome is directly assigned if `n` is odd.
- For other elements, it assigns half the difference between consecutive sums to the current index and its symmetric counterpart.
- This function is the core of the solution, aiming to reconstruct the original palindrome array.

#### Function 4: `func_4(bigList, smallList)`
- This function finds the missing subarray sum by comparing two lists: `bigList` (all subarray sums) and `smallList` (given subarray sums).
- It removes common elements from the end of both lists until they differ.
- The last element of `bigList` is returned as the missing subarray sum.
- This function is used to identify the missing subarray sum from the given sums.

### Overall Process
1. Generate all subarray sums of a candidate array `a` using `func_1`.
2. Identify the unique subarray sums using `func_2`.
3. Reconstruct the palindrome array `a` from these unique subarray sums using `func_3`.
4. Identify the missing subarray sum using `func_4`.

### Verification Against Example
Let's verify the process with the first example case:
- Input: `n = 3`, Sums: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 1]`
- Missing sum: `3`
- Candidate array: `[1, 2, 1]`
- Subarray sums: `[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4]`
- Unique sums: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
- Reconstructed array: `[1, 2, 1]`

The reconstructed array matches the expected output, indicating the correctness of the program.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis and verification, the program correctly reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the given subarray sums.

Correctness: **True**
