You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    500000000 1000000000 500000000 500000000 1000000000

Output

    1 2 1 
    7 2 2 7 
    3 5 5 3 
    6 4 4 6 
    1 1 1 1 1 
    2 1 2 1 2 
    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to ensure that it accurately reconstructs a palindrome array `a` from the given subarray sums, excluding one sum. Let's analyze the code step-by-step and verify its correctness.

### Analysis of the Code

1. **func_1(a)**:
   - This function generates all possible subarray sums of the array `a` and sorts them.
   - It ensures that we have all subarray sums in a sorted order, which will be useful later for comparison.

2. **func_2(cts)**:
   - This function takes the sorted list of subarray sums (`cts`) and processes it to find the unique subarray sums that appear an odd number of times.
   - The logic here is based on the observation that if a subarray sum appears an even number of times, it can be paired up with another identical subarray sum. Only the subarray sum that is missing will appear an odd number of times.
   - The function uses a stack-like approach to remove pairs of identical sums, leaving only the odd-count sums.

3. **func_3(odds, n)**:
   - This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the list of odd-count subarray sums (`odds`).
   - It initializes an array `a` of size `n` with zeros and fills it in a way that maintains the palindrome property.
   - The function iterates through the `odds` list, calculating the difference between consecutive sums to determine the values of the array elements.
   - The middle element of the palindrome is handled separately since it appears only once.

4. **func_4(bigList, smallList)**:
   - This function seems to be designed to find the missing subarray sum by comparing two lists (`bigList` and `smallList`).
   - However, this function is not used in the main logic of reconstructing the palindrome array and appears to be redundant.

### Main Logic

The main logic involves using `func_1` to generate all subarray sums, `func_2` to filter out the odd-count sums, and `func_3` to reconstruct the palindrome array.

### Verification

Let's verify the correctness of the program using the provided examples and additional test cases.

#### Example Verification

1. **First Example**:
   - Input: `n = 3`, `subarray_sums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 1]`
   - Expected Output: `[1, 2, 1]`
   - The program should correctly identify the missing subarray sum and reconstruct the palindrome array.

2. **Second Example**:
   - Input: `n = 4`, `subarray_sums = [18, 2, 11, 9, 7, 11, 7, 2, 9]`
   - Expected Output: `[7, 2, 2, 7]`
   - The program should correctly identify the missing subarray sum and reconstruct the palindrome array.

3. **Third Example**:
   - Input: `n = 4`, `subarray_sums = [5, 10, 5, 16, 3, 3, 13, 8, 8]`
   - Expected Output: `[3, 5, 5, 3]`
   - The program should correctly identify the missing subarray sum and reconstruct the palindrome array.

4. **Fourth Example**:
   - Input: `n = 4`, `subarray_sums = [8, 10, 4, 6, 4, 20, 14, 14, 6]`
   - Expected Output: `[6, 4, 4, 6]`
   - The program should correctly identify the missing subarray sum and reconstruct the palindrome array.

5. **Fifth Example**:
   - Input: `n = 5`, `subarray_sums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`
   - Expected Output: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - The program should correctly identify the missing subarray sum and reconstruct the palindrome array.

6. **Sixth Example**:
   - Input: `n = 5`, `subarray_sums = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 8]`
   - Expected Output: `[2, 1, 2, 1, 2]`
   - The program should correctly identify the missing subarray sum and reconstruct the palindrome array.

7. **Seventh Example**:
   - Input: `n = 3`, `subarray_sums = [500000000, 1000000000, 500000000, 500000000, 1000000000]`
   - Expected Output: `[500000000, 500000000, 500000000]`
   - The program should correctly identify the missing subarray sum and reconstruct the palindrome array.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the provided code and verifying it against the examples, it appears that the program correctly reconstructs the palindrome array from the given subarray sums, excluding one sum. The code handles the logic of identifying the missing subarray sum and reconstructing the palindrome array accurately.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described in the problem statement for all the provided examples and potential edge cases.
