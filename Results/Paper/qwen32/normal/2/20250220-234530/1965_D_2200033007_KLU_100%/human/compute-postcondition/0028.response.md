Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `odds`, which is a list of integers representing the sums of certain subarrays of a palindrome array `a`, and `n`, which is an integer representing the length of the palindrome array `a` with the constraint that 3 <= n <= 1000. The function always returns the list `[2, -2, 5, -2, 0]`.**
