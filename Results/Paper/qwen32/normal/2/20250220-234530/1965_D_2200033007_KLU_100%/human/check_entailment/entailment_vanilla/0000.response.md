Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Function `func_1(a)`:
- This function generates all possible subarray sums of the array `a` and stores them in the list `cts`.
- It iterates through each starting index `i` of the array and calculates the cumulative sum from `i` to the end of the array.
- It appends each cumulative sum to the list `cts`.
- Finally, it sorts the list `cts` and returns it.

#### Function `func_2(cts)`:
- This function takes a sorted list of subarray sums (`cts`) and processes it to find the "odd" sums.
- It initializes an empty list `odds`.
- It iterates through each element in `cts`. If the current element is equal to the last element in `odds`, it removes the last element from `odds` (indicating that this sum appears twice and thus is not "odd"). Otherwise, it adds the current element to `odds`.
- This process effectively removes all sums that appear an even number of times, leaving only the sums that appear an odd number of times in `cts`.

#### Function `func_3(odds, n)`:
- This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the list of "odd" sums (`odds`).
- It initializes an array `a` of length `n` with zeros.
- It uses a variable `prev` to keep track of the previous sum in `odds` and an index `idx` to place elements symmetrically in `a`.
- For each element `x` in `odds`, it calculates the value to be placed in `a` at position `idx` and its symmetric position `n - 1 - idx` using the formula `(x - prev) // 2`.
- If `idx` is the middle index (for odd-length arrays), it directly assigns the value `x` to `a[idx]`.
- It updates `prev` to the current sum `x` and decrements `idx` to move towards the center of the array.
- Finally, it returns the reconstructed palindrome array `a`.

#### Function `func_4(bigList, smallList)`:
- This function identifies the missing subarray sum.
- It compares the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` and removes them if they are equal, indicating that these sums are present in both lists.
- It continues this process until the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are different.
- It then returns the last element of `bigList`, which is the missing subarray sum.

### Overall Process:
- The main logic involves generating all subarray sums of a potential palindrome array, identifying the sums that appear an odd number of times, and using these to reconstruct the original palindrome array.
- The missing subarray sum is identified by comparing the generated sums with the provided sums and finding the discrepancy.

### Verification:
- The program correctly identifies the missing subarray sum by leveraging the properties of palindromes and the frequency of subarray sums.
- The reconstruction of the palindrome array from the "odd" sums is logically sound and ensures that the resulting array is indeed a palindrome.

### Conclusion:
Based on the above analysis, the program correctly solves the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
