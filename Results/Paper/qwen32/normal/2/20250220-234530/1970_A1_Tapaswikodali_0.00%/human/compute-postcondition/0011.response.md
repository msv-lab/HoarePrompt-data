The code snippet increments the `balance` variable by 1. Given that `balance` was initially part of a tuple in the `details` list and represented the balance of parentheses (1 for "(", -1 for ")"), incrementing `balance` means adjusting this value accordingly.

Since `char` is the second character of `s` and `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, `char` could be either "(" or ")". However, the exact value of `char` does not affect the calculation of `balance` directly in this context because `balance` is being incremented by 1 regardless of `char`.

The `details` list contains one tuple `(balance, 0, char)`. After the operation `balance += 1`, the `balance` in the tuple will reflect this change. The `i` variable remains unchanged, and `char` also remains the same.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and represents a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `details` is a list containing one tuple `(balance + 1, 0, char)` where `balance` is adjusted by adding 1; `i` is 1; `char` is the second character of `s`.**
