The code appends a tuple `(balance, -i, char)` to the `details` list. Given the initial state, `details` was an empty list, `i` was 0, and `char` was the first character of the string `s`. Since `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, `char` can either be "(" or ")". If `char` is "(", then `balance` is 1; otherwise, `balance` is -1.

After executing the code, `details` will contain one tuple with the values `(balance, -i, char)`. The values of `s`, `i`, and `char` remain unchanged. The value of `balance` depends on whether `char` is "(" or ")".

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and represents a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `details` is a list containing one tuple `(balance, 0, char)` where `balance` is 1 if `char` is "(" and -1 if `char` is ")"; `i` is 0; `char` is the first character of `s`.**
