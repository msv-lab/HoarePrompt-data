To determine the new state after the given Python code is executed, let's break down the changes:

- `s` remains unchanged as it is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and represents a balanced parentheses sequence.
- `details` initially contains one tuple `(balance, 0, char)`. After the code execution, another tuple is appended to `details`. The new tuple is `(balance, -i, char)`.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 2.
- `char` remains unchanged as it is the second character of `s`.

Given that `balance` is adjusted by adding 1 if `char` is "(", and subtracting 2 if `char` is ")", and `i` was initially 1, the new tuple added to `details` will be `(balance, -1, char)`.

Therefore, the updated `details` list will contain two tuples: the original one and the newly appended one.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and represents a balanced parentheses sequence; `details` is a list containing two tuples `[(balance, 0, char), (balance, -1, char)]`; `i` is 2; `char` is the second character of `s`.**
