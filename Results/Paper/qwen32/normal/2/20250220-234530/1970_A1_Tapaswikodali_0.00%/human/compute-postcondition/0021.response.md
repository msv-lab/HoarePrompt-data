The `details` list contains tuples `(balance, -i, char)`. Sorting this list will order the tuples first by `balance`, then by `-i` (which means in descending order of the original index `i`), and finally by `char`.

Given that `balance` is initially 0 and changes as we iterate through the string `s` of balanced parentheses, the sorting will primarily be influenced by the `balance` value. Characters with the same `balance` value will then be ordered by their original index in descending order.

Since the string `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, the `balance` values will range from a minimum (when there are more closing parentheses) to a maximum (when there are more opening parentheses). The exact values depend on the sequence of `(` and `)` in `s`.

After sorting, the `details` list will be reordered according to these criteria. The `s` string and `balance` variable remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and represents a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `balance` is 0; `details` is a sorted list containing tuples `(balance, -i, char)` for each character in `s`, ordered by `balance` and then by `-i`.**
