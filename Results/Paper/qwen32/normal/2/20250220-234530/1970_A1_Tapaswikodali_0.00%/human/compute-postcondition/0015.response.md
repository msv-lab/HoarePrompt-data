The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `char`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s` and its length. Since `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `char` must be updated to the third character of `s`.

Given that `i` is 2 and `char` is the second character of `s` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be 3 and `char` should be the third character of `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and represents a balanced parentheses sequence; `details` is a list containing two tuples `[(balance, 0, char), (balance, -1, char)]`; `i` is 3; `char` is the third character of `s`.**
