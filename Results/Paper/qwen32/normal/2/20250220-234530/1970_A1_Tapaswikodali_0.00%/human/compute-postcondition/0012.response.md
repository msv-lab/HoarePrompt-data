Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and represents a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `details` is a list containing one tuple `(balance, 0, char)` where `balance` is 0 if `char` is "(" and -2 if `char` is ")"; `i` is 1; `char` is the second character of `s`.**

Explanation: The value of `balance` in the tuple within the `details` list is decremented by 1. Since the initial `balance` was 1 (if `char` was "(") or -1 (if `char` was ")"), it becomes 0 (if `char` was "(") or -2 (if `char` was ")"). All other variables remain unchanged.
