The code snippet `balance -= 1` decreases the value of the variable `balance` by 1. The other variables (`s`, `details`, `i`, and `char`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and represents a balanced parentheses sequence; `details` is a list containing two tuples `[(balance, 0, char), (balance, -1, char)]`; `i` is 3; `char` is the third character of `s`; `balance` is decreased by 1.**
