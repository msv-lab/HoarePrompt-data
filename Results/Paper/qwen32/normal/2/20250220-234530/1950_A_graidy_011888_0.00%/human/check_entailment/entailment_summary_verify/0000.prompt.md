You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
from random import randint

def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        y = randint(1, 9)
        z = randint(1, 9)
        res = ''
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        print(res)
        i += 1



- Function Summary: 
The function generates and prints 1000 sets of three random integers between 1 and 9. For each set, it determines and prints whether the sequence forms a 'peak', 'stair', or 'none' based on specific conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The program generates random test cases and checks if they form a "stair", "peak", or "none" based on the conditions given. However, the program does not read input from the user or handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. Instead, it randomly generates values for `x`, `y`, and `z` and prints the results. This behavior does not align with the requirement to process specific input values provided by the user.

To be correct, the program should read the number of test cases `t` and then process each test case by reading three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` for each case. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def determine_shape(a, b, c):
    if a < b < c:
        return "STAIR"
    elif a > b > c:
        return "PEAK"
    else:
        return "NONE"

def main():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        result = determine_shape(a, b, c)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version reads the number of test cases and processes each test case according to the problem description, checking if the digits form a "stair", "peak", or "none" and printing the appropriate result.
