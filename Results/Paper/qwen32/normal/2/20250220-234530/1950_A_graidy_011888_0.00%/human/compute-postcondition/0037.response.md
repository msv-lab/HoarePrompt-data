The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to 1000, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. Since `i` is currently 3, which is less than 1000, the loop can certainly execute one more time without any adjustment to `i`.

Therefore, no other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; `i` is 3; `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9; `y` and `z` are new random integers between 1 and 9. If `x` < `y`, then if `y` is greater than `z`, `res` is 'peak'; if `y` is less than `z`, `res` is 'stair'; if `y` is equal to `z`, `res` is 'none'. Otherwise, `res` is 'none'**
