Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; `i` is 2; `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9; `y` is a new random integer between 1 and 9; `z` is a new random integer between 1 and 9; `res` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The variable `res` is explicitly set to an empty string by the line `res = ''`. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
