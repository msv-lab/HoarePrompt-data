To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state:

- `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`.
- `t` is an integer representing the number of iterations.
- `i` is equal to `t` after the loop.
- `results` is a list with at least `t+2` elements.
- `r` is the `(t+2)`th element in `results`.

Given this information, the variable `r` is specifically defined as the element at index `t+1` in the list `results` (since list indices start at 0).

However, the exact value of `r` cannot be determined without knowing the specific contents of the `results` list. Therefore, we can only describe `r` in terms of its position within the list.

Output: **r (where r is the (t+2)th element in the results list)**
