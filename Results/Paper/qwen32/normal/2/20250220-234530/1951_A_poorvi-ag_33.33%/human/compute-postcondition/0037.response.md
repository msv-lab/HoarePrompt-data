To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the behavior of the loop based on the provided conditions and how it modifies the `results` list.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Iteration Behavior**:
   - For each iteration (`i` from `0` to `t-1`), the loop reads an integer `n` and a string `arr`.
   - It checks the number of '1's in `arr` and whether '11' is a substring.
   - Depending on these conditions, it appends either `'yes'` or `'no'` to the `results` list.

2. **Conditions**:
   - If `arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr`, it appends `'no'`.
   - If `arr.count('1') % 2 == 0` (and the previous condition is not met), it appends `'yes'`.
   - Otherwise, it appends `'no'`.

### Final Output State:
After all `t` iterations, the `results` list will contain `t` elements, each determined by the conditions described above. The `start`, `end`, and `t` variables remain unchanged, and `i` will be equal to `t` after the loop completes.

### Output State Format:
Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is an integer representing the number of iterations; `i` is equal to `t` after the loop; `results` is a list of `t` elements, each being either `'yes'` or `'no'` based on the conditions evaluated during each iteration.**

### Human-readable Description:
The final state after the loop has completed all `t` iterations is that `start` and `end` remain as they were initially, `t` remains the same, `i` equals `t`, and `results` is a list containing `t` elements. Each element in `results` is either `'yes'` or `'no'`, determined by the specific conditions checked during each iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is an integer representing the number of iterations; `i` is equal to `t` after the loop; `results` is a list of `t` elements, each being either `'yes'` or `'no'` based on the conditions evaluated during each iteration.**
