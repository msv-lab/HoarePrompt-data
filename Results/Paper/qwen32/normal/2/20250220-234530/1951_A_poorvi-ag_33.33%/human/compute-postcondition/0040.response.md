In this task, the loop iterates over each element in the `results` list. The loop variable `r` takes on the value of each element in the list during each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`
- `t` is an integer representing the number of iterations
- `i` is equal to `t` after the loop
- `results` is a list with at least one element

We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop. The only variables in the loop head are `r` and `results`. Since the loop iterates over `results`, the state of `results` does not change from one iteration to the next. However, `r` will take on the value of the next element in the list.

Let's assume that the loop has already iterated `t` times, meaning `r` has taken on the values of the first `t` elements of `results`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in `results` after the `t`th element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `r` will be the next element in `results` after the `t`th element.
- `results` remains the same list with at least `t+1` elements.
- `start` and `end` remain unchanged.
- `t` remains unchanged because it represents the number of iterations completed so far, not the current index in the loop.

Since we don't have specific values for `start`, `end`, `t`, or the exact elements of `results`, we can only describe the general state.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is an integer representing the number of iterations; `i` is equal to `t` after the loop; `results` is a list with at least `t+1` elements; `r` is the `(t+1)`th element in `results`**
