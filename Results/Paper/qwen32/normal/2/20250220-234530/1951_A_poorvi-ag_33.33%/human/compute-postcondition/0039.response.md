To determine what will be printed by the `print(r)` statement, let's carefully analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State Recap:
- `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`.
- `t` is an integer representing the number of iterations.
- `i` is equal to `t` after the loop.
- `results` is a list with at least one element.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(r)
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet attempts to print a variable named `r`. However, the initial state does not mention any variable named `r`. This implies that the variable `r` must be defined somewhere in the code that is not provided in the initial state or the code snippet.

Given the information provided, we cannot determine the value of `r` because it is not explicitly defined or mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot provide a precise description of what will be printed.

However, if we assume that there is a typo and the intended variable to print was `results` (since it is the only list mentioned in the initial state), then the output would be the contents of the `results` list.

But since the question specifically asks about `r`, and `r` is not defined, we must conclude that the value of `r` is unknown based on the given information.

### Conclusion:
Since the variable `r` is not defined in the provided initial state or code snippet, we cannot determine what will be printed. If we assume there is no typo and `r` is indeed the intended variable, the output cannot be determined from the given information.

Thus, the most precise description we can provide is:

Output: **r (where r is an undefined variable)**

However, if we consider the context and assume `r` might have been a typo for `results`, then:

Output: **results (where results is a list with at least one element)**

Given the strict adherence to the format and the information provided, the correct response is:

Output: **r (where r is an undefined variable)**
