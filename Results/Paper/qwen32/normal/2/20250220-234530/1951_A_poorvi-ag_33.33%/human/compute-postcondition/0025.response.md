Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `arr` is the new string input from the user, and `results` is a list. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's with '11' as a substring, `results` contains three strings, the first being `'no'`, the second being `'no'`, and the third being `'no'`. Otherwise, `results` contains one additional string `'no'`.**

Natural Language: The `results` list now contains one more element `'no'`. All other variables remain unchanged.
