Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer, and `arr` is the new string input from the user. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's with '11' as a substring, `results` contains either two strings `'no', 'no'` (if the condition was true and `results` was modified accordingly) or three strings `'no', 'no', 'yes'` (if the condition was true and an additional `'yes'` was appended). Otherwise, `results` contains one additional element `'yes'` appended to its previous contents.**
