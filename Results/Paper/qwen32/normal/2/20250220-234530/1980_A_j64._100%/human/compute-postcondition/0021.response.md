Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the length of the string `a`), `m` (an integer representing the minimum required occurrences of each character from 'A' to 'G'), and `a` (a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'). The function returns `needed_problems`, which is the total number of additional problems needed to ensure that each character from 'A' to 'G' appears at least `m` times in the string `a`.**
