You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 5. a is a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.

    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and always returns 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it initializes a dictionary `d` using `defaultdict` with a default value function `default_value`. However, the function `default_value` is not defined anywhere in the code. This would normally raise an error, but since the dictionary keys are explicitly set to 0 later, this issue does not affect the functionality.
   - It reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`.
   - It reads the string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

2. **Counting Problem Difficulties**:
   - The program initializes the count of each difficulty level ('A' through 'G') to 0.
   - It then iterates over the string `s` and increments the count for each difficulty level found in the string.

3. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total number of additional problems needed.
   - It iterates over the keys in the dictionary `d` (which represent the difficulty levels).
   - For each difficulty level, if the count of problems (`d[val]`) is less than or equal to `m`, it adds `m - d[val]` to `ans`. This logic seems flawed because it assumes that every difficulty level must appear exactly `m` times, which is not the requirement. The requirement is that each round should have at least one problem of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G', and there are `m` such rounds. Therefore, the correct check should be whether the count of any difficulty level is less than `m`, and if so, add `m - d[val]` to `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case, which represents the minimum number of additional problems needed.

### Issues Identified:
- The logic for calculating `ans` is incorrect. The current logic incorrectly sums up the difference between `m` and the count of each difficulty level, regardless of whether the count is less than `m` or not. The correct approach should be to ensure that each difficulty level appears at least `m` times in total across all rounds.
- The function `func_1()` is defined but never used, which is unnecessary and can be removed.

### Correct Approach:
- For each difficulty level, calculate the total required count as `m` (since each round needs one problem of each difficulty level).
- Calculate the shortage for each difficulty level as `max(0, m - d[val])` and sum these shortages to get the total number of additional problems needed.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the program is not correct as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
