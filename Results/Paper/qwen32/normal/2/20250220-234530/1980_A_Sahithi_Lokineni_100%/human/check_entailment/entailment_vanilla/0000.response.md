Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it initializes a dictionary `d` using `defaultdict` with a default value function `default_value`. However, the function `default_value` is not defined anywhere in the code. This would normally raise an error, but since the dictionary keys are explicitly set to 0 later, this issue does not affect the functionality.
   - It reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`.
   - It reads the string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

2. **Counting Problem Difficulties**:
   - The program initializes the count of each difficulty level ('A' through 'G') to 0.
   - It then iterates over the string `s` and increments the count for each difficulty level found in the string.

3. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total number of additional problems needed.
   - It iterates over the keys in the dictionary `d` (which represent the difficulty levels).
   - For each difficulty level, if the count of problems (`d[val]`) is less than or equal to `m`, it adds `m - d[val]` to `ans`. This logic seems flawed because it assumes that every difficulty level must appear exactly `m` times, which is not the requirement. The requirement is that each round should have at least one problem of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G', and there are `m` such rounds. Therefore, the correct check should be whether the count of any difficulty level is less than `m`, and if so, add `m - d[val]` to `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case, which represents the minimum number of additional problems needed.

### Issues Identified:
- The logic for calculating `ans` is incorrect. The current logic incorrectly sums up the difference between `m` and the count of each difficulty level, regardless of whether the count is less than `m` or not. The correct approach should be to ensure that each difficulty level appears at least `m` times in total across all rounds.
- The function `func_1()` is defined but never used, which is unnecessary and can be removed.

### Correct Approach:
- For each difficulty level, calculate the total required count as `m` (since each round needs one problem of each difficulty level).
- Calculate the shortage for each difficulty level as `max(0, m - d[val])` and sum these shortages to get the total number of additional problems needed.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the program is not correct as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
