The code `t -= 1` subtracts 1 from the variable `t`. Given that the initial state specifies `t = True`, and in Python, `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0`, the operation `t -= 1` will convert `t` from `True` (or `1`) to `False` (or `0`). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **[0, 0, v1, v2, ..., vk], u = 0, t = False**
