The provided code snippet defines a lambda function `r` that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer. This function is typically used to read multiple integers from a single line of input efficiently.

Given the initial state, the only change introduced by the code is the definition of the lambda function `r`. No other variables are modified or introduced, and no computations are performed that would affect the existing variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `x_i`, or `y_i`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the addition of the lambda function `r`.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and for each query, x_i and y_i are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i; r is a lambda function that reads and maps integers from input.**
