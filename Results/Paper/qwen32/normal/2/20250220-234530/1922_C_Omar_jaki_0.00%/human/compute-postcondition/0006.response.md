Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n+2 integers starting with -1000000000.0, followed by the original n integers, and ending with 2000000000.0, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and for each query, x_i and y_i are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n+2 and x_i ≠ y_i; `r` is a lambda function that reads and maps integers from input, and `r()` has been called; `b` is a list containing two zeros `[0, 0]`.**

Explanation: The only change made by the code is the initialization of the list `b` with two zeros. All other variables retain their initial values.
