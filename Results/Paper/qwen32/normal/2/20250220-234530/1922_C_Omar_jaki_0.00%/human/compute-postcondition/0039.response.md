Postcondition: **The list remains [0, 0, v1, v2, ..., vk]; `u` is at least 0; `c` and `d` are the values returned by `r()`, with `c` being less than `d` or `c` being greater than or equal to `d`. Regardless of whether `c < d` or not, the list, `u`, and the relationship between `c` and `d` remain unchanged.**
