Postcondition: **`t` is a specific integer between 1 and 1000; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input; the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd; `i` is `i + 1`. Regardless of whether the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd, `i` is incremented by 1.**
