Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a specific integer between 1 and 1000.
- `a` and `b` are two integers read from the input.
- The absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('Bob')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, or `i`. It simply outputs the string `'Bob'`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `i`. It will always print the string `'Bob'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Bob**
