### Reasoning:
To determine the winner of the game, we need to analyze the strategy and possible outcomes based on the initial number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

The key observation here is that the game revolves around the parity (odd or even nature) of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Initial Parity Analysis**:
   - If the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets (`abs(a - b)`) is even, Bob will always win if both play optimally.
   - If the difference is odd, Alice will always win if both play optimally.

2. **Strategy Explanation**:
   - When the difference is even, no matter what move Alice makes (swapping or not), Bob can always mirror her move to maintain an even difference until the end, ensuring he makes the last valid move.
   - When the difference is odd, Alice can always make a move that results in an even difference for Bob, putting Bob in a losing position if both play optimally.

Given these observations, the provided code correctly determines the winner based on the parity of `abs(a - b)`:
- If `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`, it prints "Bob".
- Otherwise, it prints "Alice".

This matches the expected outcomes as per the problem statement and examples provided.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the optimal play strategy derived from the parity of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

**Correctness: True**
