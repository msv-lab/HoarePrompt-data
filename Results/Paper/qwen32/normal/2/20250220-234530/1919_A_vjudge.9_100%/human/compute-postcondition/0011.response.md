Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet:

- `t` is a specific integer between 1 and 1000.
- `a` and `b` are two integers read from the input.
- The absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('Alice')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, or `i`. It simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **Alice**
