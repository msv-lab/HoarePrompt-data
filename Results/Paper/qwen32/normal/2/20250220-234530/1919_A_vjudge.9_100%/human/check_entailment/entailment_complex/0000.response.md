### Reasoning:

To determine the winner of the game, we need to analyze the strategy and the conditions under which each player can force a win.

Given the rules:
1. Players alternate turns.
2. Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
3. A player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
4. The player who cannot make a move loses.

Let's consider the optimal strategy:
- If the number of coins in both wallets is the same (`a == b`), no matter what Alice does, Bob can mirror her moves and eventually force Alice into a losing position.
- If the number of coins in the wallets is different (`a != b`), Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob in a situation where the number of coins in the wallets is equal after his turn. This means Alice can force Bob into the losing position.

The key observation here is that the parity (even or odd nature) of the absolute difference between `a` and `b` determines the winner:
- If `abs(a - b)` is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves and win.
- If `abs(a - b)` is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob with an even difference, forcing Bob into a losing position.

Thus, the logic in the provided program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the absolute difference between `a` and `b`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
