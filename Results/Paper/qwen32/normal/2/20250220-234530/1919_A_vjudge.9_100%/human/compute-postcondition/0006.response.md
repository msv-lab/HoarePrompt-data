Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

- `t` is a specific integer between 1 and 1000. However, the value of `t` does not affect the print statement in this case.
- `a` and `b` are two integers read from the input.
- The absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd.

The Python code snippet is:
```python
print('Alice')
```

This print statement simply outputs the string `'Alice'` regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, and `b`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **Alice**
