### Reasoning:

To determine the winner of the game, we need to analyze the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob. Let's break down the game mechanics and derive a winning strategy.

1. **Game Mechanics Recap:**
   - Alice and Bob take turns.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
   - After choosing, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move (i.e., when both wallets are empty) loses.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The game revolves around the parity (odd or even nature) of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - If the difference `abs(a - b)` is even, the second player (Bob) can always mirror the first player's (Alice's) moves and force a win.
     - For example, if Alice swaps, Bob swaps; if Alice doesn't swap, Bob doesn't swap. This ensures that Bob will always be able to make a move until Alice is forced into a losing position.
   - Conversely, if the difference `abs(a - b)` is odd, the first player (Alice) can always force a win using a similar mirroring strategy.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the above observations, the winner can be determined solely by checking the parity of `abs(a - b)`.
   - If `abs(a - b)` is even, Bob wins.
   - If `abs(a - b)` is odd, Alice wins.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of `abs(a - b)` and printing the appropriate winner for each test case.
