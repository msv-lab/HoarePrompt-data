### Reasoning:

To determine the winner of the game, we need to analyze the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob. Here's the key insight:

- If the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets (`abs(a - b)`) is even, Bob will always win.
- If the absolute difference is odd, Alice will always win.

Let's break down why this is the case:

1. **Even Difference (`abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`)**:
   - When the difference is even, after each pair of moves (one by Alice and one by Bob), the difference remains even.
   - This means that eventually, the wallets will reach a state where both have the same number of coins, and Alice will be forced to make the last move, leaving Bob with the winning position.

2. **Odd Difference (`abs(a - b) % 2 != 0`)**:
   - When the difference is odd, after each pair of moves, the difference remains odd.
   - This means that Alice can always force Bob into a losing position because she can ensure that Bob is the one left with the last coin to remove.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the absolute difference between `a` and `b`. If it's even, it outputs "Bob"; otherwise, it outputs "Alice".

### Conclusion:

The program correctly determines the winner based on the optimal strategies described above. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
