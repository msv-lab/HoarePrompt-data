The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`. Since `t` is a constant that determines the number of iterations, it does not change during the loop execution. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value, and `t` is a specific integer between 1 and 1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `t`. Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1.

The values of `a` and `b` and their absolute difference (which is either even or odd) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a specific integer between 1 and 1000; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input. The absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd; `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more precise in the format requested:

State: **`t` is a specific integer between 1 and 1000; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input. The absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd; `i` is [value of i from the previous iteration] + 1**.

Since the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration is not specified, we can leave it as an increment operation:

State: **`t` is a specific integer between 1 and 1000; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input. The absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd; `i` is incremented by 1**.
