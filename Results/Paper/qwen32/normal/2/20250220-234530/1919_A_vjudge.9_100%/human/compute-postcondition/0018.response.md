Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is a specific integer between 1 and 1000. For each of the `t` test cases, two integers `a` and `b` were read from the input. The program printed "Bob" if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` was even, otherwise it printed "Alice". The variable `i` has been incremented from 0 up to `t-1` during the loop's execution.**

In simpler terms: The loop has run for all `t` specified test cases. For each test case, it determined if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` was even or odd, printing "Bob" for even and "Alice" for odd. The loop counter `i` has gone through all values from 0 to `t-1`.
