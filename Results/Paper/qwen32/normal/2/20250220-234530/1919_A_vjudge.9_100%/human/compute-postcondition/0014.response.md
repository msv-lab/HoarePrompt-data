The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This means the values of `a` and `b` will be updated to whatever integers are provided in the input. The other variables (`t` and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a specific integer between 1 and 1000; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input; the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd; `i` is `i + 1`.**
