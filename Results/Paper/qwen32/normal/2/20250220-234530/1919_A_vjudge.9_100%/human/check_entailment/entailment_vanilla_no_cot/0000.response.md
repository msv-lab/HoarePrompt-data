To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic behind the game and how the winner is determined.

### Game Analysis:
- Alice and Bob take turns.
- Each player can either swap wallets or not, then remove one coin from their current wallet.
- The player who cannot make a move loses.

### Key Insight:
The game can be analyzed using the concept of Nim-sum (XOR operation) in combinatorial game theory, but here it simplifies due to the specific rules and constraints.

- If `a == b`, Alice will always lose because no matter what she does, Bob can mirror her moves and force her into a losing position.
- If `a != b`, Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob in a position where `a == b` on Bob's turn, forcing Bob into a losing position.

### Simplified Logic:
- If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even (`abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`), Bob wins because Alice cannot force an odd difference.
- If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd (`abs(a - b) % 2 != 0`), Alice wins because she can force an even difference on Bob's turn.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements this logic. It checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd and prints "Bob" or "Alice" accordingly.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
