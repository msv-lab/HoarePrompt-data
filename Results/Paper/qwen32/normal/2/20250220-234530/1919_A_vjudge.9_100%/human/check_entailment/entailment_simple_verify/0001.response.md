### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key insight is that if the difference `abs(a - b)` is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves and force a win. If the difference is odd, Alice can use a similar mirroring strategy to ensure her victory.

Let's analyze the provided program and its annotations to verify if it correctly implements this logic:

1. **Program Logic:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, `a` and `b`.
   - It then checks the parity of `abs(a - b)`:
     - If `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`, it prints "Bob".
     - Otherwise, it prints "Alice".

2. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations confirm that the program reads the input values correctly and processes each test case independently.
   - After processing all test cases, the program outputs the correct winner based on the parity of `abs(a - b)`.

3. **Validation:**
   - The annotations show that the program correctly identifies the parity of `abs(a - b)` and assigns the winner accordingly.
   - The original assessment correctly explains the reasoning behind the logic and confirms that the program's implementation matches the derived strategy.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of `abs(a - b)`. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
