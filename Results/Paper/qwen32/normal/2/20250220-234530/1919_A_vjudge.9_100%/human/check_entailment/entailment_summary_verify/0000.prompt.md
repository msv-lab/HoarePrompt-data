You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

    1000000000 1000000000
    
    53110 2024

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, and prints "Bob" if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, otherwise it prints "Alice".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to see if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice and Bob take turns playing a game with their wallets containing `a` and `b` coins respectively.
- Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet and remove one coin.
- The player who cannot make a valid move loses.
- Both players play optimally.
- Determine who will win the game given the initial number of coins in both wallets.

### Analysis of the Program:
The provided program makes a decision based on the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. Specifically, it checks if the absolute difference is even or odd:
- If `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`, it prints "Bob".
- Otherwise, it prints "Alice".

### Key Insight:
The game can be analyzed using the concept of Nim-sum (XOR operation) in combinatorial game theory. However, for this specific problem, we can observe a simpler pattern:
- If the number of coins in both wallets is the same (`a == b`), then Alice will always lose because she will always be forced into a losing position after Bob mirrors her moves.
- If the number of coins is different, the player with more coins can always force the other player into a losing position by ensuring the difference remains odd after each of their turns.

### Verification:
Let's verify the program against the provided examples and some additional edge cases.

#### Provided Examples:
1. `1 1` -> `abs(1 - 1) % 2 == 0` -> "Bob" (Correct)
2. `1 4` -> `abs(1 - 4) % 2 != 0` -> "Alice" (Correct)
3. `5 3` -> `abs(5 - 3) % 2 != 0` -> "Alice" (Correct)
4. `4 5` -> `abs(4 - 5) % 2 != 0` -> "Alice" (Correct)
5. `11 9` -> `abs(11 - 9) % 2 != 0` -> "Alice" (Correct)
6. `83 91` -> `abs(83 - 91) % 2 != 0` -> "Alice" (Correct)
7. `1032 9307` -> `abs(1032 - 9307) % 2 != 0` -> "Alice" (Correct)
8. `839204 7281` -> `abs(839204 - 7281) % 2 != 0` -> "Alice" (Correct)
9. `1000000000 1000000000` -> `abs(1000000000 - 1000000000) % 2 == 0` -> "Bob" (Correct)
10. `53110 2024` -> `abs(53110 - 2024) % 2 != 0` -> "Alice" (Correct)

All the provided examples match the expected results.

#### Additional Edge Cases:
1. `2 2` -> `abs(2 - 2) % 2 == 0` -> "Bob" (Correct)
2. `3 3` -> `abs(3 - 3) % 2 == 0` -> "Bob" (Correct)
3. `10 10` -> `abs(10 - 10) % 2 == 0` -> "Bob" (Correct)
4. `1 2` -> `abs(1 - 2) % 2 != 0` -> "Alice" (Correct)
5. `2 1` -> `abs(2 - 1) % 2 != 0` -> "Alice" (Correct)
6. `1000000000 1000000001` -> `abs(1000000000 - 1000000001) % 2 != 0` -> "Alice" (Correct)

All these additional edge cases also match the expected results.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and verification, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly determines the winner based on whether the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd. This approach aligns with the optimal strategy for both players, ensuring that the program produces the correct result for all given test cases and additional edge cases.
