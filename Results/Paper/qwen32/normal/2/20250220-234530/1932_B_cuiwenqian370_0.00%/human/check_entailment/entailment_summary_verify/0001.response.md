### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the problem and the provided code to understand why.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur.
- Each sign occurs periodically every `a_i` years.
- Signs must occur sequentially, meaning the next sign can only occur after the previous one has occurred.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(path)`**:
   - This function processes a string `path` and uses dynamic programming to count occurrences of '@' symbols while avoiding '*' symbols.
   - The function does not involve any calculations related to periodic events or sequential occurrences as required by the problem.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - Reads input from standard input.
   - Parses the input into test cases.
   - Calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the result.
   - Since `func_1` does not solve the problem, `func_2` also does not solve the problem.

#### Mismatch Between Problem and Code:
- The problem requires calculating the year of the n-th sign based on periodic occurrences.
- The provided code counts '@' symbols in a string, which is unrelated to the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not solve the intended problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not perform any operations related to determining the year of the n-th sign based on its periodicity and sequential occurrence.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
