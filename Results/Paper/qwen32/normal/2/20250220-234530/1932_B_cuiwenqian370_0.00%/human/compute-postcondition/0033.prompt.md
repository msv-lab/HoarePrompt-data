Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `path` is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*', and `n` is the length of `path`. `n` is greater than 0. `dp` is a list of integers with `n` elements. If `n` is 1, `dp` remains unchanged as per the precondition. If `n` is greater than 1, the first element of `dp` is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', otherwise it is `-inf`. The second element of `dp` is `-inf` if the first character of `path` is '*', or if the second character of `path` is '*'; otherwise, it is 2 if the second character of `path` is '@' or 1 if the second character of `path` is '*'. The rest of the elements in `dp` are 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(2, n):
    if path[i] == '*':
        dp[i] = -float('inf')
    else:
        dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `path` is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*', and `path` must have at least 3 elements. `n` is the length of `path` and must be greater than 2. `dp` is a list of integers with `n` elements where `dp[0]` is 1 if `path[0]` is '@' otherwise `-inf`, `dp[1]` is `-inf` if `path[0]` is '*' or `path[1]` is '*', otherwise 2 if `path[1]` is '@' or 1 if `path[1]` is '*'. For `dp[i]`, if `path[i]` is '*', then `dp[i]` is `-float('inf')`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` is `max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)`. All other `dp[j]` for `j` from 2 to `i-1` and `i+1` to `n-1` remain 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `path` is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*', and `path` must have at least 3 elements. `n` is the length of `path` and must be greater than 2. `dp` is a list of integers with `n` elements where `dp[0]` is 1 if `path[0]` is '@' otherwise `-inf`, `dp[1]` is `-inf` if `path[0]` is '*' or `path[1]` is '*', otherwise 2 if `path[1]` is '@' or 1 if `path[1]` is '*'. For `dp[i]`, if `path[i]` is '*', then `dp[i]` is `-float('inf')`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` is `max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)`. If `path[i]` is '*', `dp[i]` is explicitly set to `-float('inf')`. All other `dp[j]` for `j` from 2 to `i-1` and `i+1` to `n-1` remain 0. `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `path` is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*', and `path` must have at least 3 elements. `n` is the length of `path` and must be greater than 2. `dp` is a list of integers with `n` elements where `dp[0]` is 1 if `path[0]` is '@' otherwise `-inf`, `dp[1]` is `-inf` if `path[0]` is '*' or `path[1]` is '*', otherwise 2 if `path[1]` is '@' or 1 if `path[1]` is '*', `dp[2]` and `dp[3]` follow the same rules as described. If `path[4]` is '*', then `dp[4]` is `-float('inf')`. Otherwise, `dp[4]` is `max(dp[3], dp[2]) + 1` if `path[4]` is '@' otherwise `dp[4]`. All other `dp[j]` for `j` from 5 to `n-1` remain 0. `i` is 4.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
