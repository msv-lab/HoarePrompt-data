### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the issues in the provided code and confirm why it does not solve the problem as described.

#### Problem Description Recap:
The problem requires determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicity of each sign. Specifically, the signs must occur sequentially, meaning the i-th sign must occur strictly after the (i-1)-th sign.

#### Code Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function appears to be designed to process a string (`path`) and count occurrences of a specific character ('@') while avoiding another character ('*').
   - It uses dynamic programming to keep track of counts but does not handle periodicity or sequential occurrence of events, which is central to the problem.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, splits it into test cases, and processes each test case using `func_1`.
   - The input parsing is flawed because it treats the entire sequence of numbers as a single "path" rather than separate test cases with their own sequences of periodicities.

#### Issues Identified:
- **Misinterpretation of Input**: The code reads the entire input as a single string and does not correctly parse multiple test cases. Each test case should consist of a number `n` followed by `n` integers representing the periodicities of the signs.
- **Incorrect Logic**: The logic in `func_1` is unrelated to the problem. It counts characters in a string rather than calculating the occurrence years based on periodicity.
- **Lack of Periodicity Handling**: The code does not implement the necessary logic to calculate the year in which each sign occurs based on its periodicity and the requirement that signs must occur sequentially.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Parse the input to handle multiple test cases.
2. For each test case, iterate through the list of periodicities.
3. Track the current year and update it based on the periodicity of each sign, ensuring that each subsequent sign occurs strictly after the previous one.

#### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the original assessment is correct. The provided code does not solve the problem as described and contains significant logical errors.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
