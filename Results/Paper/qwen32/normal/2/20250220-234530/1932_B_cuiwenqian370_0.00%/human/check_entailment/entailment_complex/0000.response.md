Reasoning: 

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem described. Here's why:

1. **Function `func_1` Misinterpretation**: The function `func_1` is designed to handle a sequence of characters ('@' and '*') and calculate a score based on that sequence. However, the problem requires handling a sequence of integers representing the periodicity of signs. The function `func_1` is completely irrelevant to the problem at hand.

2. **Function `func_2` Misinterpretation**: The function `func_2` is supposed to read multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then processes these integers to determine the year in which the nth sign will occur. However, `func_2` incorrectly calls `func_1` with the string representation of the list of integers instead of processing them to find the correct year.

3. **Logic for Finding the Year of the Nth Sign**: The correct approach involves iterating through the list of periodicities and calculating the next occurrence of each sign sequentially. For each sign, we need to find the next multiple of its periodicity that is greater than the year of the previous sign's occurrence. This logic is not implemented in the provided code.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
