The code snippet `n = int(data[index])` assigns the integer value of the element at index `3` in the list `data` to the variable `n`. Given that `index` is `3`, the element at this index in `data` is `'a_3'`. However, the problem statement specifies that `n` is the integer value of `a_2`, which implies that `data[1]` (since indexing starts from 0) should be `'a_2'`. This suggests there might be a discrepancy in the provided information or an expectation that `index` should point to `a_2` instead of `a_3`.

Assuming the intention is to set `n` to the integer value derived from `a_2`, and considering `data[1]` is `'a_2'`, the integer value of `'a_2'` cannot be directly determined without additional context. However, based on the given information and assuming `data[index]` is indeed `'a_3'`, the code will attempt to convert `'a_3'` to an integer, which will raise a `ValueError` because `'a_3'` is not a valid integer string.

Given the problem constraints and assuming the code executes without error (which it wouldn't in reality due to the conversion issue), if we hypothetically consider `data[1]` (i.e., `'a_2'`) to be the intended target and it holds a valid integer string, let's proceed with the assumption that `data[1]` is something like `'2'` for the sake of this exercise.

Thus, if `data[1]` were `'2'` and `index` was correctly pointing to `a_2`, `n` would be `2`.

However, since the code as written points to `data[3]` which is `'a_3'`, and assuming no error handling, the code would fail. But for the purpose of this task, we will assume the intention was to correctly point to `a_2`.

Output State: **`path` is `'a_3'`; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `data` is a list of strings ['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']; `t` must be greater than 0 and is now `t - 1`; `index` is 3; `results` is `[func_1('a_3')]`; `n` is the integer value of `a_2`.** 

If hypothetically `data[1]` (i.e., `a_2`) were `'2'`, then `n` would be `2`. But since the code points to `data[3]` which is `'a_3'`, this would normally cause an error. For the sake of this task, we assume the intention was to point to `a_2`.
