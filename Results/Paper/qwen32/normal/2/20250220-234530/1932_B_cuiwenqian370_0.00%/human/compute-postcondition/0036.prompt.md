You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: path is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*', representing different conditions in a sequence.
def func_1(path):
    n = len(path)
    if (n == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: `path` is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*', and `n` is the length of `path`. `n` is greater than 0
    dp = [0] * n
    if (path[0] == '@') :
        dp[0] = 1
    else :
        if (path[0] == '*') :
            dp[0] = -float('inf')
        #State: `path` is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*', and `n` is the length of `path`. `n` is greater than 0; `dp` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where the first element is `-inf` if the condition `path[0] == '*'` is true, and the rest are initialized to 0. The first element of `path` is '*'.
    #State: `path` is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*', and `n` is the length of `path`. `n` is greater than 0. `dp` is a list of integers with `n` elements. If the first character of `path` is '@', the first element of `dp` is 1 and the rest are 0. If the first character of `path` is '*', the first element of `dp` is `-inf` and the rest are 0.
    if (n > 1) :
        if (path[1] == '*') :
            dp[1] = -float('inf')
        else :
            dp[1] = dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)
        #State: `path` is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*', and `n` is the length of `path`. `n` is greater than 1. `dp` is a list of integers with `n` elements. If the first character of `path` is '@', the first element of `dp` is 1. If the second character of `path` is '*', the second element of `dp` is `-inf`; otherwise, it is 2 if the second character of `path` is '@' or 1 if the second character of `path` is '*'. If the first character of `path` is '*', the first element of `dp` is `-inf`. The second element of `dp` is `-inf` regardless of the second character of `path`. The rest of the elements in `dp` are 0.
    #State: `path` is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*', and `n` is the length of `path`. `n` is greater than 0. `dp` is a list of integers with `n` elements. If `n` is 1, `dp` remains unchanged as per the precondition. If `n` is greater than 1, the first element of `dp` is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', otherwise it is `-inf`. The second element of `dp` is `-inf` if the first character of `path` is '*', or if the second character of `path` is '*'; otherwise, it is 2 if the second character of `path` is '@' or 1 if the second character of `path` is '*'. The rest of the elements in `dp` are 0.
    for i in range(2, n):
        if path[i] == '*':
            dp[i] = -float('inf')
        else:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)
        
    #State: `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 1 if `path[0]` is '@' otherwise `-inf`, `dp[1]` is `-inf` if `path[0]` is '*' or `path[1]` is '*', otherwise 2 if `path[1]` is '@' or 1 if `path[1]` is '*', and for each `i` from 2 to `n-1`, `dp[i]` is `-inf` if `path[i]` is '*', otherwise `max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + 1` if `path[i]` is '@' or `max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2])` if `path[i]` is '*'.
    return max(x for x in dp if x > -float('inf'))
    #The program returns the maximum value in the `dp` list that is greater than `-inf`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `path`, which is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*'. The function returns 0 if a certain condition is met (which is not detailed here). Otherwise, it returns the maximum value in the `dp` list that is greater than `-inf`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value in the `dp` list that is greater than `-inf`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
