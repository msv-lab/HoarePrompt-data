Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

# Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: path is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*', representing different conditions in a sequence.

        #State: `path` is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*', and `n` is the length of `path`. `n` is greater than 0; `dp` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where the first element is `-inf` if the condition `path[0] == '*'` is true, and the rest are initialized to 0. The first element of `path` is '*'.
    #State: `path` is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*', and `n` is the length of `path`. `n` is greater than 0. `dp` is a list of integers with `n` elements. If the first character of `path` is '@', the first element of `dp` is 1 and the rest are 0. If the first character of `path` is '*', the first element of `dp` is `-inf` and the rest are 0.
    if (n > 1) :
        if (path[1] == '*') :

If the first character of `path` is '@', the first element of `dp` is 1. If the second character of `path` is '*', the second element of `dp` is `-inf`; otherwise, it is 2 if the second character of `path` is '@' or 1 if the second character of `path` is '*'. If the first character of `path` is '*', the first element of `dp` is `-inf`. The second element of `dp` is `-inf` regardless of the second character of `path`. The rest of the elements in `dp` are 0.
    #State: `path` is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*', and `n` is the length of `path`. `n` is greater than 0. `dp` is a list of integers with `n` elements. If `n` is 1, `dp` remains unchanged as per the precondition. If `n` is greater than 1, the first element of `dp` is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', otherwise it is `-inf`. The second element of `dp` is `-inf` if the first character of `path` is '*', or if the second character of `path` is '*'; otherwise, it is 2 if the second character of `path` is '@' or 1 if the second character of `path` is '*'. The rest of the elements in `dp` are 0.
    for i in range(2, n):
        if path[i] == '*':
            dp[i] = -float('inf')
        else:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)
        
    #State: `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 1 if `path[0]` is '@' otherwise `-inf`, `dp[1]` is `-inf` if `path[0]` is '*' or `path[1]` is '*', otherwise 2 if `path[1]` is '@' or 1 if `path[1]` is '*', and for each `i` from 2 to `n-1`, `dp[i]` is `-inf` if `path[i]` is '*', otherwise `max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + 1` if `path[i]` is '@' or `max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2])` if `path[i]` is '*'.
    return max(x for x in dp if x > -float('inf'))
    #The program returns the maximum value in the `dp` list that is greater than `-inf`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of characters `path` where each character is either '@' or '*'. It returns 0 if the list is empty. Otherwise, it calculates a score based on the sequence of characters, where '@' contributes positively to the score and '*' results in a score of negative infinity for that position. The function returns the highest possible score from the sequence, ignoring any positions with a score of negative infinity.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: path is a string representing space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        path = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        results.append(func_1(path))
        
    #State: `path` is `'a_{1+2*t}'`; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `data` is a list of strings ['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `index` is `1 + 2*t`; `results` is `[func_1('a_3'), func_1('a_5'), ..., func_1('a_{1+2*(t-1)})]`.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `path` is `'a_{1+2*t}'`, `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function, `data` is a list of strings `['1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']`, `t` is `1`, `index` is `3`, `results` is `[func_1('a_3'), func_1('a_5')]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, which consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` followed by a string `path` containing `n` space-separated integers. For each test case, it processes the `path` using `func_1` and prints the result.
