The only variable in the loop head is `result`. The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state of `results` and how the loop progresses.

Given:
- `results` is `[func_1('a_3'), func_1('a_4')]`
- The loop is currently processing the second element of `results` (since `results` has two elements and the loop has already processed the first one).

For the loop to execute one more time, there should be another element in `results` to process. However, based on the provided state, `results` only contains two elements. Therefore, no further iterations will occur unless `results` is modified to include additional elements.

Since we are only allowed to adjust the states of objects in the loop head (`result`), and since `result` is determined by the current element being processed in `results`, we cannot directly change `result` to make the loop execute again without changing `results`.

However, if we assume that the task is to describe the state as it would be if there were another element to process, we can describe the hypothetical next state:

State: **`path` is `'a_{1+2*t}'`, `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function, `data` is a list of strings `['1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']`, `t` is `1`, `index` is `3`, `results` is `[func_1('a_3'), func_1('a_4'), func_1('a_new_element')]`**

In this hypothetical state, `results` has an additional element, allowing the loop to execute one more time. But based on the given state, no further iterations will occur.

So, strictly adhering to the given state without making assumptions about modifying `results`:

State: **`path` is `'a_{1+2*t}'`, `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function, `data` is a list of strings `['1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']`, `t` is `1`, `index` is `3`, `results` is `[func_1('a_3'), func_1('a_4')]`**

No further iterations will occur with the current state of `results`.
