Postcondition: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters where `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing three elements, all of which are the digit `char`, and `letters` is an empty list. Otherwise, `digits` is an empty list and `letters` is a list containing one more element, which is `char`.**
