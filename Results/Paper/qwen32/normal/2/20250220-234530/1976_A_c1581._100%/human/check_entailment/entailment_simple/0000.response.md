### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided program and check whether it correctly implements the conditions for a strong password as per the problem statement.

1. **Separation of Digits and Letters**: The function `func_1` separates the digits and letters into two different lists (`digits` and `letters`). This step is correct.

2. **Sorting**: Both the `digits` and `letters` lists are sorted in non-decreasing order. This step is also correct.

3. **Checking Conditions**:
   - The function checks if the digits are sorted in non-decreasing order. However, this check is redundant because the `digits` list has already been sorted.
   - The function then checks if the last digit is less than or equal to every letter in the `letters` list. This ensures that no digit comes after a letter in the original password, which is one of the conditions for a strong password.
   
4. **Reconstruction and Comparison**:
   - The function reconstructs the password by concatenating the sorted `digits` list and the sorted `letters` list.
   - It then compares this reconstructed password with the original password. If they match, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Issues in the Program:

- **Redundant Check**: The loop checking if `digits[i] > digits[i + 1]` is unnecessary because the `digits` list is already sorted.
- **Condition Check**: The loop checking if `digits[-1] > letters[i]` ensures that the last digit is not greater than any letter, but it doesn't ensure that no digit comes after a letter in the original password. This check alone is insufficient because it only compares the last digit with all letters, not the sequence of characters in the original password.
- **Sequence Check**: The function does not explicitly check if the sequence of characters in the original password follows the rules (all letters followed by all digits, both sorted). The comparison with the reconstructed password does implicitly check this, but the logic is not clear and could be improved for clarity.

### Correctness:

Despite the issues mentioned, the program seems to work correctly based on the provided examples. The comparison with the reconstructed password effectively checks all the required conditions. However, the logic can be improved for better readability and correctness.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct based on the given examples and the implicit checks performed. Therefore, the answer is:

**Correctness: True**
