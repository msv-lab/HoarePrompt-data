You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program: 
testCases = int(input())
while testCases:
    length = int(input())
    password = input()
    print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')
    testCases -= 1

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if sortedPassword == password:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Annotated Code: 
testCases = int(input())
while testCases:
    length = int(input())
    password = input()
    print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')
    testCases -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string consisting of exactly n characters where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
        
    #State: `digits` contains all the digits from the `password`, and `letters` contains all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password`.
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
        
    #State: The function completes all iterations without returning False, indicating that the digits are sorted in ascending order and the last digit is not greater than any letter in the letters list.
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if (sortedPassword == password) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. Passwords should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. No digit should come after a letter.
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Program Analysis:
1. The program reads the number of test cases and iterates through each one.
2. For each password, it separates the digits and letters into two lists (`digits` and `letters`).
3. It sorts both lists individually.
4. It checks if the digits list is sorted in non-decreasing order (though this check is redundant since the list is already sorted).
5. It checks if the last digit is less than or equal to the first letter (if both exist). This ensures that no digit comes after a letter.
6. It concatenates the sorted digits and letters and compares this with the original password.
7. If the concatenated sorted string matches the original password, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Issues in the Program:
- The program does not correctly handle the requirement that no digit should come after a letter. It only checks if the last digit is less than or equal to the first letter, which is insufficient. For example, in the case of "a1b2", the program would incorrectly consider it valid because '1' < 'b'.
- The program does not ensure that the digits and letters are in their respective sorted positions within the original password. It only checks if the concatenated sorted string matches the original password, which does not guarantee that the digits are followed by letters and both are in sorted order.

### Correct Approach:
- We need to ensure that all digits appear before any letters in the password.
- We need to check that the digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- We need to check that the letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- We can achieve this by iterating through the password once and checking these conditions.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the problem requirements.
