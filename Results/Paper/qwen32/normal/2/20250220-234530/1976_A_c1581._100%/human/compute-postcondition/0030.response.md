Postcondition: **`digits` contains at least one digit, `letters` contains all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` sorted in ascending order, `i` is 1. If `i` is less than the length of `letters` and `digits[-1]` is greater than `letters[i]`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return and continues executing.**
