### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the function `func_1` to see if it correctly implements the conditions for a strong password as described in the problem statement.

1. **Separation of Digits and Letters**:
   - The function iterates through each character in the password and separates them into two lists: `digits` and `letters`. This part is correct.

2. **Sorting**:
   - Both `digits` and `letters` are sorted in ascending order. This part also meets the requirements.

3. **Checking Conditions**:
   - The function then checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order, which is inherently ensured by the sorting step.
   - The function checks if the last digit is less than or equal to every letter. This ensures that no digit comes after a letter in the original password, which is one of the conditions.
   - However, the loop for checking the condition `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:` has a logical flaw. It incorrectly assumes that there will always be at least one digit and one letter. If there are no digits, `digits[-1]` will raise an `IndexError`. Additionally, the loop logic is flawed because it compares the last digit with every letter, which is unnecessary and incorrect. Instead, it should ensure that all letters come after all digits, and that the digits and letters themselves are sorted.

4. **Reconstruction and Comparison**:
   - The function reconstructs the password by concatenating the sorted `digits` and `letters` and checks if it matches the original password. This step ensures that the password is in the correct format (all digits followed by all letters, both sorted).

### Issues Identified:
- The function does not handle cases where there are no digits or no letters correctly.
- The loop logic for comparing the last digit with every letter is incorrect and can lead to errors.

### Corrected Approach:
To fix the issues, we need to ensure that:
- The function handles cases where there are no digits or no letters.
- The function correctly checks that all letters come after all digits.

Here is a corrected version of the function:
```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    
    # Check if all digits come before any letters and both are sorted
    if all(char.isdigit() for char in password[:len(digits)]) and all(char.isalpha() for char in password[len(digits):]):
        return password == ''.join(digits + letters)
    else:
        return False
```

### Conclusion:
Given the original function `func_1` as provided, it does not correctly handle all edge cases and has logical flaws. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
