Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters where `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`, `char` is `next_char`, `digits` is a list that now includes `next_char` as its last element.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `digits` has been updated to include the character stored in `char` (which is `next_char`). All other variables retain their original values and constraints.
