### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to ensure it meets the problem requirements.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password (`n`) and the password itself.

2. **Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` separates the password into two lists: one for digits and one for letters.
   - Both lists are then sorted individually.
   - The function checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order. This check is redundant because the list is already sorted.
   - The function then checks if the last digit in the sorted digits list is less than or equal to every letter in the sorted letters list. This ensures that no digit comes after a letter in the original password.
   - Finally, it constructs a new password by concatenating the sorted digits and letters and compares it to the original password. If they match, it means the original password was already sorted according to the rules, and the function returns `True`.

3. **Conditions Verification:**
   - The program correctly checks that all digits come before any letters.
   - It verifies that all digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It ensures that no digit appears after a letter in the original password.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints "YES" if the password meets all the conditions, otherwise "NO".

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine if a password is strong according to Monocarp's criteria. The execution summary aligns with the intended functionality, and the code handles all specified conditions.

### Correctness: **True**
