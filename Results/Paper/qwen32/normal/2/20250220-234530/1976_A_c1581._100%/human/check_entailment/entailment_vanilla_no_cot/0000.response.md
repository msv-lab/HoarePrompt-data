Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the length of the password and then the password itself.
- It calls `func_1(password)` to check if the password meets the criteria.
- The function `func_1` separates the digits and letters into two lists.
- It sorts both lists.
- It checks if the digits list is sorted (though this is redundant since we just sorted it).
- It checks if the last digit is less than or equal to the first letter (if both exist).
- It constructs a new password from the sorted digits and letters.
- It compares the constructed password with the original password and returns `True` if they match, otherwise `False`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Redundant Sorting Check**: After sorting the digits and letters, the program checks if the digits list is sorted again. This is unnecessary because the list has already been sorted.
2. **Digit-Letter Order Check**: The program checks if the last digit is less than or equal to the first letter. However, this does not ensure that there are no digits after any letters in the original password. It only checks the relative order of the last digit and the first letter.
3. **Constructing Sorted Password**: The program constructs a new password by concatenating the sorted digits and letters. However, this does not account for the requirement that no digit can come after a letter in the original password. The constructed password will always be sorted, but it doesn't reflect the original order constraint.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure:
- Digits are sorted and come before any letters.
- Letters are sorted and come after all digits.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    # Find the first occurrence of a letter
    first_letter_index = next((i for i, c in enumerate(password) if c.isalpha()), len(password))
    
    # Check if all digits are sorted and come before any letters
    digits = password[:first_letter_index]
    if digits != ''.join(sorted(digits)):
        return False
    
    # Check if all letters are sorted
    letters = password[first_letter_index:]
    if letters != ''.join(sorted(letters)):
        return False
    
    return True
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
