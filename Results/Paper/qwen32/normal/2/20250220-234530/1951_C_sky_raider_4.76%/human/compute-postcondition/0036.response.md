The value of `k` is decremented by `s`, where `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `k` is `k - s`**.

In natural language, this means that `i` remains `i + 1`, `n` still must be greater than `i + 1`, `s` is the smaller of `m` and `k`, and `k` has been reduced by the value of `s`.
