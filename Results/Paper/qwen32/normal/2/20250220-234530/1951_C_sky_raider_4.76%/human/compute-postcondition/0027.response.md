The value of `s` is updated to be the minimum of `m` and `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `m` is the second integer from the input; `k` is reduced by the total `s` accumulated over all iterations; `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input; `s` is `min(m, k)`; `c` is `k * k / 2`; `i` is `i + 1`**
