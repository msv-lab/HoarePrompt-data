Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `m` and `k` are integers read from the input, with `k` being `k - s`
- `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input
- `s` is the smaller of `m` and `k`
- `c` is `k * k / 2`

Code Snippet:
```python
c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2
```

Impact of the Code:
- The variable `c` is updated by adding the result of the expression `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` to its current value.

Since `c` was initially `k * k / 2`, the new value of `c` will be:
\[ c_{\text{new}} = \frac{k^2}{2} + l[i] \cdot s - \frac{s^2}{2} \]

Other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0; `m` and `k` are integers read from the input, with `k` being `k - s`; `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `s` is the smaller of `m` and `k`; `c` is \(\frac{k^2}{2} + l[i] \cdot s - \frac{s^2}{2}\).**
