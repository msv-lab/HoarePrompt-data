Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `low` is set according to the logic (either `mid + 1` or `0`), `high` is set according to the logic (either `min(n, b)` or `(min(n, b)) // 2 - 1`), `low <= high` holds true, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`**

Natural Language: The value of `profit_next` is now set to the result of calling `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
