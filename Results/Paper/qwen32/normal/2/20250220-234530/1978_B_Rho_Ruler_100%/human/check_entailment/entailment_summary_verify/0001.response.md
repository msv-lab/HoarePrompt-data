Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its correctness based on the problem description, the code, and the function summaries.

### Problem Recap

Bob wants to maximize his profit by selling `n` buns. He can sell the first `k` buns at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b-k+1`, and the remaining `n-k` buns at a fixed price `a`. We need to find the maximum profit Bob can achieve.

### Code Analysis

#### `func_1(k, n, a, b)`

This function calculates the profit for a given `k`:
\[ \text{profit} = k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \]

- **First Term**: \( k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} \)
  - This term calculates the sum of the series \( b + (b-1) + (b-2) + \ldots + (b-k+1) \).
  - The sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time is indeed \( k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} \).

- **Second Term**: \( (n - k) \times a \)
  - This term calculates the profit from selling the remaining `n-k` buns at the usual price `a`.

Thus, `func_1` correctly computes the profit for a given `k`.

#### `func_2(n, a, b)`

This function performs a binary search to find the value of `k` that maximizes the profit.

- **Initialization**: `low` is set to 0 and `high` to \(\min(n, b)\).
- **Binary Search**: The loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`.
  - For each midpoint `mid`, it calculates the profit for `mid` and `mid + 1`.
  - If the profit for `mid + 1` is greater, it moves the search to the right half (`low = mid + 1`).
  - Otherwise, it moves to the left half (`high = mid - 1`).
  - It keeps track of the maximum profit encountered.

The binary search approach is appropriate because the profit function is unimodal (it increases to a peak and then decreases), making binary search an efficient method to find the maximum.

### Function Summary

The function summary for `func_2` indicates that it calculates and returns the maximum profit by selling `n` buns with the first `b` buns at a modified price and the rest at a usual price `a`. This aligns with the problem description and the implementation.

### Verification

Given the analysis above, both `func_1` and `func_2` appear to be correctly implemented and logically sound. The binary search efficiently finds the optimal `k` within the constraints.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the maximum profit Bob can achieve by selling the buns under the given conditions.

**Final: True**
