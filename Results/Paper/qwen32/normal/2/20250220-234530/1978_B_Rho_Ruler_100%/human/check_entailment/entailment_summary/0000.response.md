### Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the program, we need to ensure that the functions `func_1` and `func_2` together correctly compute the maximum profit Bob can achieve under the given conditions.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: Calculate the profit for a given `k`, which represents the number of buns sold at the modified price.
- **Formula**: 
  - The first `k` buns are sold at prices from `b` down to `b-k+1`. The sum of these prices can be computed using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \( k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} \).
  - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
  - Therefore, the total profit is \( k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \).

This formula is correctly implemented in `func_1`.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: Determine the maximum profit by iterating over possible values of `k` and finding the one that maximizes the profit.
- **Approach**:
  - It uses binary search to efficiently find the value of `k` that maximizes the profit.
  - The search range for `k` is from 0 to `min(n, b)`, as `k` cannot exceed the number of buns `n` or the initial price `b`.
  - For each midpoint `mid` in the binary search, it calculates the profit for `mid` and `mid + 1` using `func_1`.
  - It updates the `max_profit` with the higher of the two profits.
  - Depending on whether the profit for `mid + 1` is greater than the profit for `mid`, it adjusts the search range (`low` or `high`) to continue searching in the direction of increasing profit.

This approach ensures that the function finds the optimal `k` efficiently.

### Conclusion:
Both functions are correctly implemented according to the problem description and their intended purposes. The combination of these functions should yield the correct maximum profit for each test case.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
