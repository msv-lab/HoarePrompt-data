To determine if the given program correctly solves the problem, we need to analyze both functions `func_1` and `func_2`.

### Function Analysis

#### `func_1(k, n, a, b)`
This function calculates the profit for a given value of `k`, where `k` is the number of buns sold at the modified price. The formula used is:
\[ \text{profit} = k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \]

- \( k \times b \): This part calculates the total revenue from selling the first `k` buns at the modified prices. The price for the i-th bun is \( b - i + 1 \). Summing up these prices for \( i \) from 1 to \( k \) gives us \( k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} \).
- \( (n - k) \times a \): This part calculates the total revenue from selling the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price \( a \).

#### `func_2(n, a, b)`
This function finds the maximum profit by performing a binary search over the possible values of `k` (from 0 to \(\min(n, b)\)).

- It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to \(\min(n, b)\).
- It iteratively narrows down the range `[low, high]` using binary search to find the value of `k` that maximizes the profit.
- For each midpoint `mid` in the current range, it calculates the profit for `mid` and `mid + 1`.
- If the profit for `mid + 1` is greater than the profit for `mid`, it means the maximum profit lies in the right half, so it updates `low` to `mid + 1`.
- Otherwise, it updates `high` to `mid - 1`.
- It keeps track of the maximum profit found during the search.

### Correctness Verification

The approach taken by the program is correct because:
1. The formula in `func_1` correctly calculates the profit for any given `k`.
2. The binary search in `func_2` efficiently finds the value of `k` that maximizes the profit within the range `[0, \min(n, b)]`.

The binary search ensures that the solution is optimal and runs in \( O(\log(\min(n, b))) \) time per test case, which is efficient given the constraints (\( t \leq 10^4 \), \( n, a, b \leq 10^9 \)).

### Conclusion

The given program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
