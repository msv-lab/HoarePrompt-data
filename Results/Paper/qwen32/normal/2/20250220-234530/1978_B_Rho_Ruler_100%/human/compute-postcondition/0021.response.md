The code snippet recalculates the value of `mid` using the formula `(low + high) // 2`. This means `mid` is now set to the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, `high`, `profit_mid`, `profit_next`, and `max_profit`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers; `low` and `high` are adjusted such that `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`; `profit_mid` and `profit_next` are the results of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` and `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)` respectively; `max_profit` is the maximum of its previous value and `profit_mid`.**
