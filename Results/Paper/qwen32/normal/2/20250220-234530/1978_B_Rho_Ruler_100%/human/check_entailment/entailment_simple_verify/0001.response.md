### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program's correctness based on the provided annotations and the problem description.

#### Function Analysis

##### `func_1(k, n, a, b)`
- **Purpose**: Calculate the profit for a given value of `k`, where `k` is the number of buns sold at the modified price.
- **Formula**: 
  \[
  \text{profit} = k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a
  \]
- **Explanation**:
  - \( k \times b \): Total revenue from selling the first `k` buns at modified prices.
  - \( \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} \): This term adjusts the sum of the arithmetic series \( b + (b-1) + (b-2) + \ldots + (b-k+1) \) to the correct value.
  - \( (n - k) \times a \): Total revenue from selling the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price \( a \).

The formula is correctly implemented and matches the problem's requirements.

##### `func_2(n, a, b)`
- **Purpose**: Find the maximum profit by performing a binary search over the possible values of `k` (from 0 to \(\min(n, b)\)).
- **Binary Search Logic**:
  - Initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to \(\min(n, b)\).
  - Iteratively narrow down the range `[low, high]` using binary search.
  - For each midpoint `mid`, calculate the profit for `mid` and `mid + 1`.
  - Adjust `low` and `high` based on the comparison between `profit_mid` and `profit_next`.
  - Track the maximum profit found during the search.

The binary search logic is sound and ensures that the optimal `k` is found efficiently.

#### Correctness Verification

- **Formula in `func_1`**: The formula correctly computes the profit for any given `k`. This has been validated by the annotations.
- **Binary Search in `func_2`**: The binary search algorithm efficiently finds the value of `k` that maximizes the profit within the range `[0, \min(n, b)]`. The annotations confirm that the search correctly updates `low` and `high` and tracks the maximum profit.

Given the constraints (\( t \leq 10^4 \), \( n, a, b \leq 10^9 \)), the binary search approach is efficient and feasible.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Both `func_1` and `func_2` are accurately designed and executed according to the problem description.

**Final: True**
