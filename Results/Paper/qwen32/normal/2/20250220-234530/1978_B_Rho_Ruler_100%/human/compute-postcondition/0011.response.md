Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of buns, `a` is a positive integer representing the usual price of a bun, and `b` is a positive integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price. If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, then `low` is set to `mid + 1` and `high` remains `min(n, b)`. Otherwise, `low` remains 0 and `high` is set to `(min(n, b)) // 2 - 1`. In both cases, `max_profit` is `max(0, profit_mid)`, `mid` is `(min(n, b)) // 2`, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, and `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`.**
