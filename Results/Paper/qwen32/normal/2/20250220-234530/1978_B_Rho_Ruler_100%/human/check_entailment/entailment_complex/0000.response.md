### Reasoning:

To solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum profit Bob can make by selling his buns under the given promotion rules. The key is to find the optimal number of buns \( k \) to sell at the modified price, which maximizes the total profit.

#### Breakdown of the Solution:

1. **Understanding the Profit Calculation**:
   - For a given \( k \), the profit from selling the first \( k \) buns at the modified price is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Profit}_{\text{modified}} = k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2}
     \]
     This formula accounts for the decreasing price of each subsequent bun.
   - The profit from selling the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price \( a \) is:
     \[
     \text{Profit}_{\text{usual}} = (n - k) \times a
     \]
   - Therefore, the total profit for a given \( k \) is:
     \[
     \text{Total Profit} = k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a
     \]

2. **Binary Search Approach**:
   - To find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the total profit, we use a binary search approach over the range \( [0, \min(n, b)] \).
   - We calculate the profit for the middle point \( \text{mid} \) and compare it with the profit for \( \text{mid} + 1 \).
   - If the profit for \( \text{mid} + 1 \) is higher, it means increasing \( k \) might yield a higher profit, so we move the lower bound up.
   - Otherwise, we move the upper bound down.
   - The process continues until the lower bound exceeds the upper bound, at which point the maximum profit found is returned.

3. **Correctness of the Implementation**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly computes the total profit for a given \( k \) using the formula derived above.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function uses binary search to efficiently find the \( k \) that maximizes the profit. It initializes the search range correctly and updates the bounds based on the comparison of profits.
   - The main loop in `func_2` ensures that the search space is reduced systematically, and the maximum profit is tracked throughout the process.

Given the above analysis, the implementation correctly addresses the problem requirements and efficiently finds the optimal solution within the constraints.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
