Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `low` is set according to the logic (either `mid + 1` or `0`), `high` is set according to the logic (either `min(n, b)` or `(min(n, b)) // 2 - 1`), `low <= high` holds true, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`**

Natural Language: After executing the code, the variable `profit_mid` is assigned the value returned by the function `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`. All other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, `high`, and `mid`) retain their initial values and conditions.
