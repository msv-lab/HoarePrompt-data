Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of buns, `a` is a positive integer representing the usual price of a bun, and `b` is a positive integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price; `low` is 0, `high` is `min(n, b)`; `max_profit` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while low <= high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)
    profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)
    max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)
    if profit_next > profit_mid:
        low = mid + 1
    else:
        high = mid - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of buns, `a` is a positive integer representing the usual price of a bun, and `b` is a positive integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price. If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, then `low` is set to `mid + 1` and `high` remains `min(n, b)`. Otherwise, `low` remains 0 and `high` is set to `(min(n, b)) // 2 - 1`. In both cases, `max_profit` is `max(0, profit_mid)`, `mid` is `(min(n, b)) // 2`, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, and `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers. `low` and `high` are adjusted based on the comparison between `profit_next` and `profit_mid`. If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, `low` is set to `mid + 1` and `high` remains as either `min(n, b)` or `(min(n, b)) // 2 - 1`. Otherwise, `low` is set according to the logic (either `mid + 1` or `0`) and `high` is set to `mid - 1`. `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`. `profit_mid` and `profit_next` are the results of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` and `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)` respectively. `max_profit` is the maximum of its previous value and `profit_mid`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers; `low` and `high` are adjusted such that `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`; `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`; `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`; `max_profit` is the maximum of its previous value and `profit_mid`. If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
