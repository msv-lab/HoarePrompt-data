### Reasoning:

The given problem requires determining the maximum profit Bob can achieve by selling `n` buns with a promotional pricing strategy. The strategy involves setting a value `k` where the first `k` buns are sold at decreasing prices starting from `b` down to `(b - k + 1)`, and the remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

Let's break down the solution:

1. **Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the total profit for a given `k`.
   - It computes the profit from the first `k` buns using the formula `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2`. This formula arises because the prices for the first `k` buns form an arithmetic series: `b, (b-1), ..., (b-k+1)`. The sum of this series is `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2`.
   - It then adds the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price `a`, which is `(n - k) * a`.
   - Thus, the total profit for a given `k` is `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.

2. **Function `func_2(n, a, b)`**:
   - This function determines the maximum profit across all possible values of `k` (from `0` to `min(n, b)`).
   - It uses binary search to efficiently find the value of `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - The binary search iteratively narrows down the range `[low, high]` by comparing the profit at the midpoint `mid` with the profit at `mid + 1`.
   - If the profit at `mid + 1` is greater than the profit at `mid`, it means the maximum profit lies in the higher half, so `low` is updated to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, the maximum profit lies in the lower half, so `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.
   - The maximum profit found during this process is returned.

### Verification:
- The logic in both functions correctly implements the required calculations and optimization strategy.
- The use of binary search in `func_2` ensures that the solution is efficient even for large input sizes (`n, a, b â‰¤ 10^9`).

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly solves the problem by calculating the maximum profit Bob can obtain from selling the buns under the given promotional strategy.

**Correctness: True**
