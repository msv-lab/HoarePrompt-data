The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration of the loop. However, since there is no loop structure provided in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any of the variables or the program flow in this context.

Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `cases`, `unique_a`, `unique_b`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, `only_a`, `both`, `only_b`, `total_distinct`, `results`) are modified by the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `cases` is `[(3, 4, 2, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7])]`, `unique_a` is `{1, 2, 3}`, `unique_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_a` is `{x for x in unique_a if x <= k}`, `relevant_b` is `{x for x in {4, 5, 6, 7} if x <= k}`, `only_a` is `relevant_a - relevant_b`, `both` is `set()`, `only_b` is `{x for x in {4, 5, 6, 7} if x <= k} - {x for x in unique_a if x <= k}`, `total_distinct` is `len(only_b) + 4`, `results` is `['NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES', 'NO']`.**
