Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

- `t` is 1
- `cases` is `[(3, 4, 2, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7])]`
- `results` is `[]`
- `unique_a` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`
- `unique_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`
- `relevant_a` is `{x for x in unique_a if x <= k}` (Note: `k` is not defined in the initial state, so `relevant_a` remains undefined)
- `relevant_b` is `{x for x in {4, 5, 6, 7} if x <= k}` (Similarly, `relevant_b` remains undefined due to `k` being undefined)
- `only_a` is `{x for x in relevant_a if x not in relevant_b}` (This also remains undefined)

The code snippet provided is:
```python
only_b = relevant_b - relevant_a
```

Since `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` are both dependent on the undefined variable `k`, their values cannot be determined. Consequently, `only_b` cannot be computed with the given information.

However, if we assume that `k` is such that `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` can be determined, the output state would reflect the computation of `only_b` based on those sets.

For the sake of providing a concrete example, let's assume `k` is large enough such that `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` both equal `{4, 5, 6, 7}`. In this case:

- `relevant_a` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`
- `relevant_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`
- `only_b` would be `{4, 5, 6, 7} - {4, 5, 6, 7}`, which results in an empty set `set()`.

Given this assumption, the Output State would be:

Output State: **`t` is 1, `cases` is `[(3, 4, 2, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7])]`, `results` is `[]`, `unique_a` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `unique_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_a` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `only_a` is `{x for x in relevant_a if x not in relevant_b}`, `only_b` is `set()`**

In natural language: The value of `only_b` is now an empty set, while all other variables retain their initial values or remain undefined as per the initial state assumptions.
