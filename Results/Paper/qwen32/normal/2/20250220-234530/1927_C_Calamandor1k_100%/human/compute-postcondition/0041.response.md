The given code snippet appends the string `'YES'` to a list named `results`. However, the initial state does not include any information about the `results` list. Since the code modifies the `results` list, we will include it in the output state.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `cases` is `[(3, 4, 2, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7])]`, `unique_a` is `{1, 2, 3}`, `unique_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_a` is `{1, 2}`, `relevant_b` is `set()`, `only_a` is `{1, 2}`, `both` is `set()`, `only_b` is `set()`, `total_distinct` is 2, `results` is `['YES']`.**
This means that all the previously mentioned variables retain their original values, and a new list `results` has been created containing the single element `'YES'`.
