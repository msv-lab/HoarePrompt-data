The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the variables or their values; it simply moves the control back to the top of the loop for the next iteration.

Given that there is no loop in the provided context, the `continue` statement here would have no effect on the flow or the values of the variables. Therefore, none of the variables will be altered.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `cases` is `[(5, 6, 3, [8, 9, 10], [11, 12, 13, 14])]`, `n` is 5, `m` is 6, `k` is 3, `a` is `[8, 9, 10]`, `b` is `[11, 12, 13, 14]`, `unique_a` is `{8, 9, 10}`, `unique_b` is `{11, 12, 13, 14}`, `relevant_a` is `set()`, `relevant_b` is `set()`, `only_a` is `set()`, `both` is `set()`, `only_b` is `set()`, `total_distinct` is 0, `results` is `['YES', 'NO']`.**
