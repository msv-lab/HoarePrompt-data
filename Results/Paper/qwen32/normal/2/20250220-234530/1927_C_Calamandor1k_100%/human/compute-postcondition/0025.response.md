The code snippet updates the value of `unique_b` by setting it to a new set created from the list `b`. Given the initial state, `b` is `[4, 5, 6, 7]`, so `unique_b` remains unchanged as `{4, 5, 6, 7}`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is 1, `cases` is `[(3, 4, 2, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7])]`, `unique_a` is `{1, 2, 3}`, `unique_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_a` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `only_a` is `set()`, `both` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `total_distinct` is `len(only_b) + 4`, `results` is `['NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES']`**
