The code snippet creates a set `relevant_b` that includes elements from `unique_b` which are less than or equal to `k`. Given the initial state, `unique_b` is `{11, 12, 13, 14}` and `k` is `3`. Since none of the elements in `unique_b` are less than or equal to `3`, the resulting set `relevant_b` will be an empty set.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `cases` is `[(5, 6, 3, [8, 9, 10], [11, 12, 13, 14])]`, `n` is 5, `m` is 6, `k` is 3, `a` is `[8, 9, 10]`, `b` is `[11, 12, 13, 14]`, `unique_a` is `{8, 9, 10}`, `unique_b` is `{11, 12, 13, 14}`, `relevant_a` is `set()`, `relevant_b` is `set()`, `only_a` is `{1, 2}`, `both` is `set()`, `only_b` is `set()`, `total_distinct` is 2, `results` is `['YES']`**.
