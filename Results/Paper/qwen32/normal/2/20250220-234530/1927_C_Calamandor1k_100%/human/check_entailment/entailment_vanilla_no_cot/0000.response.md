To determine if the provided program correctly solves the given problem, let's analyze the logic step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis
We need to determine if we can select exactly `k/2` elements from array `a` and `k/2` elements from array `b` such that all integers from `1` to `k` are included among the chosen elements.

### Key Points
1. **Unique Elements**: We need to consider unique elements in both arrays because selecting duplicate elements doesn't help in covering more distinct integers.
2. **Relevant Elements**: Only elements in the range `[1, k]` are relevant since we need to cover integers from `1` to `k`.
3. **Set Operations**:
   - `only_a`: Elements that are in `a` but not in `b`.
   - `only_b`: Elements that are in `b` but not in `a`.
   - `both`: Elements that are in both `a` and `b`.
4. **Conditions**:
   - If the number of elements in `only_a` exceeds `k/2`, it's impossible to pick `k/2` elements from `b` to cover all integers from `1` to `k`, so the answer is "NO".
   - Similarly, if the number of elements in `only_b` exceeds `k/2`, the answer is "NO".
   - The total number of distinct elements (`len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)`) must be at least `k` to ensure all integers from `1` to `k` can be covered.

### Code Analysis
Let's examine the provided code against these points:

```python
def func_1(t, cases):
    results = []
    for (n, m, k, a, b) in cases:
        unique_a = set(a)
        unique_b = set(b)
        relevant_a = {x for x in unique_a if x <= k}
        relevant_b = {x for x in unique_b if x <= k}
        only_a = relevant_a - relevant_b
        only_b = relevant_b - relevant_a
        both = relevant_a & relevant_b
        if len(only_a) > k // 2:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        if len(only_b) > k // 2:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        total_distinct = len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)
        if total_distinct < k:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        results.append('YES')
    return results
```

- **Unique Elements**: The code correctly creates sets `unique_a` and `unique_b` to get unique elements from `a` and `b`.
- **Relevant Elements**: It filters these sets to include only elements that are less than or equal to `k`.
- **Set Operations**: It calculates `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` using set operations.
- **Conditions**: The conditions to check if `only_a` and `only_b` exceed `k/2` and if the total number of distinct elements is less than `k` are correctly implemented.

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
