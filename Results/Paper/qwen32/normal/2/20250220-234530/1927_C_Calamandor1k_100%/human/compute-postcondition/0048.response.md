The code assigns the value of `relevant_b - relevant_a` to `only_b`. Given the initial state, `relevant_a` is an empty set (`set()`), and `relevant_b` is also an empty set (`set()`). Therefore, the difference between these two sets is still an empty set.

Thus, `only_b` remains an empty set. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `cases` is `[(5, 6, 3, [8, 9, 10], [11, 12, 13, 14])]`, `n` is 5, `m` is 6, `k` is 3, `a` is `[8, 9, 10]`, `b` is `[11, 12, 13, 14]`, `unique_a` is `{8, 9, 10}`, `unique_b` is `{11, 12, 13, 14}`, `relevant_a` is `set()`, `relevant_b` is `set()`, `only_a` is `set()`, `both` is `set()`, `only_b` is `set()`, `total_distinct` is 2, `results` is `['YES']`**
