The code calculates the intersection of `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` and assigns it to the variable `both`. Given that both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` are `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, their intersection will also be `{4, 5, 6, 7}`.

Thus, the value of `both` will be `{4, 5, 6, 7}`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `cases` is `[(3, 4, 2, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7])]`, `results` is `[]`, `unique_a` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `unique_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_a` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `only_a` is `{x for x in relevant_a if x not in relevant_b}`, `only_b` is `set()`, `both` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`**
