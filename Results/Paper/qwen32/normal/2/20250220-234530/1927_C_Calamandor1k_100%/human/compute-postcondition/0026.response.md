To determine the new state after executing the given Python code, let's analyze the impact of the line:

```python
relevant_a = {x for x in unique_a if x <= k}
```

Given the initial state:
- `t` is 1
- `cases` is `[(3, 4, 2, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7])]`
- `unique_a` is `{1, 2, 3}`
- `unique_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`
- `relevant_a` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`
- `relevant_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`
- `only_a` is `set()`
- `both` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`
- `total_distinct` is `len(only_b) + 4`
- `results` is `['NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES']`

The variable `k` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value directly. However, the set comprehension `{x for x in unique_a if x <= k}` will filter elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`. Since `unique_a` is `{1, 2, 3}`, the resulting set `relevant_a` will depend on the value of `k`.

Let's consider different possible values of `k`:
- If `k < 1`, `relevant_a` will be an empty set `set()`.
- If `1 <= k < 2`, `relevant_a` will be `{1}`.
- If `2 <= k < 3`, `relevant_a` will be `{1, 2}`.
- If `k >= 3`, `relevant_a` will be `{1, 2, 3}`.

Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we can only express the final state in terms of `k`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `cases` is `[(3, 4, 2, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7])]`, `unique_a` is `{1, 2, 3}`, `unique_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_a` is `{x for x in unique_a if x <= k}`, `relevant_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `only_a` is `set()`, `both` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `total_distinct` is `len(only_b) + 4`, `results` is `['NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES']`**

In natural language: The value of `relevant_a` is now a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
