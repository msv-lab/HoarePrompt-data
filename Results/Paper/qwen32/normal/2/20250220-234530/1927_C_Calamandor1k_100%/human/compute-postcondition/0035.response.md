The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables or the flow outside of the loop. Since there is no loop structure provided in the given context, the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the overall state.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `cases` is `[(3, 4, 2, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7])]`, `unique_a` is `{1, 2, 3}`, `unique_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_a` is `{x for x in unique_a if x <= k}`, `relevant_b` is `{x for x in {4, 5, 6, 7} if x <= k}`, `only_a` is `relevant_a - relevant_b`, `both` is `set()`, `only_b` is `{x for x in {4, 5, 6, 7} if x <= k} - {x for x in unique_a if x <= k}`, `total_distinct` is `len(only_b) + 4`, `results` is `['NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES', 'NO', 'NO']` if `results` was `['NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES', 'NO']` initially, or `results` is `['NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES', 'NO']` if `results` was `['NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES']` initially.**
