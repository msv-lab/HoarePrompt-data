The code appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `cases` is `[(3, 4, 2, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7])]`, `results` is `['NO', 'NO']`, `unique_a` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `unique_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_a` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `only_a` is `set()` if the length of `only_a` is greater than `k // 2`; otherwise, `only_a` is `{x for x in relevant_a if x not in relevant_b}`, `only_b` is a set with more than `k // 2` elements, `both` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`. The current value of `only_b` has a length greater than `k // 2`.**

In natural language: The `results` list now contains two elements, both of which are `'NO'`. All other variables retain their initial values.
