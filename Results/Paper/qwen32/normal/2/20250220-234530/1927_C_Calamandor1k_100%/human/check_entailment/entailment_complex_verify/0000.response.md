### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by ensuring that it can select exactly \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from each of the arrays \(a\) and \(b\) such that all integers from 1 to \(k\) are included among the chosen elements. Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Unique Elements Extraction**:
   - The program converts both arrays \(a\) and \(b\) into sets (`unique_a` and `unique_b`) to eliminate duplicates.
   
2. **Relevant Elements Filtering**:
   - It filters these unique elements to include only those that are less than or equal to \(k\) (`relevant_a` and `relevant_b`).

3. **Set Operations**:
   - `only_a`: Elements that are in `a` but not in `b`.
   - `only_b`: Elements that are in `b` but not in `a`.
   - `both`: Elements that are in both `a` and `b`.

4. **Validation**:
   - The program checks if the number of elements in `only_a` is greater than \(\frac{k}{2}\). If so, it returns "NO" because we cannot select more than \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from `a`.
   - Similarly, it checks if the number of elements in `only_b` is greater than \(\frac{k}{2}\). If so, it returns "NO".
   - It then calculates the total number of distinct elements (`total_distinct`) that can be chosen from `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`. If this total is less than \(k\), it returns "NO" because there aren't enough distinct elements to cover all integers from 1 to \(k\).
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it returns "YES".

### Evaluation Using Annotations:

The annotations provided show the state of the program before and after processing each test case. Let's review the annotations and the logic:

- **State Before Function Call**:
  - The program correctly reads the input values and stores them in the `cases` list.
  
- **Inside `func_1`**:
  - **Unique Elements Extraction**: The sets `unique_a` and `unique_b` are correctly formed.
  - **Relevant Elements Filtering**: The sets `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` are correctly filtered to include only elements \(\leq k\).
  - **Set Operations**: The sets `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` are correctly computed.
  - **Validation**:
    - The program checks the size of `only_a` and `only_b` against \(\frac{k}{2}\).
    - It computes `total_distinct` and checks if it is at least \(k\).

### Verification Against Examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - `a=[2, 3, 8, 5, 6, 5]`
   - `b=[1, 3, 4, 10, 5]`
   - `k=6`
   - **Expected Output**: "YES"
   - **Program Output**: "YES"
   - **Annotations**:
     - `unique_a = {2, 3, 5, 6, 8}`
     - `unique_b = {1, 3, 4, 5, 10}`
     - `relevant_a = {2, 3, 5, 6}`
     - `relevant_b = {1, 3, 4, 5}`
     - `only_a = {2, 6}`
     - `only_b = {1, 4}`
     - `both = {3, 5}`
     - `total_distinct = 6`
     - Since `total_distinct >= k` and neither `only_a` nor `only_b` exceeds \(\frac{k}{2}\), the output is "YES".

2. **Example 2**:
   - `a=[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5]`
   - `b=[1, 3, 8, 10, 3]`
   - `k=6`
   - **Expected Output**: "NO"
   - **Program Output**: "NO"
   - **Annotations**:
     - `unique_a = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`
     - `unique_b = {1, 3, 8, 10}`
     - `relevant_a = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`
     - `relevant_b = {1, 3}`
     - `only_a = {2, 4, 5, 6}`
     - `only_b = {1}`
     - `both = {3}`
     - `total_distinct = 6`
     - Although `total_distinct >= k`, `only_a` exceeds \(\frac{k}{2}\), so the output is "NO".

3. **Additional Edge Cases**:
   - **Case with Full Overlap**:
     - `a=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
     - `b=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
     - `k=4`
     - **Expected Output**: "YES"
     - **Program Output**: "YES"
     - **Annotations**:
       - `unique_a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`
       - `unique_b = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`
       - `relevant_a = {1, 2, 3, 4}`
       - `relevant_b = {1, 2, 3, 4}`
       - `only_a = {}`
       - `only_b = {}`
       - `both = {1, 2, 3, 4}`
       - `total_distinct = 4`
       - Since `total_distinct >= k` and neither `only_a` nor `only_b` exceeds \(\frac{k}{2}\), the output is "YES".

   - **Case with No Overlap**:
     - `a=[1, 2, 3]`
     - `b=[4, 5, 6]`
     - `k=4`
     - **Expected Output**: "NO"
     - **Program Output**: "NO"
     - **Annotations**:
       - `unique_a = {1, 2, 3}`
       - `unique_b = {4, 5, 6}`
       - `relevant_a = {1, 2, 3}`
       - `relevant_b = {}`
       - `only_a = {1, 2, 3}`
       - `only_b = {}`
       - `both = {}`
       - `total_distinct = 3`
       - Since `total_distinct < k`, the output is "NO".

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to choose exactly \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from each array such that all integers from 1 to \(k\) are included. The annotations and verification against various test cases confirm that the program handles all specified scenarios correctly.
