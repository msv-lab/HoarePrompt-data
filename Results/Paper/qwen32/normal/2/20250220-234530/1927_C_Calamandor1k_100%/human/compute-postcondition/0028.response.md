Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the new state:

- `t` is 1
- `cases` is `[(3, 4, 2, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7])]`
- `unique_a` is `{1, 2, 3}`
- `unique_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`
- `relevant_a` is `{x for x in unique_a if x <= k}` (Note: `k` is not defined in the initial state, but we'll assume it's a value that affects the sets)
- `relevant_b` is `{x for x in {4, 5, 6, 7} if x <= k}` (Similarly, `k` affects this set)
- `only_a` is `set()`
- `both` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`
- `total_distinct` is `len(only_b) + 4` (Note: `only_b` is not defined in the initial state, but we'll assume it's a set affecting this calculation)
- `results` is `['NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES']`

The code snippet modifies `only_a`:
```
only_a = relevant_a - relevant_b
```

Since `k` is not specified, we can't determine the exact elements of `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`. However, we know that `relevant_a` contains elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, and `relevant_b` contains elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`.

Assuming `k` is such that `relevant_a` could potentially contain elements from `unique_a` and `relevant_b` could potentially contain elements from `unique_b`, the difference `relevant_a - relevant_b` would be the elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`.

Given the initial sets:
- `unique_a` is `{1, 2, 3}`
- `unique_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`

If `k` is large enough to include all elements in both sets, then:
- `relevant_a` would be `{1, 2, 3}`
- `relevant_b` would be `{4, 5, 6, 7}`

Thus, `only_a` would be:
- `only_a = {1, 2, 3} - {4, 5, 6, 7} = {1, 2, 3}`

However, since `k` is not specified, we can only say that `only_a` will be the set difference between `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `cases` is `[(3, 4, 2, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7])]`, `unique_a` is `{1, 2, 3}`, `unique_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_a` is `{x for x in unique_a if x <= k}`, `relevant_b` is `{x for x in {4, 5, 6, 7} if x <= k}`, `only_a` is `relevant_a - relevant_b`, `both` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `total_distinct` is `len(only_b) + 4`, `results` is `['NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES']`**
