Output State: **`t` is 1, `cases` is `[(3, 4, 2, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7])]`, `results` is `['NO', 'NO']`, `unique_a` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `unique_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_a` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `only_a` is `set()`, `only_b` is a set with more than `k // 2` elements, `both` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`. The current value of `only_b` has a length greater than `k // 2`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not affect the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration. Since there are no changes to the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
