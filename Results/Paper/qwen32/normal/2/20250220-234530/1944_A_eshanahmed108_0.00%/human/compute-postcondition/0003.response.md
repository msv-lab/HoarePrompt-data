In the given task, the loop is defined as:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable, meaning it is not used within the loop body. The number of iterations is determined by the value read from the input, which is converted to an integer.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input

Since the loop variable `_` does not affect the state and is not used in the loop body, we only need to consider the input value that determines the number of iterations.

Let's denote the input value (which determines the number of iterations) as `iterations`. After each iteration, the number of remaining iterations decreases by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, the number of remaining iterations should be one less than the number of iterations at the end of the previous iteration.

However, since `t`, `n`, and `k` are not directly related to the loop control variable, they remain unchanged. The only thing that changes is the implicit state of how many times the loop will run, which is controlled by the input value.

Thus, if we assume that at the end of the previous iteration, there were `iterations` left, then at the start of the next iteration, there would be `iterations - 1` left.

Since the problem does not specify the exact number of iterations left (`iterations`), we can only express the state in terms of the decrement of this implicit state.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; the number of remaining iterations is one less than at the end of the previous iteration.**

If we hypothetically denote the number of remaining iterations as a variable `remaining_iterations`, then the state would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `remaining_iterations` is decreased by 1.**

But since `remaining_iterations` is not explicitly part of the given state, we can simply state:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.** (implying the number of iterations is one less than before)

So the final answer is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.**
