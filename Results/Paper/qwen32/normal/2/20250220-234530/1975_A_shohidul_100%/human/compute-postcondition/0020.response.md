Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `check_all` is False. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end of `a`. If `check_all_new` is True and `new_all` is True, all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]` and in non-decreasing order, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, either `check_all_new` is False, `new_all` is False, or both, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, no changes are made to `new`, `check_all_new`, or `new_all`.**
