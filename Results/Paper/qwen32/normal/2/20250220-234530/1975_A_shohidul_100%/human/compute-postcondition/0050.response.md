The code snippet creates a new list `new` which contains all elements from the list `a` starting from index `i` to the end of the list. The preconditions about `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, and the specific condition at index `i` remain unchanged except for the introduction of the new list `new`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order; at index `i`, the element `a[i-1]` is greater than the element `a[i]; `new` is a list containing elements from `a[i:]`.**
