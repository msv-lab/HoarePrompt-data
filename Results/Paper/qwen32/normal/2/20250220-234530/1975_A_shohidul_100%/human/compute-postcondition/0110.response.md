Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end of `a`, `check_all_new` is a boolean indicating whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`, `new_all` is `True` if every element in `new` is less than or equal to the next element, otherwise `new_all` is `False`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of regardless of whether `check_all_new` and `new_all` are true or false. If `a[i - 1] <= a[i]`, no additional changes are made to `new`, `check_all_new`, or `new_all`.**
