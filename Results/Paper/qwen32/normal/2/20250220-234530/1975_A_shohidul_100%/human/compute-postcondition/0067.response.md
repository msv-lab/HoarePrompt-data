The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. This output does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. The initial state provides context about the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `i`, `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all`, but these do not influence the content of the `print` statement.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `check_all` indicates if `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i`.
- `check_all_new` checks if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`.
- `new_all` checks if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Despite these variables and their conditions, the `print` statement simply outputs `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **NO**
