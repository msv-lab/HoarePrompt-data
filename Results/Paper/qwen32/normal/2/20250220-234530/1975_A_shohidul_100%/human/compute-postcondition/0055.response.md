Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order; at index `i`, the element `a[i-1]` is greater than the element `a[i]; `new` is a list containing elements from `a[i:]`; `check_all_new` is True; `new_all` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables remain unchanged, and we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
