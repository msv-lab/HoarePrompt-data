To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's analyze the given conditions and the behavior of the loop.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
- For each iteration, it checks if `a[i-1] > a[i]`.
- If `a[i-1] > a[i]`, it creates a sublist `new` from `a[i:]` and checks two conditions:
  - `check_all_new`: Whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`.
  - `new_all`: Whether `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- If both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are True, it prints 'YES' and breaks the loop.
- If either condition fails, it prints 'NO' and breaks the loop.
- If `a[i-1] <= a[i]`, it does nothing and moves to the next iteration.

### Given Output States:
- After 1st iteration (`i = 1`): If `a[0] > a[1]`, it checks `new = a[1:]` and the conditions.
- After 2nd iteration (`i = 2`): If `a[1] > a[2]`, it checks `new = a[2:]` and the conditions.
- After 3rd iteration (`i = 3`): If `a[2] > a[3]`, it checks `new = a[3:]` and the conditions.

### Final Iteration:
- The loop will continue until `i = n-1`.
- If none of the conditions `a[i-1] > a[i]` lead to both `check_all_new` and `new_all` being True within the loop, the loop will complete all iterations without breaking.
- If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, it means that no such pair `(a[i-1], a[i])` was found where `a[i-1] > a[i]` and `new` satisfies both conditions.

### Conclusion:
- If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, it implies that the list `a` does not satisfy the specific conditions checked in the loop, and no 'YES' or 'NO' is printed during the loop.
- The variable `check_all` remains `False` as per the precondition and is not modified within the loop.

### Final Output State:
- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `n` remains the same.
- `a` remains the same list of integers.
- `check_all` remains `False`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `check_all` is False.**
