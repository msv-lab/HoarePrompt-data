Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is `False`, `i` is an index where `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end. If both `check_all_new` (where `a[0] >= new[j]` for all `j` in the range of `len(new)`) and `new_all` (where `new` is non-decreasing) are `True`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, either `check_all_new` or `new_all` is `False`, and the most internal loop or if statement is also broken.**
