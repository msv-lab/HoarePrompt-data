The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. This means the value of `a` changes based on the new input.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` must still be greater than 0 (precondition remains unchanged).
- `n` is the new input integer (precondition remains unchanged).
- `a` is now a list of integers obtained from the new input.
- `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order (unchanged, but its value may now be different based on the new list `a`).
- If `check_all` is False, `i` is set to the new value of `n` (unchanged, but the condition might now apply differently).

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order; if `check_all` is False, `i` is set to the new value of `n`.**
