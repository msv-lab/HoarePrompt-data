To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.
- The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value (let's call it `i_prev`). Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the iteration, `i_prev + 1` is the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i_prev + 1` must be less than `n`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` at the start of the next iteration will be `i_prev + 1`. Since `i_prev` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i` was incremented by 1, the new value of `i` is simply `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this increment.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**

Since only `i` in the loop head needs adjustment:
State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `i` is `i + 1`.**

However, to be more precise and clear:
If `i` was `i_prev` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

So, if we denote the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration as `i_next`, then `i_next = i_prev + 1`.

Thus, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `i` is `i + 1`.**

Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration is `i + 1`.

So the final state is:
State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `i` is `i + 1`.**

But to be more explicit about the transition:
State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `i` is `i + 1`.**

Final Answer:
State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `i` is `i + 1`.**
