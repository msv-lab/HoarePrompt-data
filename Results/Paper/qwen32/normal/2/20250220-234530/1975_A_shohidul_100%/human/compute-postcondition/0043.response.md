The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common placeholder for a loop variable when its value is not used within the loop body) and `t`. Since `_` does not affect the loop's continuation condition, we only need to adjust `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` should be decremented by 1, ensuring that it remains greater than 0.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If `check_all` is True, it confirms that the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If `check_all` is False, it indicates that the list `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order.**
