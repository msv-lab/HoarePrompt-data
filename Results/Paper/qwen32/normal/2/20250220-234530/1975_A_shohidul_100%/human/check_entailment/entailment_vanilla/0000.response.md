Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We have multiple test cases.
- For each test case, we are given an array `a` of length `n`.
- We need to determine if we can sort this array in non-decreasing order by performing zero or more operations where we split the array into a prefix and a suffix and swap them.
- We need to output "Yes" if it's possible to sort the array in this manner, otherwise "No".

### Analysis of the Provided Code:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Checking if Already Sorted:**
   - The code checks if the array is already sorted using the condition `all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`. If true, it prints "YES" because no operations are needed.

3. **Handling Non-Sorted Arrays:**
   - If the array is not sorted, the code enters a loop that iterates over the array starting from the second element.
   - It looks for the first position `i` where `a[i-1] > a[i]`, indicating a potential split point.
   - When such a point is found, it creates a new subarray `new` starting from index `i` to the end of the array.
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - `check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])`: This checks if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to every element in the new subarray.
     - `new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])`: This checks if the new subarray is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints "YES" and breaks out of the loop.
   - If either condition fails, it prints "NO" and breaks out of the loop.

### Issues with the Provided Code:
- The logic for determining if the array can be sorted by swapping a prefix and suffix is flawed.
- Specifically, the condition `a[0] >= new[i]` is too restrictive. It only checks if the first element of the array is greater than or equal to every element in the new subarray, but it doesn't account for the possibility of finding a valid split point where the prefix and suffix can be swapped to form a sorted array.
- The code should instead find a point where the array can be split into two parts such that the maximum of the first part is less than or equal to the minimum of the second part, and both parts are individually sorted.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the required logic to determine if the array can be sorted by the specified operation. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
