The code snippet `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the element `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given the initial state, `ans2` already has `c[i]` appended to it, so executing this line will append `c[i]` again.

Therefore, the new state of `ans2` will be that it contains `c[i]` twice in a row. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged, and the condition regarding `k` (whether the loop or if statement is broken) is also unaffected.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `ans2` has had `c[i]` appended to it twice; if `k` is equal to 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no additional changes occur.**
