The code snippet `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `b` to the list `ans1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, and `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order.

Since `i` is 3, the element at index 3 of `b` (which is the fourth smallest element in the sorted list `b`) is appended to `ans1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is the newly read list of integers from the input, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a` sorted in ascending order, `req` is twice the second integer read from the input, `i` is 3, `ans2` is `[]`, `ans1` contains the fourth smallest element of `b`. If `k == 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
