Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is the newly read list of integers from the input, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a` sorted in ascending order, `ans1` contains pairs of consecutive equal elements from `b` up to the point where `k` becomes 0, `req` is twice the second integer read from the input, `i` is the last index processed before the loop breaks, `ans2` is `[]`, `k` is twice the second integer read from the input, and `l` contains elements from `b` that are not part of any pair of consecutive equal elements and are not equal to their next element.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
        ans2.append(c[i])
        ans2.append(c[i])
        k -= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is the newly read list of integers from the input, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a` sorted in ascending order, `ans1` contains pairs of consecutive equal elements from `b` up to the point where `k` becomes 0, `req` is twice the second integer read from the input, `i` is the last index processed before the loop breaks, `ans2` is either `[]` or contains `[c[i], c[i]]` if `c[i]` equals `c[i - 1]`, and `l` contains elements from `b` that are not part of any pair of consecutive equal elements and are not equal to their next element. If `c[i]` equals `c[i - 1]`, then `k` is decreased by 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `i + 1`. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` has had `c[i]` appended to it twice and `k` is `k - 2`. If `k` becomes 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no additional changes occur.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `i + 2`, `n` remains the same. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, `ans2` has an additional element which is `c[i]` and `k` is decreased by 2. Otherwise, `ans2` and `k` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
