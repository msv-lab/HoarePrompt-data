Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is the newly read list of integers from the input, `b` is the first `n` elements of the new `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a`, sorted in ascending order, `ans1` is an empty list if `b[n-2] != b[n-1]`, otherwise `ans1` contains the largest element of `b` twice, `req` is twice the second integer read from the input, `i` is the last index processed before the loop breaks, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is twice the second integer read from the input if `b[n-2] != b[n-1]`, otherwise `k` is twice the second integer read from the input minus 2, and `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`. Additionally, `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`.**
