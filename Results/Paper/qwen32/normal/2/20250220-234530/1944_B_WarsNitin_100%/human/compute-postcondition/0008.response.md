The given Python code snippet initializes an empty list named `ans1`. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `q`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, or `c`.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same except for the new variable `ans1` which is now an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is the list of integers read from the input, `b` is the sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is the sorted list of integers from `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a`, `ans1` is an empty list.**
