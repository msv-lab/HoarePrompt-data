### Reasoning:

The key insight to solve this problem lies in the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins ('U') in the initial configuration. Here's why:

- If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always ensure she leaves an even number of facing-up coins for Bob after her turn. This forces Bob into a position where he will eventually face a situation with an odd number of facing-up coins, which he cannot avoid leaving an even number for Alice again. This cycle continues until Alice wins because she will always be able to make a move when there is at least one facing-up coin, and Bob will eventually be left with no moves (i.e., no facing-up coins).

- Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can mirror Alice's strategy and always leave an even number of facing-up coins for Alice. Eventually, Alice will be forced into a position where she has no moves left, and Bob wins.

The provided code correctly implements this logic by counting the number of 'U' characters in the string `s` and checking if this count is odd or even. If the count is odd, it returns 'YES', indicating Alice's victory; otherwise, it returns 'NO', indicating Bob's victory.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the provided program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
