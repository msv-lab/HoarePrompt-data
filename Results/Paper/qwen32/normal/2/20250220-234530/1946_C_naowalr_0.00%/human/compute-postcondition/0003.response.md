The given code snippet initializes the adjacency list `adj` to be a list of empty lists, with the length of the list being `n + 1`. This means that each vertex in the tree (from 1 to `n`) will have its own empty list to store adjacent vertices. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k < n`, `t` must be greater than 0.**
