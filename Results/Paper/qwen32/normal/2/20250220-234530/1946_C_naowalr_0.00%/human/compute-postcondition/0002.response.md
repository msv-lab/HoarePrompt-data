The code reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, `n` is the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k < n`, and `t` must be greater than 0. After executing the code, the values of `n` and `k` will be updated to the integers read from the input.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k < n`, `t` must be greater than 0.**
