Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains the integers representing the connections read from the input, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is modified by `dfs`, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs`. Additionally, `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k`, and if `numCuts` equals `k`, then `leftover` is less than `x`.**
