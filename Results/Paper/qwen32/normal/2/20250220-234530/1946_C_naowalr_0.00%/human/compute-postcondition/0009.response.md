The code snippet reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The values of `a` and `b` are now updated based on the input, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` includes `b` and `adj[b]` includes `a`; `n` must be at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from the input such that `1 <= k < n`; `t` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input.**

In natural language: The values of `a` and `b` have been updated to the integers read from the input. All other variables (`adj`, `n`, `k`, `t`, and `i`) retain their initial values.
