Given the initial conditions and the code snippet, let's determine the new state:

- If `numCuts > k` or `(numCuts == k and leftover >= x)`, `L` is set to 50001 and `R` remains 100001.
- Otherwise, `L` remains 1 and `R` is set to 50001.
- In both cases, `z` is incremented by 1.
- `x` is initially 50001 and is reassigned to `(L + R) // 2`.
- `leftover` holds the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.

Let's compute the new value of `x`:

1. If `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001:
   \[
   x = \frac{50001 + 100001}{2} = \frac{150002}{2} = 75001
   \]

2. If `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001:
   \[
   x = \frac{1 + 50001}{2} = \frac{50002}{2} = 25001
   \]

Therefore, the new value of `x` depends on the initial values of `L` and `R`.

Output State: **`L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001, or `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001; `z` is incremented by 1; `x` is 75001 or 25001; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `k` is the second integer read from input; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist contains the indices of the nodes directly connected to the corresponding node; `i` is equal to `n - 1`; `numCuts` is either greater than `k` or equal to `k` with `leftover` being greater than or equal to `x` in the first case, and less than or equal to `k` or equal to `k` with `leftover` being less than `x` in the second case; `leftover` holds the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**.
