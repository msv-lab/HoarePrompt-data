To determine what will be printed when the `print(L)` statement is executed, let's break down the given initial state:

- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists, where each sublist contains integers representing connections (presumably edges in a graph).
- `L` is the final lower bound determined by a loop.
- `R` is set to `L + 1`.
- `numCuts` is the final number of cuts determined by the last iteration of the loop.
- `leftover` is the final leftover value determined by the last iteration of the loop.

Given this information, we know that `L` is a value that is determined by some loop in the code, but the exact value of `L` is not explicitly stated in the initial conditions. Therefore, we can only describe `L` in terms of how it is defined within the context of the loop.

Since the exact value of `L` is not provided, we can only say that `L` is the final lower bound computed by the loop. Thus, the output will be described in terms of this definition.

Output: **L (where L is the final lower bound determined by the loop)**
