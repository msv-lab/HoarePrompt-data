Postcondition: **`L` and `R` are set based on the condition `numCuts > k` or `(numCuts == k and leftover >= x)`. If true, `L` is 50001 and `R` remains 100001. If false, `L` remains 1 and `R` is set to 50001. `z` is incremented by 1 in both cases. `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist contains the indices of the nodes directly connected to the corresponding node, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `numCuts` is either greater than `k` or equal to `k` with `leftover` being greater than or equal to `x` in the first case, and less than or equal to `k` or equal to `k` with `leftover` being less than `x` in the second case. `x` is 50001, and `leftover` holds the result of `dfs(1, 1)` in both cases.**
