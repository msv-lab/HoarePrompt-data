The provided code snippet reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This means the values of `a` and `b` will be updated based on the new input, overwriting their previous values.

Since the initial state specifies that `a` and `b` are integers read from the standard input, and the code snippet also reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to `a` and `b`, the new values of `a` and `b` will be whatever integers are provided in the next input line.

The other variables (`n`, `i`, `adj[a]`, `adj[b]`) remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are the new integers read from the standard input, `adj[a]` includes `b` twice, `adj[b]` includes `a` three times.**
