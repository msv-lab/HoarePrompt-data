The code snippet provided sets the variable `L` to the value of `x`. Given that `x` is specified as 50001, `L` will now hold this value.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in an undirected graph; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from the input such that `1 <= k < n`; `t` is greater than 0; `i` ranges from 0 to `n-2` during the loop's execution; `a` and `b` are pairs of integers read from the input representing edges in the graph; `L` is 50001; `R` is 100001; `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`; `x` is 50001; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`**
