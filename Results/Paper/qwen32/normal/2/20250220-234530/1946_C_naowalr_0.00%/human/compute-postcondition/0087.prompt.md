Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `z` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist contains the indices of the nodes directly connected to the corresponding node, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `numCuts` is 0
Code of the loop:
while R - L > 1:
    x = (L + R) // 2
    numCuts = 0
    leftover = dfs(1, 1)
    if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
        L = x
    else:
        R = x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `L` and `R` are set based on the condition `numCuts > k` or `(numCuts == k and leftover >= x)`. If true, `L` is 50001 and `R` remains 100001. If false, `L` remains 1 and `R` is set to 50001. `z` is incremented by 1 in both cases. `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist contains the indices of the nodes directly connected to the corresponding node, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `numCuts` is either greater than `k` or equal to `k` with `leftover` being greater than or equal to `x` in the first case, and less than or equal to `k` or equal to `k` with `leftover` being less than `x` in the second case. `x` is 50001, and `leftover` holds the result of `dfs(1, 1)` in both cases.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `L` is either 50001 or 75001, and `R` is either 100001 or 75001, or `L` is 1 or 25001, and `R` is 50001 or 25001; `z` is incremented by 1; `x` is 75001 or 25001; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `k` is the second integer read from input; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist contains the indices of the nodes directly connected to the corresponding node; `i` is equal to `n - 1`; `numCuts` is 0; `leftover` holds the result of `dfs(1, 1)`. Specifically, if `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `L` is 75001 or 25001 and `R` is 100001 or 50001. Otherwise, `L` is 50001 or 1 and `R` is 75001 or 25001.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `L` is either 50001 or 75001, and `R` is either 75001, 62501, 87501, 25001, 12501, or 37501 if `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`). Otherwise, `L` is 75001, 62501, 87501, 25001, 12501, or 37501, and `R` is either 100001 or 75001, or `L` is 1 or 25001, and `R` is 50001 or 25001. `z` is incremented by 1. `x` is 75001, 62501, 87501, 25001, 12501, or 37501. `n` is an integer greater than 1. `k` is the second integer read from input. `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist contains the indices of the nodes directly connected to the corresponding node. `i` is equal to `n - 1`. `numCuts` is 0. `leftover` holds the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
