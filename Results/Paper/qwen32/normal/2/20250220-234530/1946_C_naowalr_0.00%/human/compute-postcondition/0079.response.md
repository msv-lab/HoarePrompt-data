Postcondition: **`L` is either 50001 or 75001, and `R` is either 100001 or 75001, or `L` is 1 or 25001, and `R` is 50001 or 25001; `z` is incremented by 1; `x` is 75001 or 25001; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `k` is the second integer read from input; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist contains the indices of the nodes directly connected to the corresponding node; `i` is equal to `n - 1`; `numCuts` is 0; `leftover` holds the result of `dfs(1, 1)`. Specifically, if `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `L` is 75001 or 25001 and `R` is 100001 or 50001. Otherwise, `L` is 50001 or 1 and `R` is 75001 or 25001.**
