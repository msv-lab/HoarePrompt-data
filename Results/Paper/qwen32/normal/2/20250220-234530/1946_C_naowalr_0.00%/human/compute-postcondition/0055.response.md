The code snippet `adj[b].append(a)` modifies the list at index `b` in the list `adj` by appending the value `a` to it. This affects the list `adj` but does not change any other variables.

Given the initial state, the only change is that the list at index `b` in `adj` now includes the additional element `a`.

Output State: **`L` is the largest integer such that the condition `numCuts > k` or `numCuts == k` and `leftover >= L` is not satisfied, `R` is `L + 1`, `z` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the sublist at index `b` includes `a` in addition to its previous elements, `a` and `b` are the two integers just read from input, `i` is incremented by 1.**
