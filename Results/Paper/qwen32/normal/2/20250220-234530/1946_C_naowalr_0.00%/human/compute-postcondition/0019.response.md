The given code snippet only initializes the variable `numCuts` to 0. None of the other variables (`adj`, `n`, `k`, `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `L`, `R`) are modified by this line of code.

Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the new variable `numCuts`.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in an undirected graph; `n` must be at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from the input such that `1 <= k < n`; `t` must be greater than 0; `i` ranges from 0 to `n-2` during the loop's execution; `a` and `b` are pairs of integers read from the input representing edges in the graph; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001; `numCuts` is 0.**
