The code snippet `adj[b].append(a)` appends the value `a` to the list `adj[b]`. This means that the list `adj[b]` will now include `a` as an additional element, potentially as a duplicate if `a` was already present in `adj[b]`.

Given the initial state, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` includes `b` and `adj[b]` includes `a`. After executing the code, `adj[b]` will have `a` added to it.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` includes `b` and `adj[b]` includes `a` with `a` potentially duplicated in `adj[b]`; `n` must be at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from the input such that `1 <= k < n`; `t` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input.**
