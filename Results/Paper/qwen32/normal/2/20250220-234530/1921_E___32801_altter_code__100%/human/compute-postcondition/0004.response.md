Output State: **The program returns nothing (None)**.

Explanation: The provided code snippet simply contains a `return` statement without any value specified, which means it returns `None`. None of the variables (`t`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`) are used in the return statement, so they do not affect the output.
