You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/d2faa6ca73d70e765c2cc6ef0834e24c2e4a5528.png)
Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the board dimensions `h`, `w` and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)` respectively.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program checks if `x_b <= x_a`. If true, it prints "draw". This is incorrect because it doesn't consider the possibility of Alice winning if she can reach Bob's position before Bob reaches hers.
   - The program then checks if `(x_b - x_a) % 2 != 0`. If true, it proceeds to check if `y_a == y_b` and prints "Alice" if true. This logic is also incorrect because it doesn't account for the optimal moves and the possibility of Bob blocking Alice.

3. **Subsequent Moves:**
   - The program modifies the positions of Alice and Bob based on certain conditions, but these modifications are not aligned with the rules of the game and don't reflect optimal play.
   - The program uses variables like `a`, `b`, `t`, `c` to calculate potential moves, but these calculations are not correctly implemented according to the problem rules.

4. **Final Decision Making:**
   - The final decision-making logic is flawed. It checks conditions related to the positions of Alice and Bob after some arbitrary moves, but these conditions do not accurately determine the winner based on the game rules.

### Key Issues:
- The program incorrectly assumes that if `x_b <= x_a`, the game is a draw, which is not necessarily true.
- The program does not correctly simulate the optimal moves for both players.
- The program's logic for determining the winner is flawed and does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly determine the outcome of the game based on the provided problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
