Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `r` is a list of six integers [h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b] for one of the test cases; Each of the next t-1 lines contains six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9. It is guaranteed that either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b. The sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6; `n` is the first element of `r`; `m` is the second element of `r`; `x1` is the third element of `r` plus 1; `y1` is the fourth element of `r` plus 1 if `y2` is greater than `y1`, otherwise `y1` is the fourth element of `r` minus 1; `x2` is the fifth element of `r`; `y2` is the sixth element of `r`. Additionally, `x2` is greater than `x1` and `(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`. `y1` is not equal to `y2`. If `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`, then `a` is `y2 - 1`. Otherwise, if `y1` is less than `y2`, then `a` is `m - y2`.**
