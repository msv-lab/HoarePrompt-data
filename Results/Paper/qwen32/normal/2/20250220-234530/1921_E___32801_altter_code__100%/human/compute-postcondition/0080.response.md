Postcondition: **`t` is `abs(y2 - 1)` if `y1 <= y2`, otherwise `t` is 0. `r` remains a list of six integers `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]`. `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is the third element of `r` plus `a`, `y1` is 1 if `y1 <= y2`, otherwise `y1` is `m`, `x2` is the fifth element of `r` minus `a`, `y2` remains the same if `y1 <= y2`, otherwise `y2` becomes `m`, `a` is 0, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `x2` is greater than `x1` and `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0`, `y1` is not equal to `y2` if `y1 <= y2`, otherwise `y1` is equal to `y2`, `x1` is at least 1, `x2` is less than or equal to `n`, and `c` is `t` if `y1 <= y2`, otherwise `c` is 0. Additionally, either `b // 2 <= a` or `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c` or `not (1 <= y1 <= m)` or `not (1 <= x1 <= n)` holds true.**
