You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/d2faa6ca73d70e765c2cc6ef0834e24c2e4a5528.png)
Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program seems to have several logical issues and does not correctly handle all edge cases as per the problem description. Here are a few specific issues identified:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Diagonal Moves**: The code attempts to simulate the moves but does not correctly account for diagonal moves and the optimal strategies of both players. For example, the code incorrectly modifies `y1` and `x1` after checking if `y1 == y2`, which doesn't align with the optimal strategy.

2. **Incorrect Draw Conditions**: The code incorrectly identifies draw conditions. For instance, it checks if `x2 <= x1` to determine a draw, which is not always accurate. A draw can occur only when neither player can make a valid move, which is not correctly handled.

3. **Incorrect Win Conditions**: The win conditions are not correctly implemented. For example, the code checks if `y1 == y2` after modifying `y1` and `x1`, which might not reflect the actual position of Alice's chip after her optimal move.

4. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The code does not handle edge cases such as when Alice or Bob is already in the last or first row respectively, or when the chips are positioned in such a way that no player can force a win.

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3 3 1 1 3 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Draw
```

**Actual Output:**
```
draw
```

While this specific example might seem to work, the logic within the code is flawed and does not correctly handle all scenarios. For instance, the code does not correctly simulate the optimal moves for both players and does not accurately determine the winner or a draw in all cases.

To ensure correctness, the program needs to be thoroughly reviewed and rewritten to correctly simulate the game according to the rules and determine the winner or a draw based on optimal play from both players.
