The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. This means the values of `c` and `r` will be updated based on the new input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `num`) remain unchanged unless they are explicitly modified in the code, which they are not in this case.

Given the initial state and the code, the output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `k` is greater than 0; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2; `i` is incremented by 1; `c` and `r` are updated to the new input values.**
