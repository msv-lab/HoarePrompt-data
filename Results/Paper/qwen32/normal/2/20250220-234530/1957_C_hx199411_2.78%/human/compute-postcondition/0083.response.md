To determine what will be printed by the `print(dp[m])` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the relationships between the variables:

1. **Initial State Breakdown**:
   - `t` is defined as `t - 1`, but since there's no initial value for `t`, it doesn't affect our analysis directly.
   - `n` is an integer such that `n - num >= 3`.
   - `k` is the second integer read from the input.
   - `num` is the cumulative sum of increments (1 or 2) over `k` iterations.
   - `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 5.
   - `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros with specific values set for indices 1 through 5:
     - `dp[1] = 1`
     - `dp[2] = 3`
     - `dp[3] = 7`
     - `dp[4] = 25`
     - `dp[5] = 81`
   - `i` is initialized to 6.

2. **Key Points**:
   - The value of `m` is crucial because it determines the index into the `dp` list that will be printed.
   - Since `m` must be at least 5, the smallest possible value for `m` is 5.
   - The `dp` list is initialized with specific values only up to index 5, and all other indices (from 6 onwards) are set to 0.

3. **Determine `dp[m]`**:
   - Given that `m` is at least 5, the possible values for `dp[m]` are either 81 (if `m` is exactly 5) or 0 (if `m` is greater than 5).

Since the problem does not specify the exact values of `n` and `num`, we cannot definitively say if `m` is exactly 5 or greater than 5. However, we know that `dp[m]` will be 81 if `m` is 5, and 0 for any `m` greater than 5.

Given the constraints and the initialization of `dp`, the most precise description of the output is:

- If `m` is 5, `dp[m]` is 81.
- If `m` is greater than 5, `dp[m]` is 0.

However, without additional information about `n` and `num`, we cannot pinpoint the exact value of `m`. Therefore, the output can be described as:

Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is 81 if m is 5, and 0 if m is greater than 5)**
