The given code initializes a new variable `num` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`. 

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `k` is the second integer read from the input, such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`; `num` is 0.**
