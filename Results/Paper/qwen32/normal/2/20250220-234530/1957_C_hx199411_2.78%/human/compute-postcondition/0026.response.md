Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1.
- `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- `k` is the second integer read from the input, such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`.
- `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on whether `c` equals `r` in each of the `k` iterations.
- `m` is `n - num`. The current value of `m` is 0.
- The provided code snippet is simply `print(0)`.

### Analysis:
The `print(0)` statement directly outputs the number 0, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, or `m`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print(0)` statement is always 0, irrespective of the values of the other variables.

Output: **0**
