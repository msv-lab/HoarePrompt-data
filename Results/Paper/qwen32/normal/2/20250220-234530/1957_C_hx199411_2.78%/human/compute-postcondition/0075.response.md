The code snippet assigns the value `3` to `dp[2]`. This change affects only the `dp` list, specifically the element at index `2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is the cumulative sum of increments (1 or 2) over `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num`, `m` is not equal to 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros with `dp[1]` set to 1 and `dp[2]` set to 3.**
