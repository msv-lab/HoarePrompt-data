To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we need to continue the pattern established in the provided output states. The loop iterates from `i = 3` to `m`, updating the `dp` list according to the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.

From the given states:
- After 1 iteration (`i = 3`), `dp[3] = 7`.
- After 2 iterations (`i = 4`), `dp[4] = 25`.
- After 3 iterations (`i = 5`), `dp[5] = 81`.

We need to compute the subsequent values up to `m`. Let's assume `m` is at least 6 to illustrate the next steps. We will calculate `dp[6]` and `dp[7]` as examples.

**Calculating `dp[6]`:**
\[ dp[6] = (dp[5] + (6 - 1) * dp[4] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[6] = (81 + 5 * 25 * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[6] = (81 + 250) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[6] = 331 \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[6] = 331 \]

**Calculating `dp[7]`:**
\[ dp[7] = (dp[6] + (7 - 1) * dp[5] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[7] = (331 + 6 * 81 * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[7] = (331 + 972) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[7] = 1303 \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[7] = 1303 \]

Continuing this process, we can compute further values if `m` is greater than 7. However, since the problem does not specify the exact value of `m`, we will assume `m = 5` based on the provided states, which means no further iterations are needed beyond `i = 5`.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations (up to `m = 5`) is:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer such that `n - num >= 3`, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is the cumulative sum of increments (1 or 2) over `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num` and `m` must be at least 5, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros with `dp[1]` set to 1, `dp[2]` set to 3, `dp[3]` set to 7, `dp[4]` set to 25, and `dp[5]` set to 81, `i` is 6.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` has been decremented by 1, `n` is an integer ensuring `m` is at least 5, `k` remains unchanged, `num` is the sum of the increments, `m` is calculated as `n - num`, and the `dp` list has been updated to `[0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81]`. The loop index `i` would be 6, indicating the loop has completed all necessary iterations up to `m`.
