Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `k` is greater than 0; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1. If `c` initially equaled `r`, `num` is set to 2, otherwise `num` is set to 3. If `c` did not initially equal `r`, `c` and `r` are updated to the new input values.**
