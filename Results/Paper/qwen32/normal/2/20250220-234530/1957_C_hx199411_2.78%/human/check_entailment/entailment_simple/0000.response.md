### Reasoning:

The problem involves determining the number of possible final configurations of a chessboard after a series of moves in a game involving white and black rooks. The key points to consider are:

1. **Initial Moves**: The player and the computer have already made `k` moves. For each move `(r, c)` made by the player, the computer mirrors it to `(c, r)` unless `r == c`, in which case the computer skips its turn.

2. **Remaining Moves**: After these initial moves, the player and the computer continue to place rooks until no more valid moves are possible. A valid move is one where no rook attacks another, meaning no two rooks can be in the same row or column.

3. **Configuration Counting**: The task is to count the number of distinct final configurations of the board modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Analysis of the Provided Program:

- **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the board size `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.

- **Counting Initial Moves**: It iterates through the `k` moves. For each move `(r, c)`, it increments a counter `num` by 1 if `r == c` (indicating the computer skipped its turn) and by 2 otherwise (indicating both the player and the computer made a move).

- **Remaining Positions**: The variable `m` is calculated as `n - num`, representing the number of positions left on the board after accounting for the initial moves.

- **Dynamic Programming**: If `m > 1`, the program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to fill the remaining positions without any rooks attacking each other. The base cases are `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`. The recurrence relation used is `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, which correctly counts the number of configurations for `m` positions.

- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where `m == 0` (no more moves possible, so only one configuration exists, which is the current board state) and `m == 1` (only one way to place a rook in the remaining position).

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, including handling the dynamic programming aspect for counting configurations and considering edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
