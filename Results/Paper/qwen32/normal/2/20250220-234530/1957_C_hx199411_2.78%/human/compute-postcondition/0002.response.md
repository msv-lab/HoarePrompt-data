Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`. Each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ `r_i`, `c_i` ≤ `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**

Natural Language: The value of `t` has been decremented by 1. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` was initially between 1 and 10^4 now means `t` is between 0 and 10^4 - 1.
