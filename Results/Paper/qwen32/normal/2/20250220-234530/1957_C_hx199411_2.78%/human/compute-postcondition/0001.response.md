To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the condition specified in the `while` loop. 

The `while` loop is given as:
```python
while t:
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is truthy (non-zero). Since `t` is described as "an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4", it is already guaranteed to be a positive integer, and thus truthy.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed to ensure that the loop executes at least once because the condition `t` being non-zero is already satisfied by the problem's constraints.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`. Each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ `r_i`, `c_i` ≤ `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
