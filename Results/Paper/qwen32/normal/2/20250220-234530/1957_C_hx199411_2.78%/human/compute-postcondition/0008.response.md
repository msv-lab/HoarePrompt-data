The value of `num` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `k` must be greater than 0; `num` is 1; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input, and `c` equals `r`.**
