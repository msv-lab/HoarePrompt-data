The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 6, and `m` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 7. The value of `m` does not need to change because the condition `i < m + 1` should still hold true for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is `2k - x` where `x` is the number of times `c == r` during the `k` iterations, `m` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[6]` which is 0, `i` is 7**
