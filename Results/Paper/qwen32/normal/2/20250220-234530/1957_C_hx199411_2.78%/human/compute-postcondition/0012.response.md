To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which is just `i` in this case. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `k`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1.
- `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- `k` is greater than 0.
- `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input.
- If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2.

From the loop statement:
```
for i in range(k):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken some value, say `i = x`. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` should now be `x + 1`.

Since none of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, `r`, `num`) are part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `k` is greater than 0; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2; `i` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `x`, we can generalize it to say that `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. Therefore, the most accurate representation without knowing the exact previous value of `i` is:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `k` is greater than 0; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

For simplicity and adhering to the given format, we can represent it as:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `k` is greater than 0; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2; `i` is incremented by 1**. 

But if we need to specify the exact state change, we can say:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `k` is greater than 0; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2; `i` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `x`, the most appropriate answer is:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `k` is greater than 0; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2; `i` is incremented by 1**. 

However, to match the format of the previous examples, we can simply say:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `k` is greater than 0; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2; `i` is incremented by 1**.

Let's finalize it as:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `k` is greater than 0; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2; `i` is incremented by 1**.

But for clarity and matching the format:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `k` is greater than 0; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2; `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**.

So the final answer is:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `k` is greater than 0; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2; `i` is incremented by 1**.

Let's box the final answer:

\[
\boxed{\text{State: } t \text{ is an input integer such that } 0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1; n \text{ is the first integer read from the input, such that } 1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5; k \text{ is greater than 0; } c \text{ and } r \text{ are the two integers read from the input. If } c \text{ equals } r, \text{ then } num \text{ is 1. Otherwise, } num \text{ is 2; } i \text{ is incremented by 1}}
