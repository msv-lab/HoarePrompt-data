In this task, the initial state only provides a condition about the relationship between `sumo` and `prod`, stating that `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`. However, the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `sumo` or `prod` at all. It simply prints `-1`.

Let's break it down:

- The `print(-1)` statement will execute regardless of the values of `sumo` and `prod`.
- The value to be printed is explicitly `-1`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is straightforward and does not require any additional context from the variables `sumo` and `prod`.

Output: **-1**
