You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

Example

Input

    6
    
    3
    
    3 2 7
    
    2
    
    3 3
    
    5
    
    5 5 5 5 5
    
    6
    
    7 9 3 17 9 13
    
    3
    
    6 3 2
    
    5
    
    9 4 6 8 3

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        bets = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        prod = 1
        for i in range(bets):
            prod *= a[i]
        sumo = 0
        for i in range(bets):
            a[i] = prod // a[i]
            sumo += int(a[i])
        if sumo >= prod:
            print(-1)
        else:
            ans = ''
            for i in range(bets):
                ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `k` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a modified list where each element is the product of all elements in `k` divided by the element itself. It then checks if the sum of the modified list is greater than or equal to the product of the original list. If so, it outputs `-1`; otherwise, it outputs the modified list elements separated by spaces.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's analyze the logic and see why it fails:

### Problem Analysis:
- We need to distribute `n` bets such that the total amount of coins bet (`sum(x_i)`) is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome (`k_i * x_i`).
- For each test case, we need to either find such a distribution or determine that it's impossible (`-1`).

### Program Analysis:
The program calculates a product of all multipliers (`prod`) and then divides this product by each multiplier to get the individual bets (`a[i] = prod // a[i]`). It then checks if the sum of these bets is less than the product. If not, it outputs `-1`.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Distribution Logic**: The approach of using the product of all multipliers and dividing it by each multiplier is flawed. This does not guarantee that the sum of the bets will be less than each `k_i * x_i`. In fact, this approach often results in very large numbers and doesn't ensure the required condition.
   
2. **Edge Cases**: The program might fail on simple cases where a straightforward distribution is possible. For example, if all `k_i` are the same, betting `1` on each outcome would satisfy the condition.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3
2 2 2
```
Expected output:
```
1 1 1
```
Explanation: Betting `1` on each outcome results in a total bet of `3`, which is less than `2 * 1 = 2` for each outcome, but since we need it to be strictly less than `2 * 1 = 2` for each outcome, this specific example is invalid. However, a valid distribution could be `1 1 1` because `1 < 2` for each outcome.

However, the program might output something like:
```
4 4 4
```
This is incorrect because `4 + 4 + 4 = 12` is not less than `2 * 4 = 8` for each outcome.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the problem requirements correctly and fails on several potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
