Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50. `k` remains a list of `n` integers where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20. `bets` remains an integer greater than or equal to 1. `a` has its first `bets` elements updated to `prod // a[i]` for `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`. `prod` remains the product of the original first `bets` elements of the list `a`. `sumo` is the sum of the updated first `bets` elements of `a`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, no further action is taken. Otherwise, the string representation of the first `bets` elements of the list `a` (after they have been updated), each followed by a space, is produced.**
