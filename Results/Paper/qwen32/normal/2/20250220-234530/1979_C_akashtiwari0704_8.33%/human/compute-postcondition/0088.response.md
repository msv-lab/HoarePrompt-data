The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` adds the integer value of `a[i]` to the current value of `sumo`. Given that `i` is 0, this means `sumo` will be updated by adding `int(a[0])` to it.

Since `a[0]` was previously modified to `prod // a[0]`, we need to reflect this in the calculation. However, the problem does not specify the exact values of `prod` and `a[0]` before this modification, so we'll represent the new value of `a[0]` as `prod // a[0]`.

Thus, the new value of `sumo` will be `sumo + (prod // a[0])`.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` remains a list of `n` integers where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20, `bets` must be at least 1, `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of `a`, `sumo` is `sumo + (prod // a[0])`, `T` is `T + 1`, `a[0]` is `prod // a[0]`, `i` is 0.**
