The given code snippet reads a list of integers from the user input and assigns it to the variable `a`. This operation overwrites the previous value of `a` with the new list of integers provided by the user.

Given the initial state, the following variables remain unchanged:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
- `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50
- `k` remains a list of `n` integers where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20
- `bets` is the integer input by the user
- `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of `a` (before the update)
- `sumo` is the sum of the first `bets` elements of `a` (before the update)
- `T` is `T + 1`

The variable `a` is updated to the new list of integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` remains a list of `n` integers where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20, `bets` is the integer input by the user, `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of `a` (before the update), `sumo` is the sum of the first `bets` elements of `a` (before the update), `T` is `T + 1`, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user input.**
