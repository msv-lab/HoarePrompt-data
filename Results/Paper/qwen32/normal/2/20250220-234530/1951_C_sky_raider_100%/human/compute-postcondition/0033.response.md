The value of `c` is incremented by `s * (l[i] + t)`. Given that `i` is 0, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, and `n` must be greater than 0, the new value of `c` is `c + s * (l[0] + t)`. The values of `m`, `k`, `l`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m`, `k`, `l`, `t` remain unchanged, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is `c + s * (l[0] + t)`**.
