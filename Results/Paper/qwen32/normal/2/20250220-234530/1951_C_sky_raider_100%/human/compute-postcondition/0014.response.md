Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `t` is `s`
- `n` must be greater than `s + 1`
- `m` is an integer read from the input
- `k` is an integer read from the input minus `s`
- `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input
- `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`
- `c` is `c + s * l[i]`
- `i` is `s + 1`

Code Snippet:
```python
c += s * (l[i] + t)
```

Impact of the Code:
- The variable `c` is updated by adding `s * (l[i] + t)` to its current value.
- Since `t` is `s`, the expression becomes `c += s * (l[i] + s)`.
- This means `c` is incremented by `s * (l[i] + s)`.

Output State:
- `t` remains `s`
- `n` remains greater than `s + 1`
- `m` remains the same integer read from the input
- `k` remains the same integer read from the input minus `s`
- `l` remains the same sorted list of integers read from the input
- `s` remains the minimum of `m` and `k`
- `c` is now `c + s * (l[i] + s)`
- `i` remains `s + 1`

Output State: **`t` is `s`; `n` must be greater than `s + 1`; `m` is an integer read from the input; `k` is an integer read from the input minus `s`; `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`; `c` is `c + s * (l[i] + s)`; `i` is `s + 1`**
