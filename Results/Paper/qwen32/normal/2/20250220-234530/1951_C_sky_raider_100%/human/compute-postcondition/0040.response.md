The code snippet provided is `k -= s`. This means that the value of `k` will be reduced by the value of `s`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `m` remains unchanged
- `k` is `k - s`
- `l` remains unchanged
- `s` is `min(m, k - s)`
- `t` is `t + 2*s`
- `c` is `c + s * (l[1] + t + s)`

After executing `k -= s`, the value of `k` will be further reduced by `s`. So, the new value of `k` will be `k - s - s` or `k - 2*s`.

Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` remains unchanged, `k` is `k - 2*s`, `l` remains unchanged, `s` is `min(m, k - s)`, `t` is `t + 2*s`, `c` is `c + s * (l[1] + t + s)`**

In natural language, this means that `k` has been decreased by an additional `s`, making its new value `k - 2*s`. All other variables remain unchanged except for `k`.
