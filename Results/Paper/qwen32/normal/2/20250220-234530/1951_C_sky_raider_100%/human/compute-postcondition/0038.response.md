The given code modifies the value of `c` by adding `s * (l[i] + t)` to it. Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `i` remains 1.
- `n` remains greater than 1.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `k` remains `k - s`.
- `l` remains unchanged.
- `s` remains `min(m, k - s)`.
- `t` remains `t + s`.
- `c` is updated to `c + s * (l[i] + t)`.

Given these updates, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` remains unchanged, `k` is `k - s`, `l` remains unchanged, `s` is `min(m, k - s)`, `t` is `t + s`, `c` is `c + s * (l[1] + t + s)`**.

This means that `c` has been incremented by `s * (l[1] + t + s)`.
