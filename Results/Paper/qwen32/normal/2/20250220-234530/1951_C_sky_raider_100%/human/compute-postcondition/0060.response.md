The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, which means the loop condition `i < n` is no longer satisfied, and thus the loop does not execute again. To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n`.

Since `i` is currently equal to `n`, we need to decrease `i` by 1 to make it `n-1`. This way, the condition `i < n` will be true, and the loop can execute again.

State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input minus `S_total` minus `min(m, k)`, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `t` is `min(m, k)`, `c` is `c + min(m, k) * l[n]`, `s` is `min(m, k)`**
