In the given task, the loop is defined as `for i in range(int(input())):`. This means that the loop variable `i` is the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted. The other variables mentioned (`t`, `k`, `c`, `n`, `m`, `l`, and `s`) are either not part of the loop head or are recalculated within the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t = n * s`
- `k = k_initial - n * s`
- `c = sum(s * (l[i] + i * s) for i in range(n))`
- `n`, `m`, `l` remain unchanged.
- `s` remains the same as it is recalculated in each iteration based on the current value of `k`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment the loop variable `i` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `c`, `n`, `m`, `l`, and `s`) should remain as they are because they are not part of the loop head and are recalculated or remain unchanged within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t = n * s`, `k = k_initial - n * s`, `c = sum(s * (l[i] + i * s) for i in range(n))`, `n` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `s` remains the same, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since we are only adjusting the loop variable `i` in the loop head, the final state in the required format is:

State: **`t = n * s`, `k = k_initial - n * s`, `c = sum(s * (l[i] + i * s) for i in range(n))`, `n` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `s` remains the same, `i` is `i + 1`**.

However, to match the exact format of previous examples, we can write:

State: **`t = n * s`, `k = k_initial - n * s`, `c = sum(s * (l[i] + i * s) for i in range(n))`, `n` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `s` remains the same, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Simplifying it to reflect only the change in `i`:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`**

So the final answer is:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`**
