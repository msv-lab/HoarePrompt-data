To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze how the variables change with each iteration and generalize these changes over all `n` iterations.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `t = 0`
   - `n`: number of iterations (read from input)
   - `m`: integer read from input
   - `k`: integer read from input
   - `l`: sorted list of integers read from input
   - `s = 0`
   - `c = 0`

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each iteration `i` from `0` to `n-1`:
     - `s = min(m, k)`
     - `c += s * (l[i] + t)`
     - `t += s`
     - `k -= s`

3. **Generalizing the Changes:**
   - After each iteration `i`:
     - `t` accumulates `s` for each iteration, so `t = i * s`.
     - `k` decreases by `s` for each iteration, so `k = k_initial - i * s`.
     - `c` accumulates `s * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration, so `c = sum(s * (l[i] + (i * s)) for i in range(n))`.

4. **Final Output State:**
   - After `n` iterations:
     - `t = n * s`
     - `k = k_initial - n * s`
     - `c = sum(s * (l[i] + i * s) for i in range(n))`
     - `n`, `m`, `l` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
     - `s` remains the same as it is recalculated in each iteration based on the current value of `k`.

Let's express this in the required format:

Output State: **`t` is `n * s`; `n` is the number of iterations; `m` is an integer read from the input; `k` is an integer read from the input minus `n * s`; `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` (where `k` was originally an integer read from the input minus `(n-1) * s`); `c` is the sum of `s * (l[i] + i * s)` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations:
- `t` will be `n` times the value of `s` calculated in the last iteration.
- `k` will have decreased by `n` times the value of `s` calculated in each iteration.
- `c` will be the accumulated sum of `s * (l[i] + i * s)` for all iterations.
- `n`, `m`, and `l` remain unchanged.
- `s` is recalculated in each iteration but retains its final value for the last iteration in the context of the final output.
