The code snippet `t += s` increments the variable `t` by the value of `s`. Given the initial state, `t` was `0` and `s` is `min(m, k)`. After executing the code, `t` will be equal to `s`.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input minus `S_total`, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `t` is `min(m, k)`, `c` is `c + min(m, k) * l[n]`, `s` is `min(m, k)`**.
