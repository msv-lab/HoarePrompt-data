The code increments the value of `x` by 1. Given that the initial value of `x` is 3, after the increment, `x` becomes 4. The values of `y` and `cnt` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`x` is 4, `y` is 4, `cnt` is the initial `cnt` plus `min(n // 15, m // 10)` if `gcd(3, 2) == 1`.**
