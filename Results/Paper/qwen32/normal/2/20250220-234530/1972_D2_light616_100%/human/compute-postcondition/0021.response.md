The value of `y` is reassigned to 1. The values of `x`, `y_final`, `cnt`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 1, `y_final` is the largest integer such that `(1 + y_final) * y_final > m`, `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // (1 + y), m // ((1 + y) * y))` for all `y` from 2 to `y_final`, and `n` must be at least 9.**
