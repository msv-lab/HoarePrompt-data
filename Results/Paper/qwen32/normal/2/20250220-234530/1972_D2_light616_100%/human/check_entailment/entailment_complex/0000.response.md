### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem statement.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

#### Code Analysis:
The code consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is responsible for processing a single test case.
   - It reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).
   - It iterates over possible values of \(x\) starting from 1 up to the square root of \(n\).
   - For each \(x\), it iterates over possible values of \(y\) starting from 1.
   - It checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) (i.e., \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime).
   - If they are coprime, it increments the count by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x+y)x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x+y)y} \right\rfloor\).
   - Finally, it prints the count.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case.

#### Verification Against the Problem Statement:
- The code correctly iterates over possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) indirectly via \(x\) and \(y\).
- The condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) ensures that \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, which is a necessary part of the problem statement.
- The count is incremented based on the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x+y)x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x+y)y} \right\rfloor\). This logic is derived from the requirement that \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) must be a multiple of \(a + b\). Since \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), this simplifies to checking the divisibility condition indirectly via the floor division.
- The code handles multiple test cases as required.

Given the above analysis, the code appears to correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
