Since the code snippet provided is simply calling `func_1()` again without any changes to the variables `t` or any other variables mentioned in the initial state, the state of `t` remains unchanged. The function `func_1()` being called does not affect the value of `t` or introduce any new variables unless specified within the function itself, which is not detailed here.

Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State except for the fact that `func_1()` has been called again.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where `0 <= t <= 10^4` (after decrementing by 1 from the previous value); `func_1()` has been called twice.**
