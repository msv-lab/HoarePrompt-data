### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Code Analysis:
The code consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - Reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).
  - Initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
  - Iterates over possible values of `x` up to the square root of `n`.
  - For each `x`, iterates over possible values of `y` such that \((x + y) * x \leq n\) and \((x + y) * y \leq m\).
  - Checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). If true, it increments `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) * x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) * y} \right\rfloor\).
  - Prints the final count `cnt`.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - Calls `func_1` for each test case.

#### Verification:
To verify the correctness, we need to check if the logic inside `func_1` correctly counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).

1. **Loop Conditions:**
   - The outer loop runs from \(x = 1\) to \(x = \sqrt{n}\). This ensures that we consider all possible values of \(x\) within the range.
   - The inner loop runs from \(y = 1\) to values where \((x + y) * x \leq n\) and \((x + y) * y \leq m\). This ensures that we consider all possible values of \(y\) for each \(x\).

2. **GCD Check:**
   - The condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) is checked to ensure that \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime. This is a necessary part of the solution because if \(\gcd(x, y) > 1\), the expression \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) might not be a multiple of \(a + b\) even if \(a\) and \(b\) are multiples of \(x\) and \(y\), respectively.

3. **Counting Valid Pairs:**
   - For each pair \((x, y)\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), the code calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) by taking the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) * x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) * y} \right\rfloor\). This ensures that we count all valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a\) is a multiple of \(x\) and \(b\) is a multiple of \(y\).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases such as \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1\) correctly, as demonstrated by the example output.

Based on the above analysis, the code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
