### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to determine if the solution is correct.

#### Problem Breakdown:
- We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
- For each test case, we need to compute the count of such pairs and output it.

#### Analysis of Provided Code:
- The main function `func_2` handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1` for each test case.
- `func_1` is responsible for solving a single test case. Here's what it does:
  - It initializes `cnt` to 0, which will hold the count of valid pairs.
  - It reads `n` and `m` from the input.
  - It iterates over possible values of `x` starting from 1 up to \(\sqrt{n}\).
  - For each `x`, it iterates over possible values of `y` starting from 1.
  - It checks if `gcd(x, y) == 1` (i.e., `x` and `y` are coprime).
  - It checks if \((x + y) * x \leq n\) and \((x + y) * y \leq m\).
  - If the above conditions are met, it increments `cnt` by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.
  - Finally, it prints the count `cnt`.

#### Correctness Check:
- The logic in `func_1` seems to be attempting to count the number of valid pairs by iterating over possible values of `x` and `y` and checking the conditions specified in the problem.
- However, the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` is not directly checked in the provided code. Instead, the code uses a mathematical approach to count pairs based on the constraints and properties of coprime numbers.
- The code leverages the fact that if `gcd(x, y) == 1`, then the pairs \((a, b)\) can be counted by considering multiples of \((x, y)\) that fit within the bounds of `n` and `m`.

Given the complexity of the problem and the provided solution, the approach taken in `func_1` seems to be an optimized way to count the pairs without explicitly iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\). The provided execution summary suggests that the function correctly counts the pairs based on the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
