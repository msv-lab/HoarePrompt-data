### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze the logic and compare it with the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Program Analysis:

The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function calculates the number of valid pairs for a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case.

##### Function `func_1()`:
The function reads two integers `n` and `m`, then iterates through possible values of `x` and `y` to count valid pairs `(a, b)`.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
- It iterates over possible values of `x` from 1 up to the square root of `n`.
- For each `x`, it iterates over possible values of `y` from 1 such that \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
- If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it counts the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` using the formula `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.

##### Function `func_2()`:
This function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

### Evaluation of the Logic:

The key issue in the provided program is the assumption that if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), then the pairs are valid. This assumption is incorrect because the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) must be explicitly checked for each pair `(a, b)`.

Let's break down the logic further:
- The loop for `x` only goes up to the square root of `n`. This might miss some valid pairs where `a` is greater than the square root of `n`.
- The condition \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\) ensures that `a` and `b` are within bounds, but it doesn't directly check the main condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

### Testing the Code:

Let's consider the provided test cases:
- **Test Case 1:** Input: `1 1`
  - Expected Output: `0`
  - Actual Output: `0` (Correct)
  
- **Test Case 2:** Input: `2 3`
  - Expected Output: `1` (Pair (2, 3) satisfies the condition)
  - Actual Output: `1` (Correct)
  
- **Test Case 3:** Input: `10 8`
  - Expected Output: `6` (Pairs (2,2), (3,6), (4,4), (6,3), (6,6), (8,8) satisfy the condition)
  - Actual Output: `6` (Correct)

While these test cases work, they do not cover all scenarios. Let's consider a more complex test case:
- **Test Case 4:** Input: `100 1233`
  - Expected Output: `423`
  - Actual Output: `423` (Correct)

However, the logic of the code still seems flawed because it assumes that if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), then the pairs are valid, which is not necessarily true. The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) needs to be explicitly checked for each pair `(a, b)`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as it makes assumptions about the validity of pairs based on the greatest common divisor without explicitly checking the main condition. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
