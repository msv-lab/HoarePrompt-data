To determine the output state, let's evaluate the given code snippet step-by-step:

Given:
- `x` is 3
- `y` is 2
- `n` must be at least 15

The code snippet:
```python
cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
```

First, let's compute the expressions inside the `min` function:
- `(x + y) * x` evaluates to `(3 + 2) * 3 = 5 * 3 = 15`
- `(x + y) * y` evaluates to `(3 + 2) * 2 = 5 * 2 = 10`

Now, substituting these into the `min` function:
- `n // ((x + y) * x)` becomes `n // 15`
- `m // ((x + y) * y)` becomes `m // 10`

Since `n` must be at least 15, `n // 15` will be at least 1 (assuming `n` is exactly 15 or more).

The value of `m` is not specified, so `m // 10` could be any non-negative integer depending on the value of `m`.

Let's denote `n // 15` as `A` and `m // 10` as `B`. The `min(A, B)` will be the smaller of these two values.

Thus, `cnt` will be incremented by the smaller of `n // 15` and `m // 10`.

Since the exact value of `m` is not given, we cannot determine the exact value of `cnt` increment. However, we know that `cnt` will increase by either `n // 15` or `m // 10`, whichever is smaller.

Output State: **`x` is 3, `y` is 2, `n` must be at least 15, `cnt` is incremented by the smaller of `n // 15` and `m // 10`.**
