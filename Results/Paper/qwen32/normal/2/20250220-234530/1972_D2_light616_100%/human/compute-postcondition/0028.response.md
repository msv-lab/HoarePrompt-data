To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

Given:
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 2
- `n` is at least 9
- `m` must be at least 9
- `y_final` is the largest integer such that `(1 + y_final) * y_final > m`.

The code snippet is:
```python
cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
```

Let's break down the calculations:

1. Calculate `(x + y) * x`:
   \[
   (x + y) * x = (2 + 2) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8
   \]

2. Calculate `n // ((x + y) * x)`:
   Since `n` is at least 9,
   \[
   n // 8 \geq 9 // 8 = 1
   \]
   So, `n // 8` is at least 1.

3. Calculate `(x + y) * y`:
   \[
   (x + y) * y = (2 + 2) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8
   \]

4. Calculate `m // ((x + y) * y)`:
   Since `m` is at least 9,
   \[
   m // 8 \geq 9 // 8 = 1
   \]
   So, `m // 8` is at least 1.

5. Determine `min(n // 8, m // 8)`:
   Both `n // 8` and `m // 8` are at least 1, so the minimum value is at least 1.

6. Update `cnt`:
   \[
   cnt += \text{min}(n // 8, m // 8)
   \]
   Since both `n // 8` and `m // 8` are at least 1, `cnt` is incremented by at least 1.

The other variables (`x`, `y`, `n`, `m`, `y_final`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 2, `n` is at least 9, `m` must be at least 9, `y_final` is the largest integer such that `(1 + y_final) * y_final > m`, `cnt` is incremented by at least 1.**
