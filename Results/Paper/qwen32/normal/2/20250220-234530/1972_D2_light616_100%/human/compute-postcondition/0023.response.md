Postcondition: **`x` is 2, `y` is 1, `n` is at least 9, `m` is at least 3, `y_final` is the largest integer such that `(1 + y_final) * y_final > m`, and `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // (1 + y), m // ((1 + y) * y))` for all `y` from 2 to `y_final`. Additionally, the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1.**
