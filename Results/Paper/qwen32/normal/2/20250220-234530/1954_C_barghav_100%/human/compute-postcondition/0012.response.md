Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, where 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100; `a` is a list of digits from the input string `s` that must have at least one element; `b` is a list of characters from the new input string. If `a[i]` was originally less than `b[i]`, then `f` is set to 1, `a[i]` is now the previous `b[i]`, and `b[i]` is now the previous `a[i]`. If `a[i]` was originally greater than or equal to `b[i]`, then `f` is set to 1 if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, otherwise `f` remains 0, and `a[i]` remains greater than or equal to `b[i]`.**
