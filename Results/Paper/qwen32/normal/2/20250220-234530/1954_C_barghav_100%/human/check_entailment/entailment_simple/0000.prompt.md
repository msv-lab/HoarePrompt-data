Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

# Annotated Program:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, x and y are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, where 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100.

    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())

        if f == 0:
            if a[i] < b[i]:

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, where 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100; `a` is a list of digits from the input string `s` such that no element in `a` is less than the corresponding element in `b`; `b` is a list of characters from the new input string; `f` is 1 if any swap occurred during the loop, otherwise, it remains 0.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: The loop prints all elements of `a` concatenated together, and the values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, and `f` remain unchanged.
    print()
    #This is printed: (newline)
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
        
    #State: All elements of `b` are printed concatenated together, and `t`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `f` remain unchanged, `i` is `len(b) - 1`.
    print()
    #This is printed: (an empty line)
