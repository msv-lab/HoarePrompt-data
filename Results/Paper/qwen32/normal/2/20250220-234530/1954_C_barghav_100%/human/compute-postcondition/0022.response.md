Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, where 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100; `a` is a list of digits from the input string `s` that must have at least one element; `b` is a list of characters from the new input string; `f` is 1 if `a[i] > b[i]`, otherwise `f` remains unchanged; `i` is i + 1.**
