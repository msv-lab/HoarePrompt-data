To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the given information:

- `b` is a list with at least two elements.
- `i` is set to 2.

Given these conditions, we know that `b[i]` refers to the element at index 2 of the list `b`. Since the exact contents of the list `b` are not specified, we cannot determine the precise value of `b[2]`. However, we do know that it exists because `b` has at least two elements, and thus an index of 2 is valid.

The `end=''` parameter in the `print` function indicates that no newline character will be added after the printed content.

Therefore, the output will be the element at index 2 of the list `b`, without any additional characters following it.

Output: **b[2] (where b[2] is the element at index 2 of the list b)**
