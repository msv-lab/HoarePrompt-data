To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information:

- We have several variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `f`) mentioned but their specific values are not provided. They remain unchanged, so we don't need to consider them further for this print statement.
- `b` is a list with at least one element.
- `i` is a variable whose value is not explicitly stated in the initial conditions, but it is used as an index to access an element in the list `b`.

Given this information, the print statement `print(b[i], end='')` will output the element at index `i` of the list `b`. Since the value of `i` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact element that will be printed. However, we know that `i` must be a valid index for the list `b` (i.e., `0 <= i < len(b)`).

Thus, the output will be the element at index `i` of the list `b`.

Output: **b[i] (where b is the list and i is a valid index for the list b)**
