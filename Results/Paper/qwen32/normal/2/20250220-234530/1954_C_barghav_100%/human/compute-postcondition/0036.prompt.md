Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, where 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100; `a` is a list of digits from the input string `s`; `b` is a list of characters from the new input string; `f` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if f == 0:
        if a[i] < b[i]:
            a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
            f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            f = 1
    elif a[i] > b[i]:
        a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, where 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100; `a` is a list of digits from the input string `s` that must have at least one element; `b` is a list of characters from the new input string. If `f` was initially 0, then at the current index `i`, if `a[i]` was originally less than `b[i]`, `f` is set to 1, `a[i]` is swapped with `b[i]`. If `a[i]` was originally greater than or equal to `b[i]`, `f` is set to 1 if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, otherwise `f` remains 0, and `a[i]` remains greater than or equal to `b[i]`. If `f` was not 0, no changes occur at index `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, where 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100; `a` is a list of digits from the input string `s` with the element at index `i` swapped with the element at index `i` in `b` if `a[i] < b[i]` or `a[i] > b[i]`; `b` is a list of characters from the new input string with the element at index `i` swapped with the element at index `i` in `a` if `a[i] < b[i]` or `a[i] > b[i]`; `f` is 1 if `a[i] < b[i]` or `a[i] > b[i]`, otherwise `f` remains unchanged; `i` is `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, where 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100. `a` is a list of digits from the input string `s` with the element at index `i` swapped with the element at index `i` in `b` if `a[i] < b[i]` or `a[i] > b[i]`. `b` is a list of characters from the new input string with the element at index `i` swapped with the element at index `i` in `a` if `a[i] < b[i]` or `a[i] > b[i]`. `f` is 1 if `a[i] < b[i]` or `a[i] > b[i]`, otherwise `f` remains unchanged. `i` is `i + 1`. If `f` was 0 before the if-else block, the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged at index `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
