### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective**: Sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings.
- **Operation**: Cyclic shift on a substring `s[l...r]` has a cost of `r - l + 1`.
- **Goal**: Find the minimum total cost to sort the string.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The code reads multiple test cases and processes each binary string using the `func_1` function. Here's a detailed breakdown of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
    left = 0
    cost = 0
    right = 1
    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            (s[right], s[left]) = (s[left], s[right])
            cost += right - left + 1
        while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
            right += 1
        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1
    return cost
```

##### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Loop Condition**:
   - The condition `left <= right` allows `left` to be equal to `right`, which can lead to unnecessary iterations and incorrect results.
   
2. **Incorrect Simulation of Cyclic Shift**:
   - The code swaps elements directly in the list, which does not simulate a cyclic shift on a substring. A cyclic shift involves moving a segment of the string around, not just swapping two elements.
   
3. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost calculation assumes that swapping two elements is equivalent to a cyclic shift, which is incorrect. The cost should reflect the actual length of the substring being shifted.
   
4. **Flawed Logic for Finding Minimum Cost**:
   - The logic for finding the minimum cost is flawed. The program does not correctly account for the cost of performing cyclic shifts on substrings to achieve the desired sorted order.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary states that `func_1` takes a list of binary strings (`sChar`) as input and returns the accumulated cost associated with swapping '0's and '1's to achieve a certain configuration within the combined string. This summary does not align with the problem's requirement of performing cyclic shifts and calculating their costs correctly.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly simulate cyclic shifts and calculate their costs, leading to incorrect results. The logic for achieving the minimum cost to sort the string is flawed.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
