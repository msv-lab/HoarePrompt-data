To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute at least once, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition:

```python
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop will execute if both conditions are true:
1. `left < len(s)`
2. `s[left] != '1'`

Given the state right before the loop:
- `right` is `len(s)`
- `left` is the index of the first '1' in `s`.

Let's break down the requirements:

1. **Condition `left < len(s)`**: 
   - Since `right` is `len(s)`, this condition will always be true as long as `left` is less than `right`. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for this part.

2. **Condition `s[left] != '1'`**:
   - The problem states that `left` is the index of the first '1' in `s`. This means that `s[left]` is already '1', which makes the condition `s[left] != '1'` false. Therefore, the loop will not execute with the current state.

To make the loop execute at least once, we need to adjust `left` so that it points to a character in `s` that is not '1'. Here are the steps to achieve this:

- We need to set `left` to an index where `s[left]` is not '1'.
- Since `left` is currently the index of the first '1', we can adjust `left` to point to an earlier position in the string, ensuring that `s[left]` is not '1'.

However, since the problem specifies that `left` is initially the index of the first '1', we need to consider the possibility that there might be no '1' in the string at all. In that case, `left` would be out of bounds or undefined. To simplify, let's assume there is at least one '1' in the string, and we need to move `left` to a valid position before the first '1'.

### Adjusted State:
- `left` should be set to an index where `s[left]` is not '1'. The simplest way to ensure this is to set `left` to 0, assuming `s[0]` is not '1'. If `s[0]` is '1', we need to find the next valid index.

Since the exact content of `s` is not specified, we'll assume the simplest case where `s[0]` is not '1'.

State: **`right` is `len(s)`, `left` is 0**
