The code appends the variable `i` to the list `s`. Initially, `s` contains only one element, which is `sChar[1]`. After the append operation, `s` will have two elements: the original `sChar[1]` and the new element `i`.

Given the initial state, `sChar` remains unchanged. The only change is in the list `s`, which now includes the additional element `i`.

Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, the total length of all strings in `sChar` does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `sChar` must contain at least two strings; `s` is a list containing the elements `sChar[1]` and `i`.**
