Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\); `s` is a list that contains all the elements of `sChar` with `s[0]` being '0', `s[1]` being '0', and `s[2]` being '0'; `left` is 3; `right` is len(s)**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `left` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
