To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head:

```python
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
    # the loop body is omit
```

From this, we can infer that two conditions must be satisfied for the loop to execute:
1. `left < len(s)` - This ensures that the index `left` is within the bounds of the string `s`.
2. `s[left] != '1'` - This ensures that the character at index `left` in the string `s` is not '1'.

Given the initial state:
- `right` is `len(s)`
- `left` is `3`
- No changes to `s` or `cost`

Let's analyze the conditions:

1. **Condition 1**: `left < len(s)`
   - Given `left` is `3`, `len(s)` must be greater than `3` for this condition to hold true.

2. **Condition 2**: `s[left] != '1'`
   - Given `left` is `3`, the character at index `3` in the string `s` must not be '1'. 

Since no changes are allowed to `s` or `cost`, we need to ensure that the initial length of `s` is greater than `3` and that the character at index `3` is not '1'.

Therefore, the modified state should reflect these conditions:

State: **`right` is `len(s)`, `left` is `3`, `len(s)` must be greater than `3`, and `s[3]` must not be '1'**
