#State of the program right berfore the function call: sChar is a list of strings where each string s consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string s satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, the total length of all strings in sChar does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

    #The program returns the accumulated cost from all swaps.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of binary strings (`sChar`) as input and returns the accumulated cost associated with swapping '0's and '1's to achieve a certain configuration within the combined string.
