The code snippet `cost += right - left + 1` adds the value of `right - left + 1` to the variable `cost`. Given the initial state, `right` is `len(s) - 1` and `left` is `3`. Therefore, the value added to `cost` is `(len(s) - 1) - 3 + 1`, which simplifies to `len(s) - 3`.

The characters at indices `right` and `left` in `s` being swapped does not affect the calculation of `cost`. Thus, the only change is in the value of `cost`.

Output State: **`right` is `len(s) - 1`, `left` is `3`, the characters at indices `right` and `left` in `s` are swapped, `cost` is increased by `len(s) - 3`.**
