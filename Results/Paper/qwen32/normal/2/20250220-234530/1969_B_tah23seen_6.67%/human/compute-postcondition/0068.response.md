Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `sChar`, which is a list of strings where each string consists only of '0' and '1' characters, with each string having a length between 2 and 2 * 10^5, and the total length of all strings not exceeding 2 * 10^5. The function returns the accumulated cost from all necessary swaps to achieve a specific configuration of the strings.**
