### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to see if it correctly implements the solution.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Inputs**:
   - Number of children, `n`.
   - Number of pairs of friends, `m`.
   - Number of excursions, `k`.
   - List of friendships with their initial friendship values.

2. **Objective**:
   - Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - Return the result as `p * q^-1 % (10^9 + 7)` where `p/q` is the expected value in simplest form.

3. **Key Points**:
   - Each pair of friends starts with an initial friendship value.
   - When a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The probability of choosing any pair is equal.
   - The expected value calculation involves the sum of arithmetic series.

#### Code Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - This function takes `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` as inputs.
  - It iterates through each friendship and calculates the contribution of that friendship to the total sum using the formula `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`.
  - The formula `k * (k + 1) // 2` represents the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is the expected sum of friendship values for a pair chosen `k` times.
  - The result is accumulated and returned modulo `MOD`.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - This function handles multiple test cases.
  - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of friendships.
  - It calls `func_1` to compute the result for each test case and prints it.

#### Verification Against Example:
- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `100 0 24`
  - Output: `0`
  - Explanation: No friends, so the sum of friendship values is `0`.

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `2 1 10` followed by `1 2 1`
  - Output: `55`
  - Explanation: The sum of the first 10 natural numbers is `55`.

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `5 2 4` followed by `1 2 25` and `3 2 24`
  - Output: `777777784`
  - Explanation: The expected value is `7/9`, and `7 * 9^-1 % (10^9 + 7)` equals `777777784`.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all excursions. It handles multiple test cases and computes the result as required.

### Correctness: **True**
