### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step to determine if the solution is correct.

#### Problem Understanding:
- We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for k excursions.
- The friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time the pair is chosen.
- The output should be the expected sum modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Key Points:
1. **Friendship Value Calculation**:
   - For each pair of friends with initial friendship value \(f_i\), the expected contribution to the sum over \(k\) excursions is \(f_i \times \left(\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\right)\).
   - This is because the sum of the first \(k\) natural numbers is \(\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\), and each time the pair is chosen, the friendship value increases by 1.

2. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Since the result can be large, we need to take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program handles multiple test cases, reading the number of test cases first, then processing each test case individually.

#### Code Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - Takes parameters \(n\), \(m\), \(k\), and `friendships`.
  - Iterates through each friendship and calculates the contribution to the result using the formula \(f_i \times \left(\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\right)\).
  - Sums up these contributions and returns the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - Reads the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, reads \(n\), \(m\), \(k\), and the list of friendships.
  - Calls `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result.

#### Verification:
- The logic in `func_1` correctly computes the expected sum of friendship values for each pair of friends.
- The use of modulo \(10^9 + 7\) ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.
- The program correctly processes multiple test cases as described.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. It efficiently calculates the expected sum of friendship values for each test case and handles the constraints appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
