Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for `k` excursions, where the friendship value of a pair increases by 1 every time that pair is chosen. This expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and we need to output \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

### Key Points:
1. **Friendship Value Increase**: Each time a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1.
2. **Expected Value Calculation**: The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` excursions needs to be computed.
3. **Fraction Representation**: The result should be represented as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and the output is \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the provided code:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - This function calculates the result for a single test case.
  - It iterates through each friendship and adds the product of the initial friendship value `f` and the sum of the first `k` natural numbers (`k * (k + 1) // 2`) to the result.
  - The sum of the first `k` natural numbers is used because if a pair is chosen `k` times, the contribution to the sum of friendship values is \(f + (f+1) + (f+2) + ... + (f+k-1)\), which simplifies to \(k \cdot f + (0 + 1 + 2 + ... + (k-1)) = k \cdot f + \frac{k(k-1)}{2}\).
  - However, the code uses `k * (k + 1) // 2`, which seems incorrect. It should be `k * f + (k * (k - 1) // 2)`.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - This function reads the input for multiple test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
  - It prints the result for each test case.

### Correctness Check:
The main issue with the provided code lies in the calculation inside `func_1`. The formula used for calculating the contribution of each friendship is incorrect. The correct formula should be `k * f + (k * (k - 1) // 2)` instead of `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2)`.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis above, the provided program is incorrect due to the incorrect formula used in `func_1`.

Correctness: **False**
