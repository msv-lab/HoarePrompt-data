Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer representing the number of children such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `m` is an integer representing the number of pairs of friends such that 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2), `k` is an integer representing the number of excursions such that 1 <= k <= 2*10^5, and `friendships` is a list of lists where each sublist contains three integers a_i, b_i, f_i representing a pair of friends and their friendship value such that a_i != b_i, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9. All pairs of friends are distinct; `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
    result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists where each sublist contains three integers read from the input, `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists where each sublist contains three integers read from the input, `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)` and has been updated to the value returned by `func_1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists where each sublist contains three integers read from the input, `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
