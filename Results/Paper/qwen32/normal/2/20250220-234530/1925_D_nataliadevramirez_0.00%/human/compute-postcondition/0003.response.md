The given code snippet reads `m` lines of input, where each line contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`. These integers are used to form sublists which are then added to the `friendships` list.

Given the initial state, `friendships` was initially a list of lists where each sublist contained three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, `f_i`. After executing the code, `friendships` will be updated to contain `m` new sublists, each representing the three integers read from the input.

Since `n`, `m`, `k`, and `t` are not modified by this code snippet, their values remain unchanged. The only change is in the `friendships` list, which now contains `m` sublists of integers.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists where each sublist contains three integers read from the input, `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.**
