The code snippet provided reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This does not affect the initial state of `n`, `m`, `k`, or `friendships`. The only change is the introduction of the new variable `t`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of children such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `m` is an integer representing the number of pairs of friends such that 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2), `k` is an integer representing the number of excursions such that 1 <= k <= 2*10^5, and `friendships` is a list of lists where each sublist contains three integers a_i, b_i, f_i representing a pair of friends and their friendship value such that a_i != b_i, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9. All pairs of friends are distinct; `t` is an input integer.**
