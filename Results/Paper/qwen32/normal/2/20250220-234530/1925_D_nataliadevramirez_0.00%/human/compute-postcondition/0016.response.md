To determine the output state after the loop executes all its iterations, we need to consider how the loop processes its inputs and updates its state with each iteration. The loop reads input parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` for each iteration, computes a result using `func_1`, and prints it. The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided as input.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. **Initialization**: The loop starts with `t` iterations specified.
2. **Iteration Process**:
   - For each iteration, the loop reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads `m` lines of input to form the `friendships` list.
   - The function `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)` is called, and its return value is stored in `result`.
   - The result is printed.
3. **Completion**: After all `t` iterations are completed, the loop ends.

Since the loop processes each set of inputs independently and prints the result immediately after processing, the final output state will reflect the last iteration's computation. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` will hold the values from the last iteration, and `result` will hold the final result computed by `func_1` for that last iteration.

Thus, the output state after all iterations will be:

Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input in the last iteration, `m` is the second integer read from the input in the last iteration, `k` is the third integer read from the input in the last iteration, `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists where each sublist contains three integers read from the input in the last iteration, `t` is the total number of iterations (unchanged), and `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)` for the last iteration.**

In simpler terms, the output state reflects the state after the last test case has been processed and its result printed.
