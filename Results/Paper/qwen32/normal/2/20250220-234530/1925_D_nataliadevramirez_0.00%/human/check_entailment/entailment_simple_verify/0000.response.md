### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several critical issues with the provided program. Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the annotated version and the problem description to confirm the accuracy of the original assessment.

#### Key Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:

1. **Friendship Value Update**: The program does not dynamically update the friendship values based on the selections made during the k excursions. Instead, it uses a fixed formula `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2)`, which assumes that the friendship value remains constant throughout all excursions. This is incorrect because the friendship value increases by 1 each time the same pair is chosen.

2. **Probability Consideration**: The program does not consider the probability of selecting each pair in each excursion. Since the selection is random and independent, the expected value calculation should take into account the probability of selecting each pair in each excursion.

3. **Modulo Operation**: While the modulo operation is applied, the program does not handle the division operation correctly in the context of modular arithmetic. The expected value is a fraction, and converting this fraction to an integer under modulo requires careful handling of modular inverses.

#### Detailed Analysis Using Annotations:

- **State Before Function Call**: The annotations correctly describe the state of the variables before the function calls. For `func_1`, the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` are correctly defined. For `func_2`, the input parsing and state management are also correctly described.

- **Inside `func_1`**:
  - The loop iterates over each friendship pair and calculates the contribution to the result using the formula `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`. This formula assumes that the friendship value remains constant throughout all excursions, which is incorrect.
  - The result is accumulated and returned modulo `MOD`.

- **Inside `func_2`**:
  - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case independently.
  - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of friendships.
  - It calls `func_1` to compute the result for the current test case and prints the result.

#### Counterexample:

The original assessment provides a counterexample with `n = 2`, `m = 1`, `k = 2`, and a single friendship pair `(1, 2)` with an initial friendship value of `f = 1`. Let's verify this:

- **Expected Calculation**:
  - In the first excursion, the friendship value is 1.
  - In the second excursion, the friendship value is 2 (since it increased by 1 in the first excursion).
  - Total expected sum = 1 + 2 = 3.

- **Program Calculation**:
  - The program calculates `result = 1 * (2 * (2 + 1) // 2) % MOD = 1 * 3 % MOD = 3`.

While the program gives the correct result for this specific example, it does not generalize correctly. For larger values of `k` and more complex scenarios, the program will not account for the increasing friendship values.

#### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions due to the issues mentioned above. Therefore, the program is incorrect for all potential cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
