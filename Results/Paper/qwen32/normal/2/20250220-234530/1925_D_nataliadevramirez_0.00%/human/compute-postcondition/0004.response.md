To determine the output state, we need to understand what the function `func_1` does. Since the implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we'll assume it performs some computation using the inputs `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`, and returns a result.

Given the initial state and the call to `func_1`, the only variable that changes is `result`, which is assigned the return value of `func_1`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists where each sublist contains three integers read from the input, `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**.

In simpler terms, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `friendships`, and `t` remain unchanged, while `result` now holds whatever value `func_1` returns when called with these inputs.
