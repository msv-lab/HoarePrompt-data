Postcondition: **`heap` contains the last `k` elements of the original `combined` list (or all elements if `combined` had fewer than `k` elements); `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` is the initial value minus the number of iterations (which is `0` if all iterations were completed); `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`; otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged; `current_profit` retains its value; `test_cases` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration in both cases; `combined` is an empty list; `item` is `some_value`. Additionally, the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is less than 0.**
