The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use. This means that the loop's continuation depends solely on the `test_cases` variable.

Given that `test_cases` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, and since the loop decrements `test_cases` by 1 in each iteration (implied by the loop structure), we need to adjust `test_cases` accordingly.

At the end of the previous iteration, `test_cases` was greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must still be greater than 0 after the decrement.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `test_cases` should be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`heap` contains the last `k` processed items, `combined` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is the maximum profit achieved, `current_profit` is the profit after processing all items, `test_cases` is greater than 0 and one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration**
