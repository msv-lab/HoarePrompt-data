Output State: **`heap` contains the last `k` elements of `combined` (excluding the smallest element and the popped item) plus `item`, excluding the smallest element among them; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before `item` was added; `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `test_cases`, `remaining_items`, `max_profit`, and `current_profit` remain unchanged; `current_profit` is decreased by the value of `removed_item[0]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `current_profit` is reduced by the first element of `removed_item`. All other variables retain their original values and conditions.
