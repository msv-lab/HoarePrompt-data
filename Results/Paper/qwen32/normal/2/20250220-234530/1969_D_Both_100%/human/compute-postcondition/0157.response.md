To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the condition specified in the loop head. The loop condition is `while combined:`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `combined` is not empty.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `heap` contains the last `k` elements that were in `combined` (or all elements of `combined` if `combined` had fewer than `k` elements).
- `combined` may or may not be empty.
- `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `test_cases`, `item`, `remaining_items` remain unchanged.
- If `combined` is not empty, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`.
- If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `combined` must not be empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `combined` contains at least one element.

### Adjusted State:
State: **`heap` contains the last `k` elements that were in `combined` (or all elements of `combined` if `combined` had fewer than `k` elements); `combined` is not empty; `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `test_cases`, `item`, `remaining_items` remain unchanged; if `combined` is not empty, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`; if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`.**
