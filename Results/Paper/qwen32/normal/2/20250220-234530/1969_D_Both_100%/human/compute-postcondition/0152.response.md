Output State: **heap contains the last `k` elements that were in `combined` (or all elements of `combined` if `combined` had fewer than `k` elements); `combined` is not empty; `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `test_cases`, `item`, `max_profit`, and `remaining_items` remain unchanged; `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`.**

Natural Language Explanation: After executing the code, the variable `current_profit` is updated to the value returned by the function `func_3` when called with `combined` and `heap` as arguments. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
