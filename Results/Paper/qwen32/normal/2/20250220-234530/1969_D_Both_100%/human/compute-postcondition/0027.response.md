The code assigns the value of `current_profit` to `max_profit`. This means that `max_profit` now holds the same value as `current_profit`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` contains the last `k` tuples from the original `combined` list or all tuples if `combined` had fewer than `k` tuples; `combined` may or may not be empty; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`; `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` remains 0; `test_cases` must be greater than 0.**
