Postcondition: **`heap` contains the last element that was in `combined` plus any previous elements it had; `combined` has one less element than before if it was not empty; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` is greater than 0; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is the list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, specifically `neg_prices = [(-price) for price in prices]`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `item` is the last element that was popped from `combined` during the last iteration if `combined` was not empty; `current_profit` is 0; `max_profit` is 0; `remaining_items` is an empty list. If `combined` was empty, none of these changes occur.**
