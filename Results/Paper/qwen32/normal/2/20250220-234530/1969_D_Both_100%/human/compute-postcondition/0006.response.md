The code snippet creates a new list `neg_prices` by taking each element from the `prices` list, negating it, and storing it in `neg_prices`. This means that if `prices` contained `[10, 20, 30]`, `neg_prices` would now contain `[-10, -20, -30]`.

Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of integers representing the bonuses Bob pays for items, `max_profit` is an integer representing the maximum profit Alice can achieve, `current_profit` is an integer representing the current profit Alice has, `combined` is a list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` paired together, and the `combined` list is sorted based on the bonus values; `test_cases` must be greater than 0.**
