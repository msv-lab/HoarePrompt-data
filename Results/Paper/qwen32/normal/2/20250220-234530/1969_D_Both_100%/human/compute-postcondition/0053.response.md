The only variable in the loop head is `combined`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `combined`. If `combined` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `combined` is not empty but contains one less element than before. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `combined` must still contain at least one element.

No other states need to be adjusted as per the requirement to only change the objects in the loop head.

State: **`heap` contains `item` instead of the smallest element it previously contained; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before `item` was pushed; if `removed_item` is truthy, `current_profit` is decreased by the first element of `removed_item` twice; `combined` is not empty; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice (each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`); `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged; `test_cases` must be greater than 0; `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined` before the pop operation; if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is decreased by `item[1]`; otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by the first element of `item`.**
