Output State: **`heap` contains all the original elements except the smallest one, plus `item`, minus the smallest element; `removed_item` holds the smallest element that was just popped from the heap; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` is the initial value minus the number of iterations; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `combined` is not empty (unless it had only one element, in which case it is now empty); `item` is the last element that was popped from `combined`; `current_profit` is reduced by the first element of `removed_item`. If `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is further reduced by `item[1]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`.**

In simpler terms, the `current_profit` has been decreased by the first element of `removed_item`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
