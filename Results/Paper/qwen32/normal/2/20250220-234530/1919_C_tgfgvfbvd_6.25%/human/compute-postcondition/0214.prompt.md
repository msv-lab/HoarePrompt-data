Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is `l[0]`, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its predecessor or 0 if no such element exists, `c` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `l` is the list of integers read from input, and `y` is the index of the first element that is greater than its predecessor or `n - 1` if no such element exists.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
        if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
        c += 1
    elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
        if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    elif a >= l[x]:
        a = l[x]
    else:
        b = l[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is either `l[0]` or `l[x]`, `b` is either the first element in `l` that is greater than its predecessor, `l[x]` if `l[x]` is greater than the previous `b`, or 0 if no such element exists. `c` is 1 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`; otherwise, `c` is 0. `n` is the input integer, `l` is the list of integers read from input, and `y` is an index such that `y < n - 1`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a` is greater than or equal to `l[x] - b`; otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`; otherwise, `a` remains `l[0]` and `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a >= l[x]`, and `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x]` is greater than the previous `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is either `l[0]` or `l[x]` if `l[x] > a and l[x] > b`, otherwise `a` is either `l[0]` or `l[x+1]`. `b` is either the first element in `l` that is greater than its predecessor, `l[x]` if `l[x]` is greater than the previous `b`, or 0 if no such element exists, and it is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b` and `a - l[x] > b - l[x]`. `c` is 2 if `l[x] > a and l[x] > b`, otherwise `c` is 1 if `l[x+1]` is greater than both `a` and `b`; otherwise, `c` is 0. `n` is the input integer, `l` is the list of integers read from input, `y` is an index such that `y < n - 1`, and `x` is `x + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is either `l[0]` or `l[x]` if `l[x] > a and l[x] > b`, otherwise `a` is either `l[0]` or `l[x+1]`. `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a < l[x] - b` or if `l[x]` is greater than the previous `b` or if `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b` and `a - l[x] > b - l[x]`. `c` is 3 if `l[x] > a and l[x] > b`, otherwise `c` is 2 if `l[x+1]` is greater than both `a` and `b`; otherwise, `c` is 1 if `l[x] > a and l[x] > b` or `l[x+1]` is greater than both `a` and `b`; otherwise, `c` is 0. `n` is the input integer, `l` is the list of integers read from input, `y` is an index such that `y < n - 1`, and `x` is `x + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
