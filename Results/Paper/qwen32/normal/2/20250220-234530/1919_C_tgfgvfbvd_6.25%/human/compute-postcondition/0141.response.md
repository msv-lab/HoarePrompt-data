Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is less than `n-1`, `x` is `y + 3`, `a` and `b` are updated based on the comparison with `l[x]`, and `c` is incremented by 1 if `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, `c` remains unchanged. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, `a` is set to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`; otherwise, `b` is set to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, `a` is set to `l[x]` if `a < l[x]`; otherwise, `a` remains unchanged, and `b` is set to `l[x]` if `a < l[x]`; otherwise, `b` remains unchanged.**
