Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze why:

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to split the array `a` into two subsequences `s` and `t` such that the sum of penalties `p(s) + p(t)` is minimized. The penalty `p(b)` for a subsequence `b` is defined as the number of indices `i` where `b[i] < b[i+1]`.

### Issues in the Provided Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Penalty Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to maintain two variables `a` and `b` which seem to represent the last elements of subsequences `s` and `t`.
   - It tries to increment the penalty count `c` based on certain conditions, but these conditions do not accurately reflect the penalty calculation as per the problem description.
   
2. **Handling of Subsequences**:
   - The program does not actually create or manage subsequences `s` and `t`. Instead, it uses `a` and `b` to track the last elements of what could be subsequences, but this approach is flawed.
   - The program does not consider all possible splits of the array and does not ensure that the penalty is minimized.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider a simple counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 3 2 4 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- One optimal split could be `s = [1, 2, 5]` and `t = [3, 4]`.
- Penalty for `s`: `p(s) = 2` (since `1 < 2` and `2 < 5`).
- Penalty for `t`: `p(t) = 1` (since `3 < 4`).
- Total penalty: `p(s) + p(t) = 2 + 1 = 3`.

However, another optimal split could be `s = [1, 3, 4, 5]` and `t = [2]`.
- Penalty for `s`: `p(s) = 3` (since `1 < 3`, `3 < 4`, and `4 < 5`).
- Penalty for `t`: `p(t) = 0` (since `t` has only one element).
- Total penalty: `p(s) + p(t) = 3 + 0 = 3`.

But the minimum possible penalty is actually `2` with the split `s = [1, 2, 5]` and `t = [3, 4]`.

**Actual Output from Provided Program:**
The provided program would likely output `1` or some other incorrect value because it does not correctly handle the logic for splitting the array and calculating the penalties.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified and the counterexample provided, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is `False`.
