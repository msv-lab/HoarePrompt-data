Postcondition: **`a` is either `l[0]` or `l[x]`, `b` is either the first element in `l` that is greater than its predecessor, `l[x+1]` if `l[x+1]` is greater than the previous `b`, or `l[x]` if `a >= l[x]`, or 0 if no such element exists. `c` is 1 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`; otherwise, `c` is 0. `n` is the input integer, `l` is the list of integers read from input, `y` is an index such that `y < n - 1`, and `x` is `x + 1`.**
