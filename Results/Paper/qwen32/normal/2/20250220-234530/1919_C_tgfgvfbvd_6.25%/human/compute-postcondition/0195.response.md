Postcondition: **`a` is either `l[0]` or `l[x+1]`. If `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, then `b` remains the first element in `l` that is greater than its predecessor, `l[x+1]` if `l[x+1]` is greater than the previous `b`, or 0 if no such element exists. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`. `c` is 1 if `l[x+1]` is greater than both `a` and `b`; otherwise, `c` is 0. `n` is the input integer, `l` is the list of integers read from input, `y` is an index such that `y < n - 1`, and `x` is `x + 1`.**
