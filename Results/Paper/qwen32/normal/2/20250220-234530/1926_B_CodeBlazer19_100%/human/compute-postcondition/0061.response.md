To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer provided by user input, where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
2. `i` is initialized to 1.
3. `n` is another input integer.
4. `a` is explicitly set to not be 'TRIANGLE'.
5. `b` is determined based on the presence of more than one '1' in any string `s`. If such a string `s` exists, `b` is set to 'SQUARE'; otherwise, `b` is set to an empty string `''`.
6. `j` is set to `n - 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(b)` statement will output the value of `b`. According to the initial state, `b` is either 'SQUARE' or an empty string `''` depending on whether any string `s` contains more than one '1'.

However, the initial state does not specify any string `s`. Therefore, without knowing the content of `s`, we cannot definitively determine if `b` should be 'SQUARE' or `''`. 

Given this ambiguity, we can only describe `b` based on the condition provided.

### Conclusion:
The value of `b` is dependent on the presence of a string `s` that contains more than one '1'. Since no such string `s` is specified in the initial state, we cannot provide a specific value for `b`. Thus, we describe `b` based on the given condition.

Output: **b (where b is 'SQUARE' if any string s contains more than one '1', otherwise it is '')**
