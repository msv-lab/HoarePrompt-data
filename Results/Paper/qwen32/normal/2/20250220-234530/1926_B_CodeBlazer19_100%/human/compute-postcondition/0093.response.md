Postcondition: **t is the initial input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), i is 2, n is the initial input integer, a is 'TRIANGLE' if the last string s had exactly one '1' else 0, b is 'SQUARE' if any string s had more than one '1' else '', j is the initial input integer. Specifically, if the last string s had exactly one '1', then a is 'TRIANGLE'; otherwise, a is 0.**
