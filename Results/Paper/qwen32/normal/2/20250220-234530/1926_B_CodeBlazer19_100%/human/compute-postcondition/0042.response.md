The code snippet assigns the string `'SQUARE'` to the variable `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is 0, `b` is `'SQUARE'`, `j` is 0, `s` is a string provided by user input, and the string `s` contains more than one '1'.**
