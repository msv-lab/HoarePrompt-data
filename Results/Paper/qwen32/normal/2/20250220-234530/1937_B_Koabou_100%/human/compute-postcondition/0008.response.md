To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to carefully analyze the given loop and its behavior.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for _ in range(2):
    a.append(input())
```

This loop will iterate exactly 2 times because the range is set to 2. During each iteration, it appends a new input string to the list `a`.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 · 10^5.
- Two binary strings of length `n` are provided as input.
- `a` is initially an empty list.

### Iteration Breakdown:
1. **First Iteration (`_ = 0`)**:
   - The first binary string (of length `n`) is read from the input and appended to `a`.
   - Now, `a` contains one element: `[first_binary_string]`.

2. **Second Iteration (`_ = 1`)**:
   - The second binary string (of length `n`) is read from the input and appended to `a`.
   - Now, `a` contains two elements: `[first_binary_string, second_binary_string]`.

Since the loop runs exactly 2 times, there is no third iteration. Therefore, the final state of `a` will contain exactly the two binary strings provided as input.

### Final Output State:
- `n` remains the same integer between 2 and 2 · 10^5.
- The two binary strings of length `n` are stored in `a` as its two elements.
- The loop variable `_` will be 1 after the last iteration, but it is not relevant to the final state of `a`.

Thus, the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`a` is a list containing two binary strings of length `n`, and `_` is 1.**
