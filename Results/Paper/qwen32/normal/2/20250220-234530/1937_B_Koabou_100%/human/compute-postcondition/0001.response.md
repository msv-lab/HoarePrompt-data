The code snippet provided reads an integer `n` from the input. This integer represents the length of two binary strings that follow in each test case. The variable `a` remains unchanged as it is an empty list and no operations are performed on it in the given snippet.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), followed by two binary strings of length `n`, representing the top and bottom rows of a 2 × `n` grid. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `a` is an empty list. `n` is assigned the value of the first integer input.**
