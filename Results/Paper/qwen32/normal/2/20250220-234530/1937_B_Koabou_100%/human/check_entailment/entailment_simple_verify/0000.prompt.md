You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to correctly compute the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string for certain inputs.

Let's analyze the program with a specific test case:

### Test Case:
```
1
4
1101
1100
```

### Expected Output:
```
11000
1
```

### Actual Output from the Program:
```
11011
1
```

### Explanation of the Issue:
The program incorrectly constructs the string `s` and counts the number of paths `t`. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of why it fails:

1. **String Construction (`s`)**:
   - The program iterates through the columns and tries to find the point where switching rows would yield a lexicographically smaller string.
   - However, the logic for constructing the string `s` is flawed. In the given test case, the program incorrectly appends parts of the rows without ensuring the lexicographically smallest path is taken.
   
2. **Counting Paths (`t`)**:
   - The logic for counting the number of paths `t` is also flawed. The program attempts to count paths based on a substring match, but this approach does not correctly account for all possible paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.

### Another Test Case:
```
1
8
00100111
11101101
```

### Expected Output:
```
001001101
4
```

### Actual Output from the Program:
```
001001111
1
```

### Explanation of the Issue:
- The program again incorrectly constructs the string `s` and counts the number of paths `t`.
- The constructed string `s` is not the lexicographically smallest string, and the count of paths `t` is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all cases and fails to produce the expected results for certain inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
