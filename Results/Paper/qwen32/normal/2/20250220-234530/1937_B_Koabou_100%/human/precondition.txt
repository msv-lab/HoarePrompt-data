The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), representing the length of the grid. The next two lines contain binary strings of length n, representing the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
