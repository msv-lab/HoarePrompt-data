### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Logic Error**: The current implementation simply calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and returns it. This does not consider how to optimally split the array to minimize the total penalty. The optimal splitting strategy involves considering the cumulative sums and making splits at points where the cumulative sum is zero, as this minimizes the penalty for each segment.

2. **Counterexample**: The counterexample provided in the original assessment demonstrates the flaw in the program. For the input `+-++--+`, the program would return `abs(3 - 3) = 0`, which is incorrect. The correct minimum penalty can be achieved by splitting the array in a way that results in subarrays with minimal penalties, such as `([1, -1, 1], [-1, 1, -1])`, leading to a total penalty of 2.

3. **Annotated Code Review**: The annotations confirm that the program is only counting the number of '+' characters and then calculating the absolute difference between the length of the string and twice the count of '+' characters. This calculation does not align with the required logic for minimizing the penalty.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
