Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `expression`, which is a string of length `length` consisting of characters '+' and '-', and a parameter `length`, which is an integer such that 1 <= length <= 5000. The function returns the absolute value of the difference between `length` and twice the count of '-' characters in the `expression`.**
