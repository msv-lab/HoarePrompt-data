To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop processes each character in the `expression` string. The loop iterates over each character in the string `expression`, and if the character is '+', it increments the `count` variable by 1.

Given that the loop runs for the entire length of the string `expression`, the final value of `count` will be equal to the number of '+' characters in the string `expression`.

Let's summarize the final output state:

- The `expression` remains unchanged as a string of length `length` consisting of characters '+' and '-'.
- The `length` of the string remains the same.
- The `count` variable will be equal to the number of '+' characters in the `expression`.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **expression is a string of length length consisting of characters '+' and '-', length is an integer such that 1 <= length <= 5000, count is the number of '+' characters in expression.**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes executing, `count` will hold the total number of '+' characters found in the `expression` string.
