Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to minimize the total penalty when splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s` into non-empty subarrays. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The optimal strategy involves grouping consecutive elements in such a way that the sum of each subarray is zero, which results in a penalty of zero for that subarray.

### Provided Program Analysis

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the penalty for a given string `expression`. Here's how it works:

1. It counts the number of '+' characters in the string.
2. It calculates the number of '-' characters by subtracting the count of '+' from the total length of the string.
3. It returns the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-'.

This approach does not actually split the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty. Instead, it simply calculates the difference between the counts of '+' and '-', which does not guarantee an optimal solution.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's consider the third example from the problem statement:

- Input: `+-+-+-`
- Expected Output: `0`

According to the problem, the optimal split would be `([1,-1],[1,-1],[1,-1])`, resulting in a total penalty of `0`.

However, the provided program would calculate:
- Count of '+': 3
- Count of '-': 3
- Penalty: `abs(3 - 3) = 0`

While this happens to give the correct answer for this specific case, it is not a general solution. For instance, consider the string `--++++++-`:

- Input: `--++++++-`
- Expected Output: `4`

The optimal split would be `([-1,-1],[1,-1,1,-1,1,1])`, resulting in a total penalty of `4`.

However, the provided program would calculate:
- Count of '+': 6
- Count of '-': 2
- Penalty: `abs(6 - 2) = 4`

Again, this happens to give the correct answer for this specific case, but it is not because of the logic used. The logic is flawed because it does not actually perform any splitting to minimize the penalty.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem optimally. It only happens to give the correct answer for certain specific cases due to the nature of those cases, but it does not guarantee a correct solution for all possible inputs.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
