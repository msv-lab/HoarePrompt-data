The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as the loop counter. The loop will execute `m - 2` times, and since `m` is given as 5, the loop will execute 3 times (`5 - 2 = 3`). 

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, meaning the loop has already executed once. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is 5, `n` is an integer read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `idx1` is either `n - 2` or -1, `idx2` is not -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `val` is a list containing two tuples `[(a3, l3), (a3, l3)]`, `a3` is the first integer from the new input line, `l3` is a list of integers from the new input line excluding the first integer, `_` is 2**
