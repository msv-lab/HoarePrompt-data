The code assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`. No other variables are affected.

Given that `i` is `i_end + 2`, the new values of `idx1` and `idx2` will also be `i_end + 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is 5 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `m` remains 1, `n` is at least 2, `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is `i_end + 2`, `idx1` is `i_end + 2`, `idx2` is `i_end + 2`. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
