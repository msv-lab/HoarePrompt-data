Postcondition: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is 5, `t` is incremented by 9, `val` contains the next tuple `(a5, l5)`, `a1` and `a2` are unchanged, `l1` and `l2` are updated based on the indices of `a1` and `a2` in `l3` if `idx1 <= idx2`, `l11` and `l22` are unchanged, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` and `idx2` may have changed based on specific conditions. If `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
