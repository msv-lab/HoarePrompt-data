The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('no')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'no'` to the console. The initial state provides several details about the variables and conditions (`t`, `n`, `m`, `val`, `p1`, `p2`, and `l3`), but these do not affect the execution of this particular `print` statement because it is printing a hardcoded string.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
