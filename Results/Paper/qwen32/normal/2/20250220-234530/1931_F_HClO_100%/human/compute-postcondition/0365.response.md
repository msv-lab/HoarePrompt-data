The code appends a new tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Since `val` already includes the tuple `(a3, l3)`, after appending, `val` will contain two identical tuples.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` includes the tuple `(a3, l3)` twice.**
