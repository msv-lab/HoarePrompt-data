Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged, `t` is incremented by `m - 2` for each iteration, `val` is an empty list, `p1` and `p2` are updated based on the conditions inside the loop, `a1` and `a2` are unchanged, `l1` and `l2` are unchanged, `l11` and `l22` are unchanged, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is not -1, `i` is `n-2` if the loop completes all iterations.`**

In simple terms, the only change is that `idx1` is now set to `n - 2`. All other variables remain in their initial states.
