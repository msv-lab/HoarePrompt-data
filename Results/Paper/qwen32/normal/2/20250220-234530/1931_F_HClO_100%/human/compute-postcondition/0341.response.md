The given code snippet inserts `a1` into the list `l1` at the index specified by `idx2`. This operation affects the list `l1` by adding one element at the position `idx2`, shifting all subsequent elements one position to the right.

Given the initial state, the following changes occur:
- `l1` is modified by inserting `a1` at the position `idx2`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, `val`, `p1`, `p2`, `a1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`) remain unchanged unless their values are dependent on the modification of `l1`.

Since the problem specifies that `idx1` is greater than `idx2` and no other changes to `idx1` or `idx2` are made in the provided code snippet, these indices also remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged, `t` is incremented by `m - 2` for each iteration, `val` is an empty list, `p1` and `p2` are updated based on the conditions inside the loop, `a1` and `a2` are unchanged, `l1` has `a1` inserted at index `idx2`, `l2` is unchanged, `l11` and `l22` are unchanged, `i` is `n-2` if the loop completes all iterations, `idx1` is greater than `idx2` and remains unchanged, `idx2` remains unchanged.**
