The given Python code snippet appends a tuple containing `a3` and `l3` to the list `val`. Here's the output state after executing the code:

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged unless `m` is 2 in which case `t` remains unchanged, `val` is an empty list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, `p1` and `p2` are updated based on the conditions inside the loop, `a1` and `a2` are unchanged, `l1` and `l2` are unchanged except that `l1` may contain `a1` inserted at `idx2` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l2` contains `a2` inserted at `idx1`. `l11` and `l22` are unchanged, `i` is `n-2` if the loop completes all iterations, `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, and `l` is either `l1` or `l2` depending on the indices of `a1` and `a2` in `l3`.**

In simpler terms, the only change is that `val` now contains one tuple `(a3, l3)` instead of being an empty list. All other variables remain in their initial states or states determined by previous conditions.
