Postcondition: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `t` is incremented by `m - 2` compared to its value at the end of the previous iteration, `val` is an empty list if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `val` remains as `m - 2` tuples (a3, l3), `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` is set to `i`, `idx2` is set to `i`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `idx1` and `idx2` are already non-negative, indicating that `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1` have been true at some point, leading to `p1` being 1 and `p2` being 0, with `idx1` set to `i` and `idx2` set to -1, or vice versa, and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]` or `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1` or `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` unless `l1[i + p1] == a2`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `idx1` and `idx2` are less than 0, no changes are made to these variables other than potentially breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
