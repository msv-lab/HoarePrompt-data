Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `t` is incremented by `m - 2` compared to its value at the end of the previous iteration, `val` is an empty list if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `val` remains as `m - 2` tuples (a3, l3), `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `t` is incremented by `m - 2` compared to its value at the end of the previous iteration, `val` is an empty list if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `val` remains as `m - 2` tuples (a3, l3), `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` is set to `i`, `idx2` is set to `i`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `idx1` and `idx2` are already non-negative, indicating that `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1` have been true at some point, leading to `p1` being 1 and `p2` being 0, with `idx1` set to `i` and `idx2` set to -1, or vice versa, and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]` or `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1` or `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` unless `l1[i + p1] == a2`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `idx1` and `idx2` are less than 0, no changes are made to these variables other than potentially breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `t` is incremented by `m - 2` compared to its value at the end of the previous iteration, `val` is an empty list if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `val` remains as `m - 2` tuples (a3, l3), `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, the control does not enter the if block. If `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are set to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, `p1` is set to 1 and `p2` to 0 if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, otherwise `p1` is set to 0 and `p2` to 1, and `idx1` or `idx2` is set to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `t` is incremented by `m - 2` compared to its value at the end of the previous iteration, `val` is an empty list if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `val` remains as `m - 2` tuples (a3, l3), `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `idx1` and `idx2` are set to `i`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, the control does not enter the if block and continues with the next steps.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
