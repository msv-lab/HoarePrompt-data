Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `t` is incremented by `m - 2` compared to its value at the end of the previous iteration, `val` is an empty list if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `val` remains as `m - 2` tuples (a3, l3), `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is `i`, and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`. Additionally, `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]` or `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1` or `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `p2` has been updated to 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
