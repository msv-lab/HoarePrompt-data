Postcondition: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `t` is incremented by `m - 2` compared to its value at the end of the previous iteration, `val` is an empty list if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `val` remains as `m - 2` tuples (a3, l3), `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are set to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, `p1` is set to 1 and `p2` to 0 if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, otherwise `p1` is set to 0 and `p2` to 1, and `idx1` or `idx2` is set to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
