The code snippet assigns the value of `l1` to `l`. This means that `l` now holds the same list as `l1`.

Output State: **`t` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the first integer from the input, `m` remains the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding those equal to `a1`, `l` is a list containing the same elements as `l1`, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first integer from the latest input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, and the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`.**
