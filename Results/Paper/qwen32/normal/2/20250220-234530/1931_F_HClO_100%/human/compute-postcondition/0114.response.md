The code appends a new tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Given the initial state, `val` initially contains two tuples `[(a3, l3), (a3, l3)]`. After appending another tuple `(a3, l3)`, `val` will now contain three tuples.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is 5, `n` is an integer read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `idx1` is either `n - 2` or -1, `idx2` is not -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `val` is a list containing three tuples `[(a3, l3), (a3, l3), (a3, l3)]`, `a3` is the first integer from the new input line, `l3` is a list of integers from the new input line excluding the first integer, `_` is 2.**
