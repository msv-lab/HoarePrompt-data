Postcondition: **`t` is incremented by 1, `n` must be at least 2, `m` remains the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding those equal to `a1`. If `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative integers, indicating that `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1` for some index `i`, with `p1` and `p2` being either 0 or 1 such that `i + max(p1, p2) < n - 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `idx1` and `idx2` may not both be non-negative, and the loop or if statement continues.**
