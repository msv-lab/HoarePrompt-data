Postcondition: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged unless `m` is 2 in which case `t` remains unchanged, `val` is an empty list, `p1` and `p2` are updated based on the conditions inside the loop, `a1` and `a2` are unchanged, `l1` and `l2` are unchanged, `l11` and `l22` are unchanged, `i` is `n-2` if the loop completes all iterations, `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, and the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`.**
