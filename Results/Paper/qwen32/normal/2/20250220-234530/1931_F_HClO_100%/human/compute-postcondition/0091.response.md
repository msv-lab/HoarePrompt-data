Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's analyze what will be printed:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `m` is explicitly set to 2.
- `n` is an integer read from the input.
- `a1` is the first integer from a new input line.
- `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same new input line.
- `a2` is the first integer from another new input line.
- `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`.
- `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`. Note that `l2` is not mentioned in the initial state, but it seems like there might be a typo and it should be `l1` instead.
- `idx1` is either `n - 2` or -1.
- `idx2` is not -1.
- `p1` and `p2` are both initialized to 0.
- `val` is an empty list.
- Additional conditions update `idx1` and `idx2` to `n - 2` if `idx2` was -1 and `idx1` was not -1. Otherwise, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'yes'`. There are no variables or expressions involved in this print statement that depend on the initial state or any calculations performed prior to this statement. Therefore, the output will always be the literal string `'yes'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **yes**
