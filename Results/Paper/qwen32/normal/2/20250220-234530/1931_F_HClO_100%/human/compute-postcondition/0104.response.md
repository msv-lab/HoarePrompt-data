Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. If `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, then `m` is 5 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `m` remains 1, `n` is an integer read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at `idx2`, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `idx1` is either `n - 2` or -1, `idx2` is not -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and `val` is an empty list. If `idx1` is not greater than `idx2`, then `m` is 1 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `m` remains 0, `n` is an integer read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `idx1` is either `n - 2` or -1, `idx2` is not -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first integer from the new input line, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, and if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, then `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`. Otherwise, `l2` has `a2` inserted at the position `idx1` shifting all subsequent elements one position to the right, and `l` is a list that holds the same value as `l2`.**
