Postcondition: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is 2, `t` is incremented by `m - 2` for each iteration (which means `t` remains unchanged since `m - 2` is 0), `val` is an empty list, `p1` and `p2` are updated based on the conditions inside the loop, `a1` and `a2` are unchanged, `l1` and `l2` are unchanged, `l11` and `l22` are unchanged, `i` is `n-2` if the loop completes all iterations. If `idx2` is `-1` and `idx1` is not `-1`, then `idx2` is set to `n - 2`. Otherwise, `idx2` remains unchanged. If `idx1` is `-1` and `idx2` is not `-1`, then `idx1` is set to `n - 2`. Otherwise, `idx1` remains `-1`. Additionally, `idx1` is not less than `idx2`. Furthermore, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`.**
