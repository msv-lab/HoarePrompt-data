Postcondition: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `t` is incremented by 1 compared to its value at the end of the previous iteration, `val` contains `m - 2` tuples (a3, l3), `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and the loop prints 'yes'. If `m` is not equal to 1, the behavior remains unchanged as specified in the precondition.**
