To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop terminates and how the variables evolve throughout the iterations.

### Loop Termination Conditions:
1. **Condition 1**: The loop iterates `n-1` times, but it can break early if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`.
2. **Condition 2**: The loop breaks if `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]` and `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, setting `idx1` and `idx2` to `i`.
3. **Condition 3**: The loop also breaks if both `idx1` and `idx2` become non-negative (indicating that `a2` and `a1` have been found in `l1` and `l2` respectively).

### Iteration Details:
- **Initialization**: `idx1` and `idx2` start at `-1`, and `p1` and `p2` start at `0`.
- **First Iteration**: Checks `l1[0]` against `l2[0]`. Adjusts `idx1` or `idx2` and `p1` or `p2` if necessary.
- **Subsequent Iterations**: Continue checking subsequent elements, adjusting indices and offsets as per the conditions.

### Final Output State:
The loop will continue until one of the termination conditions is met. Given the constraints and the nature of the loop, the final state will depend on whether the loop breaks early due to finding `a2` and `a1` or completes all iterations.

#### Case 1: Loop Breaks Early
If the loop breaks early due to finding `a2` and `a1` in `l1` and `l2` respectively, `idx1` and `idx2` will be set to the index where this condition is met. `p1` and `p2` will be set to `1` if `a2` or `a1` were found at those positions, otherwise they remain `0`.

#### Case 2: Loop Completes All Iterations
If the loop completes all iterations without finding `a2` and `a1` in the specified manner, `idx1` and `idx2` will remain `-1`, and `p1` and `p2` will remain `0` unless adjusted by the last iteration.

### Conclusion:
Given the provided information, the final state after all iterations will be determined by whether the loop broke early or completed all iterations. Since the exact input values are not provided, we assume the worst-case scenario where the loop completes all iterations without breaking early.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is 5 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `m` remains 1, `n` is an integer read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0.**
