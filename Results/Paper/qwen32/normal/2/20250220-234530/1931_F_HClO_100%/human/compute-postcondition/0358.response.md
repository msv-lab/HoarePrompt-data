Postcondition: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged unless `m` was initially 2 and `idx1 <= idx2`, in which case `m` becomes `m - 1`. `t` is incremented by `m - 2` for each iteration. `val` is an empty list unless `idx1 <= idx2`, in which case `val` contains the tuple `(a3, l3)`. `p1` and `p2` are updated based on the conditions inside the loop. `a1` and `a2` are unchanged. `l1` and `l2` are unchanged unless `idx1 <= idx2` and the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, in which case `a1` is inserted at `idx2` in `l1`; otherwise, `a2` is inserted at `idx1` in `l2`. `l11` and `l22` are unchanged. `i` is `n-2` if the loop completes all iterations. `idx1` is not less than `idx2`. If `idx1 > idx2`, both `idx1` and `idx2` remain unchanged. If `idx1 <= idx2`, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`. `a3` is the first integer from the input if `idx1 <= idx2`. `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input if `idx1 <= idx2`. `l` is either `l1` or `l2` depending on the indices of `a1` and `a2` in `l3` if `idx1 <= idx2`; otherwise, `l` is equal to `l1`.**
