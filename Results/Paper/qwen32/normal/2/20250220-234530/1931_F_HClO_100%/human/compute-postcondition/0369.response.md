To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the given information about the loop's behavior and the provided output states after the first few iterations.

### Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs `m - 2` times. This means if `m` is 5, the loop will run 3 times, as per the provided output states.
2. **Variable Updates**:
   - `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
   - `m` remains unchanged unless it was initially 2 and `idx1 <= idx2`, but since `m` is 5, this condition does not apply.
   - `t` is incremented by `m - 2` for each iteration. Since `m` is 5, `t` is incremented by 3 for each iteration.
   - `val` appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` for each iteration.
   - `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged.
   - `l1` and `l2` are updated based on the indices of `a1` and `a2` in `l3` if `idx1 <= idx2`.
   - `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged.
   - `i` is set to `n - 2` after all iterations.
   - `idx1` and `idx2` may change based on specific conditions, but their exact values depend on the input data and the logic within the loop.

### Given Output States:
- After 1 iteration: `val` contains one tuple `(a3, l3)`.
- After 2 iterations: `val` contains two tuples `(a3, l3)`.
- After 3 iterations: `val` contains three tuples `(a3, l3)`.

### Final Output State:
Since `m` is 5, the loop runs 3 times, and we already know the state after 3 iterations. Therefore, no additional iterations occur, and the final state is the same as after 3 iterations.

### Calculation:
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `m` remains 5.
- `t` is incremented by 3 for each iteration, so `t` is incremented by `3 * 3 = 9`.
- `val` contains three tuples `(a3, l3)`.
- `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged.
- `l1` and `l2` are updated based on the indices of `a1` and `a2` in `l3` if `idx1 <= idx2`.
- `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged.
- `i` is set to `n - 2`.
- `idx1` and `idx2` may change based on specific conditions, but without specific input data, we cannot determine their exact final values.

### Final Output State in the Required Format:
Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is 5, `t` is incremented by 9, `val` contains three tuples `(a3, l3)`, `a1` and `a2` are unchanged, `l1` and `l2` are updated based on the indices of `a1` and `a2` in `l3` if `idx1 <= idx2`, `l11` and `l22` are unchanged, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` and `idx2` may have changed based on specific conditions.**

In simple terms, the loop runs 3 times, appending three tuples to `val`, incrementing `t` by 9, and updating `l1` and `l2` if `idx1 <= idx2`. All other variables remain unchanged or are set according to the specified rules.
