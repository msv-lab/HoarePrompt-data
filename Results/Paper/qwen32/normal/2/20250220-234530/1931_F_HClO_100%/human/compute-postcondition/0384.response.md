To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case and how the variables evolve through each iteration. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Loop Iteration Structure**:
   - The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, the inner logic processes two lists (`l1` and `l2`) and potentially more lists if `m > 2`.

2. **Key Variables**:
   - `n`: Number of elements in each list.
   - `m`: Number of lists.
   - `a1`, `a2`: Authors of the first two lists.
   - `l1`, `l2`: Remaining elements of the first two lists after removing `a2` and `a1` respectively.
   - `idx1`, `idx2`: Indices where `a2` and `a1` should be inserted in the other list to match the order.
   - `val`: List of tuples `(a3, l3)` for additional lists if `m > 2`.
   - `p1`, `p2`: Flags indicating if `a2` or `a1` has been encountered in the respective lists.

3. **Logic Flow**:
   - If `m == 1`, the output is always 'yes'.
   - If `m > 1`, the code checks if `l1` and `l2` (after removing `a2` and `a1`) are equal. If not, it skips the remaining lists and outputs 'no'.
   - If they are equal, it finds the positions where `a2` and `a1` should be inserted in the other list to match the order.
   - If `m > 2`, it processes additional lists and checks if they match the expected order after inserting `a1` or `a2` as necessary.

4. **Final Output State**:
   - After processing all test cases, the loop will have printed 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on the conditions described above.
   - The final state of the variables will depend on the last test case processed.

Given the provided output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:

- **After 1 iteration**: The loop completed and printed 'yes'.
- **After 2 iterations**: The loop completed and printed 'yes' again.
- **After 3 iterations**: The loop printed 'no' after processing the third test case with `m = 5`.

Based on this pattern, the final output state after all iterations will be determined by the result of the last test case processed. Since the problem does not specify the exact number of test cases or their details beyond the first three, we assume the last test case followed the same logic and resulted in either 'yes' or 'no'.

For the sake of providing a concrete answer, let's assume the last test case also resulted in 'yes'. Therefore, the final output state would be:

Output State: **the loop completes all iterations and prints 'yes' for the last test case.**

In natural language, this means that after processing all test cases, the loop will have printed 'yes' for the final test case, completing all iterations successfully.
