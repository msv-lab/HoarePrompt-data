The provided code snippet consists of a single line `input()`, which reads input from the user but does not assign it to any variable. This means that the value entered by the user is discarded, and none of the existing variables (`t`, `n`, `m`) are modified.

Given the initial state, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, and `m` currently has the value 1, the output state remains unchanged except for the fact that an input operation was performed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `m` is 1.**
