t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Each test case in test_cases is a tuple containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and an integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ n), followed by k lists of n integers each. Each list represents the order of participants seen by a participant, with the first element of each list being the participant who took the screenshot. All a_{ij} in each list are distinct and satisfy 1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n. The sum of n · k across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
