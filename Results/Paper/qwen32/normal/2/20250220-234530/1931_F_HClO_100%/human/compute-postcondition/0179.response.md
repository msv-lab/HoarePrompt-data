Output State: **`t` is incremented by 1, `n` must be at least 3, `m` remains the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding those equal to `a1`, `i` is 2, `idx1` is 2, `p1` is 1. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

In natural language: The variable `p1` is now assigned the value 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
