The code inserts the value of `a2` into the list `l2` at the index specified by `idx1`. This operation changes the contents of `l2` by adding one element at the position `idx1`.

Given that `idx1` is either `n - 2` or `-1`, and `idx1` is less than `idx2`, the insertion of `a2` at `idx1` does not affect the position of `idx2` in the list (since `idx2` is not -1 and is greater than `idx1`). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is 5 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `m` remains 1, `n` is an integer read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `idx1` is either `n - 2` or -1, `idx2` is not -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `val` is an empty list, `l2` has `a2` inserted at index `idx1`.**
