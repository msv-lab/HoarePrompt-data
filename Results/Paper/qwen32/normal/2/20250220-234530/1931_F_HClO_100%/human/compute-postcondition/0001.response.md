In the given task, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop variable `_` is used as a throwaway variable since the loop body is omitted. Therefore, the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `_`, but since it's a throwaway variable, adjusting it doesn't affect the execution of the loop.

However, the state description includes other variables (`n`, `k`, `a_{ij}`) that are used within the loop body, even though they are not directly part of the loop head. Since we're instructed to only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we don't need to adjust these variables.

Given this, the only thing we need to ensure is that `t` is set to a value that allows the loop to execute at least once. Since `t` is already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), it is already in a state that allows the loop to execute.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the loop head variables for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
