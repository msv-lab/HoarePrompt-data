Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    s = input()
    a = set(s)
    if len(a) == 1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        b = ''.join(sorted(s))
        c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
        if b == s:
            print(c)
        else:
            print(b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the string input by the user, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the string `s`. If the length of `a` is 1, then no additional changes are made. If the length of `a` is not equal to 1, `b` is the string formed by sorting the characters of `s` in ascending order, and `c` is the string formed by sorting the characters of `s` in descending order. If `s` is already sorted in non-decreasing order, then `s` equals `b`; otherwise, `b` is not equal to `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the new string input by the user, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the string `s`, `i` is `i_end + 1`. If `a` contains exactly one unique character, the conditions remain as specified in the if part. Otherwise, `b` is the sorted string of `s`, and `c` is the sorted string of `s` in reverse order.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the new string input by the user, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the new string `s`, and `i` is `i_end + 2`. If `a` contains exactly one unique character, the conditions remain as specified in the if part. Otherwise, `b` is the sorted string of the original string `s`, and `c` is the sorted string of `s` in reverse order. If `b` equals `s`, the condition holds as specified in the if part; otherwise, the condition holds as specified in the else part.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
