The code snippet assigns the variable `b` the value of the sorted string `s`. This means that the characters in `s` are rearranged in ascending order.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `s`, `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged except for `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the new string input by the user, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the new string `s`, `i` is `i_end + 2`, `b` is the sorted string of the original string `s`.**
