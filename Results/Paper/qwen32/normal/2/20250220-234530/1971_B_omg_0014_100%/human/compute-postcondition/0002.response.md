The code snippet `s = input()` assigns the value of the user input to the variable `s`. This means the original value of `s` (which was a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters) is replaced by whatever the user inputs. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the string input by the user, `n` must be greater than 0.**
