The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. This means that `n` will hold the integer value of whatever is input by the user. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and `s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10. Since `n` is newly introduced and not dependent on the previous values of `t` or `s`, those remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `n` is an input integer.**
