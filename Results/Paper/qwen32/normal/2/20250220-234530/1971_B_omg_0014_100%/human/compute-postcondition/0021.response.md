The code sorts the characters of the string `s` and assigns the sorted string to `b`. The values of `t`, `s`, `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the new string input by the user, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the string `s`, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `b` is the sorted string of `s`.**
