The code snippet `s[i] = '-1'` modifies the element at index `i` in the list `s` to the string `'-1'`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `s[i]` was initially `'1'`, and now it is `'-1'`. The other variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing the 30-bit binary representation of `x` (with the first bit changed to '1' if `flag` is 1 and `s[i]` was '0'), `flag` is 0, `length` is 30, `nalla` is incremented by 1, `i` is 0, `s[i]` is '-1', and `s[i]` does not equal `s[i + 1]`.**
