Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing the 30-bit binary representation of `x` where the 30th element is '0'. If `s[6]` was '-1' and `s[5]` was '1', then the 6th element of `s` is now '0'. `flag` is not 0, and `length` is 31, `i` is 6. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.**
