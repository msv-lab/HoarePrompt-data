Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing the 30-bit binary representation of `x`. If `flag` is 1 and the 30th element of `s` is '0', then the 30th element of `s` is set to '1'. Otherwise, if `flag` is not 0, the 30th bit of `s` is set to '0' and an additional '1' is appended, making `length` 31. If `flag` is 0, `s` remains unchanged with `length` 30. `flag` is not modified if it was not 0 initially, and `nalla` is incremented by 1 in all cases.**
