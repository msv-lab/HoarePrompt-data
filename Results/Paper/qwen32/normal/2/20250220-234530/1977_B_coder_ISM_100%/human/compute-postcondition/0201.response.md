Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 32 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `s` is a list of 30 characters ('1' or '0'), `flag` is either 1 or 0, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 32, `i` is 1. If `flag` is 1 and `s[i]` is '0', then `flag` is set to 0 and `s[i]` is '1'. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
