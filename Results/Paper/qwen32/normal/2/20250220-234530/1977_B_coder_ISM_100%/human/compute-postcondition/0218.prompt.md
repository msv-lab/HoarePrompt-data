Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 32 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `s` is a list of 30 characters ('1' or '0') representing the binary representation of `x` from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB), `flag` is 0, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 32.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 32 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `s` is a list of 30 characters ('1' or '0') representing the binary representation of `x` from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB). If `flag` was initially 0 and `s[0]` was '1' and `s[1]` was '1', then `s[0]` is now '-1', `flag` is 1, `s[0]` is '-1', and `s[1]` is '1'. Otherwise, if `flag` was 1, then `s[0]` is now '0'. `flag` is either 1 (with `s[0]` set to '0') or 0 (and `flag` remains 0). `length` is 30, `nalla` is 32, and `i` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 32 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `s` is a list of 30 characters ('1' or '0'), `flag` is either 1 or 0, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 32, `i` is 1. If `flag` was 1 and `s[i]` was '0', then `flag` is now 0 and `s[i]` is '1'. If `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` is '1' and `s[i]` equals `s[i + 1]`, then no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 32 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `s` is a list of 30 characters ('1' or '0'), `flag` is either 1 or 0, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 32, `i` is 2. If `flag` was 1 and `s[2]` was '0', then `s[2]` is now '1' and `flag` is now 0. If `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` is '1' and `s[i]` equals `s[i + 1]`, then `s` and `flag` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `s` and `flag` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
