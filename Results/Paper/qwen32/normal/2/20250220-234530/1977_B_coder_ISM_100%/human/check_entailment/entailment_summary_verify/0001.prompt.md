You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

    24
    
    15
    
    27

Output

    1

    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5

    6
    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for nalla in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        s = []
        length = 30
        for i in range(30):
            if x & pow(2, i):
                s.append('1')
            else:
                s.append('0')
        flag = 0
        for i in range(0, 29):
            if flag and s[i] == '0':
                s[i] = '1'
                flag = 0
            if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and (s[i] == '1'):
                s[i] = '-1'
                flag = 1
            elif flag == 1:
                s[i] = '0'
            else:
                pass
        if flag and s[29] == '0':
            s[29] = '1'
        elif flag:
            s[29] = '0'
            s.append('1')
            length += 1
        for i in range(1, length):
            if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
                s[i] = '0'
                s[i - 1] = '-1'
        print(length)
        print(*s)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer `x` and processes its binary representation. It modifies the binary representation according to specific rules and then prints the length of the modified binary string followed by the modified binary string itself.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find an array `a` of integers where each element is either 1, 0, or -1, such that:
- The sum of the array elements multiplied by powers of 2 equals the given integer `x`.
- No two consecutive elements in the array are non-zero.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - It initializes an empty list `s` to store the binary representation of `x` in terms of 1s and 0s.
   - It iterates over the range 0 to 29 (since `x < 2^30`), checking if the `i`th bit of `x` is set using bitwise AND (`x & pow(2, i)`). If the bit is set, it appends '1' to `s`; otherwise, it appends '0'.

3. **Adjusting the Array:**
   - It uses a flag to ensure no two consecutive elements are non-zero.
   - If two consecutive elements are '1', it changes the first '1' to '-1' and sets the flag.
   - If the flag is set and the current element is '0', it changes the '0' to '1' and resets the flag.
   - If the flag is still set after the loop, it adjusts the last element or appends a new '1' to the array.

4. **Final Adjustments:**
   - It ensures that no two consecutive elements are '1' by swapping '-1' with '1' if necessary.

5. **Output:**
   - It prints the length of the array and the array itself.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Handling of the Last Element:**
   - The logic for handling the last element when the flag is set is incorrect. Specifically, appending '1' directly without ensuring the array constraints might violate the rules.
   
2. **Conversion from String to Integer:**
   - The array `s` contains string values ('1', '0', '-1'). When printing, it should be converted to integers.

3. **Length Calculation:**
   - The length calculation might be incorrect due to the way elements are appended or modified.

### Correctness Evaluation:

Given the above issues, especially the potential violation of the constraints related to consecutive non-zero elements and the incorrect handling of the last element, the program is likely incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
