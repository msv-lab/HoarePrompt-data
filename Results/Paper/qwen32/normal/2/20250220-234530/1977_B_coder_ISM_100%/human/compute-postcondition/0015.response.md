The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range limit `30`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `x` is an input integer
- `s` is a list containing either the string `'1'` or the string `'0'` depending on whether the `i`-th bit of `x` is set or not, with an additional `'1'` appended if the `i`-th bit is set, or an additional `'0'` appended if the `i`-th bit is not set
- `length` is 30
- `i` is `i + 1`

To proceed to the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. The range limit `30` remains unchanged.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing either the string `'1'` or the string `'0'` depending on whether the `i`-th bit of `x` is set or not, with an additional `'1'` appended if the `i`-th bit is set, or an additional `'0'` appended if the `i`-th bit is not set, `length` is 30, `i` is `i + 2`**
