Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 32 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `flag` is not 0, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 32, `i` is 30, and `s` is a list that contains either `'1'` or `'0'` depending on whether the `i`-th bit of `x` is set or not, with an additional `'1'` appended if the `i`-th bit of `x` is set, otherwise an additional `'0'` is appended.**
