Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 32 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `s` is a list of characters ('1', '0', or '-1'). If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '1', `s` remains a list of 30 characters, `flag` remains 1, `length` is 30, and `nalla` is 32. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', `s` becomes a list of 31 characters with `s[29]` being '0' and `s[30]` being '1', `flag` remains 1, `length` is 31, and `nalla` is 32. If `flag` is 0, `s` remains a list of 30 characters, `flag` remains 0, `length` is 30, and `nalla` is 32.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 32 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `s` is a list of characters, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `length` is at least 2, and `nalla` is 32. If `s[i]` was '-1' and `s[i - 1]` was '1', then `s[i]` is now '0' and `s[i - 1]` is now '-1'. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 32 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `s` is a list of characters, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `length` is at least 2, and `nalla` is 32. `i` is `i + 1`. If `s[i] == '-1'` and `s[i - 1] == '1'`, then `s[i - 1]` is updated to `'-1'`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 32 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `s` is a list of characters, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `length` is at least 2, `nalla` is 32, `i` is `i + 1`. If `s[i] == '-1'` and `s[i - 1] == '1'`, then `s[i-1]` is set to `'-1'` and other elements of `s` are set to `'0'`. Otherwise, the list `s` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
