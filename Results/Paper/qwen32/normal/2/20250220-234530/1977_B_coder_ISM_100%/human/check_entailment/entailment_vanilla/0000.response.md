Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find an array `a` of integers where each element is either 1, 0, or -1, such that:
- The sum of the array elements multiplied by powers of 2 equals the given integer `x`.
- No two consecutive elements in the array are non-zero.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - It initializes an empty list `s` to store the binary representation of `x` in terms of 1s and 0s.
   - It iterates over the range 0 to 29 (since `x < 2^30`), checking if the `i`th bit of `x` is set using bitwise AND (`x & pow(2, i)`). If the bit is set, it appends '1' to `s`; otherwise, it appends '0'.

3. **Adjusting the Array:**
   - It uses a flag to ensure no two consecutive elements are non-zero.
   - If two consecutive elements are '1', it changes the first '1' to '-1' and sets the flag.
   - If the flag is set and the current element is '0', it changes the '0' to '1' and resets the flag.
   - If the flag is still set after the loop, it adjusts the last element or appends a new '1' to the array.

4. **Final Adjustments:**
   - It ensures that no two consecutive elements are '1' by swapping '-1' with '1' if necessary.

5. **Output:**
   - It prints the length of the array and the array itself.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Handling of the Last Element:**
   - The logic for handling the last element when the flag is set is incorrect. Specifically, appending '1' directly without ensuring the array constraints might violate the rules.
   
2. **Conversion from String to Integer:**
   - The array `s` contains string values ('1', '0', '-1'). When printing, it should be converted to integers.

3. **Length Calculation:**
   - The length calculation might be incorrect due to the way elements are appended or modified.

### Correctness Evaluation:

Given the above issues, especially the potential violation of the constraints related to consecutive non-zero elements and the incorrect handling of the last element, the program is likely incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
