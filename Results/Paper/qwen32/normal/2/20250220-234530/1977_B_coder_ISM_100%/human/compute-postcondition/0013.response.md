The code appends the string `'0'` to the list `s`. Therefore, the length of `s` increases by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing either the string `'1'` or the string `'0'` depending on whether the `i`-th bit of `x` is set or not, with an additional `'0'` appended to it, `length` is 30, `i` is `i + 1`**.
