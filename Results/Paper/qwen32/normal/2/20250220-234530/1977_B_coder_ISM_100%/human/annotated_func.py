    #State: The loop has processed `t` integers, each resulting in a modified binary representation `s` of length 30 or 31, and `nalla` is equal to `t`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer `x` and processes its binary representation. It modifies the binary representation according to specific rules and then prints the length of the modified binary string followed by the modified binary string itself.
