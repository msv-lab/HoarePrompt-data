Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of 30 strings where consecutive `'1'`s have been replaced with `'-1'` followed by `'0'`s, and any `'0'` encountered when `flag` is 1 has been flipped to `'1'`. `length` is 30, `flag` is 1, and `s[29]` is not `'0'`.**
