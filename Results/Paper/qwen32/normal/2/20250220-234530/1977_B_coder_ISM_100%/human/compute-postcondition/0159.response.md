Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing the 30-bit binary representation of `x` where the 30th element is '0', `flag` is not 0, `length` is 31, `i` is 7. If the 8th element (index 7) of `s` is '-1' and the 7th element (index 6) of `s` is '1', then the 8th element (index 7) of `s` is updated to '0'.**
