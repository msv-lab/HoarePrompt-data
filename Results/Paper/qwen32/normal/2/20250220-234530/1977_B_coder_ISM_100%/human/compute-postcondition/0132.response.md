Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `flag` is 1, `length` is 30, `nalla` is incremented by 1, `i` is 2, and `s[2]` is `'-1'`.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that the value of `flag` has been updated from 0 to 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
