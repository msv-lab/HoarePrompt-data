Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 32 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `s` is a list of characters ('1', '0', or '-1'). If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '1', `s` remains a list of 30 characters, `flag` remains 1, `length` is 30, and `nalla` is 32. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', `s` becomes a list of 31 characters with `s[29]` being '0' and `s[30]` being '1', `flag` remains 1, `length` is 31, and `nalla` is 32. If `flag` is 0, `s` remains a list of 30 characters, `flag` remains 0, `length` is 30, and `nalla` is 32.**
