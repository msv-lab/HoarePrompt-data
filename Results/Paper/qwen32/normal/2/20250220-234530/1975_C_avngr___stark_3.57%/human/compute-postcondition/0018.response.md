The code snippet provided only updates the value of `n` by reading a new integer input. The other variables (`t`, `a`, and `max`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0 (specifically, it is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration); `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `max` is the maximum value of the minimums of all consecutive pairs in the list `a`.**
