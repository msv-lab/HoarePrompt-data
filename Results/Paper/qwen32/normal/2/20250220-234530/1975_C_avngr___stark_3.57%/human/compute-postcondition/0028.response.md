The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. The value of `n` must remain greater than 1 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the current input, `i` is 3**.
