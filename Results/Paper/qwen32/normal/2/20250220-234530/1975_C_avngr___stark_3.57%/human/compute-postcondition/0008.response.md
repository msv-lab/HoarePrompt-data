Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If `min(a[i], a[i - 1])` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to the value of `min(a[i], a[i - 1])`. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.**
