The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. This means `n` is now an integer value obtained from user input. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer.**
