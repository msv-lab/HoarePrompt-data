You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), representing the length of the array a. This is followed by a line containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), representing the elements of the array a. The total number of elements across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        max = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if min(a[i], a[i - 1]) > max:
                max = min(a[i], a[i - 1])
        
        print(max)
        
    #State: `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the input integer for each test case, `a` is the list of integers read from the input for each test case, and `max` is the maximum value of the minimums of consecutive pairs in the list `a` for each test case. The loop has executed `t` times, and the final output consists of `t` lines, each containing the `max` value for the corresponding test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the length of an array, followed by `n` integers representing the elements of the array. For each test case, the function processes the array and returns some output based on the elements of the array. However, the specific output criteria are not detailed here.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
