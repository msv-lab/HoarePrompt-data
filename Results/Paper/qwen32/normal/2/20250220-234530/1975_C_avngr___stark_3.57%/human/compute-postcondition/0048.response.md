To determine what will be printed by the `print(max)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation involved:

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `t`: The number of test cases.
   - `n`: An input integer representing the number of elements in the list `a`.
   - `a`: A list of integers read from the input.
   - `max`: This variable holds the maximum value of the minimums of consecutive pairs in the list `a`.

2. **Computation:**
   - For each consecutive pair of integers in the list `a`, compute the minimum value of the pair.
   - Track the maximum value among these minimums.

3. **Output:**
   - The `print(max)` statement will output the maximum value found among the minimums of all consecutive pairs in the list `a`.

Given the initial state, we do not have specific values for `t`, `n`, or the contents of `a`. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of the described computation.

Output: **max (where max is the maximum value of the minimums of consecutive pairs in the list `a`)**
