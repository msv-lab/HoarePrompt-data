To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- The loop starts with `i = 1` and goes up to `n-1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, let's call it `i_prev`.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Identify the current value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `i_prev`.
2. **Increment `i`**: For the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.
3. **Check the condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

Given that `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration (as per the pattern in Example 1), `i` should now be 4 at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 4; `max` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.**

Note: The variable `max` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted based on the loop head. However, it is mentioned in the problem description, so we acknowledge its presence and state that it remains unchanged.
