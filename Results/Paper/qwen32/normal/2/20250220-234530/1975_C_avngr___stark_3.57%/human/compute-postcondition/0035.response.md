The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. This means that the previous value of `a` is overwritten with the new list of integers from the input.

Since the input operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `max`, or `_`, these variables retain their original values. The only change is that `a` now holds the new list of integers.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the list of integers read from the input, `max` is the maximum value among the minimums of consecutive pairs in the list `a`, and `_` is now the next iteration index (previously finished iteration index + 1).**
