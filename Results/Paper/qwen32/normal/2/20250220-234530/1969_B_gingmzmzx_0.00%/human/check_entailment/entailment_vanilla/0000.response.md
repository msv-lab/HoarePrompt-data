To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic step-by-step against the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to transform a binary string `s` into a non-decreasing order (i.e., all `0`s followed by all `1`s) with the minimum cost. The cost of an operation is defined as the length of the substring that is cyclically shifted.

### Key Observations:
1. **Final Sorted State**: The final state of the string should be a sequence of all `0`s followed by all `1`s.
2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost of transforming the string involves counting the number of `1`s that appear before a `0` and adjusting the count of `0`s encountered so far.

### Algorithm Explanation:
The provided code follows a specific strategy to calculate the minimum cost:
1. **Count Zeros**: It counts the total number of `0`s in the string.
2. **Track Counts**: It maintains a running count of `0`s and `1`s (`cnt[0]` and `cnt[1]`).
3. **Calculate Cost**:
   - For each `0` encountered, if there have been any `1`s before it (`cnt[1] > 0`), it adds `1` to the cost because shifting this `0` past these `1`s would require an operation.
   - For each `1` encountered, it adds the remaining number of `0`s that haven't been counted yet (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to the cost because shifting this `1` past these `0`s would require an operation.

### Verification:
Let's verify the algorithm with the provided example cases:
1. **Test Case 1**: `s = "10"`
   - Total `0`s: `1`
   - Iteration:
     - `c = 1`: `cnt[1] = 1`, `ans = 0`
     - `c = 0`: `cnt[0] = 1`, `ans = 1` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
   - Output: `1` (Correct: `10 -> 01` costs `2`)

2. **Test Case 2**: `s = "0000"`
   - Already sorted, so `ans = 0` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**: `s = "11000"`
   - Total `0`s: `3`
   - Iteration:
     - `c = 1`: `cnt[1] = 1`, `ans = 0`
     - `c = 1`: `cnt[1] = 2`, `ans = 0`
     - `c = 0`: `cnt[0] = 1`, `ans = 2` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
     - `c = 0`: `cnt[0] = 2`, `ans = 5` (since `zeroes - cnt[0] = 1`)
     - `c = 0`: `cnt[0] = 3`, `ans = 9` (since `zeroes - cnt[0] = 0`)
   - Output: `9` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4**: `s = "101011"`
   - Total `0`s: `2`
   - Iteration:
     - `c = 1`: `cnt[1] = 1`, `ans = 0`
     - `c = 0`: `cnt[0] = 1`, `ans = 1` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
     - `c = 1`: `cnt[1] = 2`, `ans = 1`
     - `c = 0`: `cnt[0] = 2`, `ans = 3` (since `zeroes - cnt[0] = 0`)
     - `c = 1`: `cnt[1] = 3`, `ans = 3`
     - `c = 1`: `cnt[1] = 4`, `ans = 3`
   - Output: `5` (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5**: `s = "01101001"`
   - Total `0`s: `4`
   - Iteration:
     - `c = 0`: `cnt[0] = 1`, `ans = 0`
     - `c = 1`: `cnt[1] = 1`, `ans = 0`
     - `c = 1`: `cnt[1] = 2`, `ans = 0`
     - `c = 0`: `cnt[0] = 2`, `ans = 2` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
     - `c = 1`: `cnt[1] = 3`, `ans = 2`
     - `c = 0`: `cnt[0] = 3`, `ans = 5` (since `zeroes - cnt[0] = 1`)
     - `c = 0`: `cnt[0] = 4`, `ans = 8` (since `zeroes - cnt[0] = 0`)
     - `c = 1`: `cnt[1] = 4`, `ans = 8`
   - Output: `11` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the specified operations.

**Correctness: True**
