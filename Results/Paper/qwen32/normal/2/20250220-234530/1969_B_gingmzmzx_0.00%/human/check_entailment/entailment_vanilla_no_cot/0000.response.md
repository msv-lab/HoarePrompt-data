Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using the allowed operations. The logic in the program does not properly account for the cost of performing cyclic shifts on substrings to achieve the desired sorted order.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the transitions between '1's and '0's in the string and calculate the cost of shifting substrings accordingly. The current implementation incorrectly counts the number of operations needed without considering the actual cost of those operations.

Here is a brief outline of a correct approach:

1. Traverse the string and identify segments of consecutive '1's and '0's.
2. Calculate the cost of converting the string to a form where all '1's come after all '0's by considering the transitions between these segments.
3. Sum up the costs of these transitions to get the minimum total cost.

The provided program does not follow this approach, hence it is incorrect.
