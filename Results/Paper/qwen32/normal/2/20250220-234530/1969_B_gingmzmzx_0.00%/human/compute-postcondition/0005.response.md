The given code snippet initializes a variable `ans` to 0. No other variables are modified. The initial conditions for `t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, and the length of `s` is 2 ≤ len(s) ≤ 2 · 10^5, `n` must be greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is [0, 0], `ans` is 0.**
