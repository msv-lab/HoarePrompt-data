Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, and the length of `s` is at least 2, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is either [1, 0] or [0, 1]. If `c` is 0, then `ans` is 1 if `cnt` was [1, 0] else 0. If `c` is not 0, then `ans` is `ans + (zeroes - cnt[0])`.**
