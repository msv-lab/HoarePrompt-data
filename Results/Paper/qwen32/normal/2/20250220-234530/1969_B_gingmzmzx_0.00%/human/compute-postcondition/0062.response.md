The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the value at the index `c` in the list `cnt` by 1. Given that `c` is the next element in the list `s`, and `cnt` is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]`, the value of `cnt[c]` will increase by 1.

Let's consider the two possible initial states for `cnt`:

1. If `cnt` is `[1, 0]` and `c` is `0`, then `cnt[0]` will be incremented from `1` to `2`, making `cnt` equal to `[2, 0]`.
2. If `cnt` is `[1, 0]` and `c` is `1`, then `cnt[1]` will be incremented from `0` to `1`, making `cnt` equal to `[1, 1]`.
3. If `cnt` is `[0, 1]` and `c` is `0`, then `cnt[0]` will be incremented from `0` to `1`, making `cnt` equal to `[1, 1]`.
4. If `cnt` is `[0, 1]` and `c` is `1`, then `cnt[1]` will be incremented from `1` to `2`, making `cnt` equal to `[0, 2]`.

The values of `t`, `s`, `n`, and `zeroes` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a new list of integers derived from the input and contains at least one element, `n` is `n + 1`, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the new list `s`, `cnt` is updated to `[2, 0]` if `cnt` was `[1, 0]` and `c` is `0`, or `[1, 1]` if `cnt` was `[1, 0]` and `c` is `1`, or `[1, 1]` if `cnt` was `[0, 1]` and `c` is `0`, or `[0, 2]` if `cnt` was `[0, 1]` and `c` is `1`, `c` is the next element in the list `s`.**
