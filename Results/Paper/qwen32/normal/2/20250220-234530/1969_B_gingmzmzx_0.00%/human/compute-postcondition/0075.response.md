Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a binary string `s`. It then calculates and prints the number of valid (0, 1) pairs in the string `s`, where a valid pair is defined as a '0' that appears before any '1'. This process is repeated for each of the `n` test cases.**
