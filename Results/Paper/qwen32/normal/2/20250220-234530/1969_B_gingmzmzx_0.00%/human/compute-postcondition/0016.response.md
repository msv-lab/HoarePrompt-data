The code snippet `ans += zeroes - cnt[0]` modifies the variable `ans` by adding the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]` to its current value.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, and the length of `s` is at least 2
- `n` is greater than 0
- `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`
- `cnt` is either [1, 0] or [0, 1] with `cnt[c]` incremented by 1, where `c` is the next element in the list `s`. If `c` is 0, then `cnt[0]` is incremented by 1. If `c` is 1, then `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1.

After executing the code snippet, the value of `ans` changes as follows:
- `ans` is updated to its current value plus (`zeroes - cnt[0]`).

The other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, and the length of `s` is at least 2, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is either [1, 0] or [0, 1] with `cnt[c]` incremented by 1, `ans` is updated to its current value plus (`zeroes - cnt[0]`).**
