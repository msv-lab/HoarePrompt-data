The code snippet swaps the values of `a` and `t`. Before the swap, `a` contains elements from the original `a` where the cumulative XOR of the `i`-th bits results in 0, and `t` is a list containing `ai` if `op` was 0 at any point. After the swap, `a` will contain the elements of `t`, and `t` will be reset to an empty list.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list containing `ai` if `op` was 0 at any point, `t` is [], `i` is 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is the cumulative XOR of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`, `ai` is the cumulative XOR of all elements in `a` if `op` never became 0; otherwise, it is the last non-zero value before `op` became 0.**
