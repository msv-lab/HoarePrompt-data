The code snippet `t.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`
- `a` contains at least one element
- `t` is an empty list
- `ans` is -1
- `i` is 1
- `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`
- `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`
- `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`
- `ai` is `val`
- `op` is 0

After executing `t.append(ai)`, the list `t` will contain one element, which is `ai`.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains at least one element, `t` is a list containing `ai`, `ans` is -1, `i` is 1, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is 0, `ai` is `val`.**
