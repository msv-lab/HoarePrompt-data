The given line of code modifies the variable `op`. The operation `op ^= val >> i & 1` performs an XOR assignment between `op` and the `i`-th bit of `val`.

Here's the breakdown of the operation:
- `val >> i & 1` extracts the `i`-th bit of `val`.
- `op ^= ...` updates `op` to be the result of `op XOR (i-th bit of val)`.

Since `op` is initially the `i`-th bit of `x` and `val` is the next element in `a`, the new value of `op` will be the result of XORing the `i`-th bit of `x` with the `i`-th bit of `val`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `op` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and is not 0.
- `val` is the next element in `a`.

After the operation, `op` will be updated to `op XOR (val >> i & 1)`.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()` and has at least one element, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` will iterate from 29 down to 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and is not 0, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a` and is even and non-zero. If `op` (the `i`-th bit of `x`) is 0, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, `val` is the next element in `a`, `op` is updated to `op XOR (val >> i & 1)`.**
