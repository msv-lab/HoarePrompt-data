The given code snippet appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`. According to the initial state, `ai` is equal to `val`.

Since `t` initially contains `[val]` if `op` is 0, or it remains an empty list otherwise, appending `ai` (which is `val`) to `t` means that `t` will now contain two elements, both of which are `val`.

Here's the updated state:

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()` and must have at least two elements, `t` is a list containing `[val, val]` if `op` is 0, otherwise `t` is a list containing `[val]`, `ans` is -1, `i` will iterate from 29 down to 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and currently is 0, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a` and currently is even, `op` is the `i`-th bit of `val`, `ai` is `val`, `val` is the second element in the list `a`.**
