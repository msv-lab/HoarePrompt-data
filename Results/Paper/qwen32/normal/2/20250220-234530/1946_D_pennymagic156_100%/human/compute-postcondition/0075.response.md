The given code modifies the variable `ai` by performing a bitwise XOR operation with `val`. Here's the updated state of the variables after the code execution:

- `ai` is now `ai ^ val`.
- All other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `ans`, `i`, `u`, `v`, `op`, `t`, `val`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains at least two elements, `ans` is -1, `i` is 1, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `ai` is `ai ^ val`, if `op` is 0, then `t` is a list containing `ai`; otherwise, `t` remains an empty list, `val` is the second element of `a`.**
