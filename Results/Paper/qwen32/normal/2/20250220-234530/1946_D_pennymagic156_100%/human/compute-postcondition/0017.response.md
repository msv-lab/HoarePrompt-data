Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()` and must have at least one element, `t` is a list containing `[val]`, `ans` is -1, `i` will iterate from 29 down to 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and currently is 0, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a` and currently is even, `op` is 0, and `ai` is `val`. The condition `(not op)` is true, meaning `op` is 0.**

Explanation: The only change in the state is that the list `t` now contains the element `val` because `t.append(ai)` was executed. All other variables retain their initial values.
