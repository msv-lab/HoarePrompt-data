The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `ai`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains at least one element, `t` is a list containing `ai`, `ans` is -1, `i` is 1, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is 0, `ai` is 0.**
