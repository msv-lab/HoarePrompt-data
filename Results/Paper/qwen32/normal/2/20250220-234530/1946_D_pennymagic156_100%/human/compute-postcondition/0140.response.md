Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` contains elements from the original `a` where the cumulative XOR of the `i`-th bits results in 0. `t` is an empty list. `i` is 0. `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and `u` is not equal to 0. `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`. If `u == v == 0`, the state remains unchanged.**
