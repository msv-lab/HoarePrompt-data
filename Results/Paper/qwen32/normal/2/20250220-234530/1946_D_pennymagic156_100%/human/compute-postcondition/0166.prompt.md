Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(29, -1, -1):
    u, v = x >> i & 1, sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])
    if u == v == 0:
        continue
    if u == 0:
        if v % 2:
            return ans
        else:
            op = ai = 0
            for val in a:
                op ^= val >> i & 1
                ai ^= val
                if not op:
                    t.append(ai)
                    ai = 0
            a, t = t, []
    elif v % 2:
        continue
    elif v:
        op = cnt = 0
        for val in a:
            op ^= val >> i & 1
            if not op:
                cnt += 1
        ans = max(ans, cnt)
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains elements from the original `a` where the cumulative XOR of the `i`-th bits results in 0, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` has completed its iterations from 29 down to 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and varies with each iteration, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a` and varies with each iteration, `op` and `ai` are determined by the XOR operations within the loop. If during any iteration `u` is not 0 and `v` is even and non-zero, `ans` is set to `cnt`, where `cnt` is the total number of times the total number of elements in `a` whose `i`-th bit is 1 is even across all bits. If `v` is 0, `ans` remains -1 and the loop breaks.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` contains elements from the original `a` where the cumulative XOR of the `i`-th bits results in 0. `t` is an empty list. `i` is 1. `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`. If `u` equals 0, `a` is a list containing the cumulative XOR of groups of elements where `op` became 0, and `op` is the cumulative XOR of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`. If `u` is not equal to 0, `v` (the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`) determines the state: if `v` is odd, `v % 2` is not equal to 0; if `v` is even and non-zero, `a` is a non-empty list, `ans` is `max(-1, cnt)`, and `op` is 0 or 1 depending on the last element processed, where `cnt` is the number of times `op` became 0 during the loop execution; if `v` is 0, `ans` remains -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` contains elements from the original `a` where the cumulative XOR of the `i`-th bits results in 0. `t` is an empty list. `i` is 0. `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`. If `u == 0`, the state remains unchanged. If `u != 0`, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`. If `v` is odd, the state remains unchanged. If `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times `op` became 0 during the loop, and `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `cnt`. If `v` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
