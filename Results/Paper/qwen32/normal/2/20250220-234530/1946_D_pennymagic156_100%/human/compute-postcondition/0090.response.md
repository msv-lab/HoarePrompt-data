Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains elements from the original `a` where the cumulative XOR of the `i`-th bits results in 0, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 1, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`, and `u` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `v` is even**
