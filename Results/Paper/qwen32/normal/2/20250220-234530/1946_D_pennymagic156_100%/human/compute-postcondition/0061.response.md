The given code snippet updates the values of `u` and `v` based on the current value of `i`. Here's the updated state:

- `u` is now the `i`-th bit of `x`.
- `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`.

The other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged unless further operations are performed on them.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains elements from the original `a` where the cumulative XOR of the `i`-th bits results in 0, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 1, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`.**
