You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

We need to find the maximum number `k` of non-overlapping segments in an array `a` such that:
- The segments cover the entire array from the first element to the last.
- The bitwise OR of the bitwise XORs of the elements within each segment is less than or equal to a given number `x`.

### Solution Explanation

The provided solution uses a bit manipulation approach to solve the problem. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Bitwise Operations**: The solution iterates over each bit position from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB) of `x`. This is done using a loop from 29 down to 0 (since `x < 2^30`).

2. **Bit Extraction**: For each bit position `i`, the solution extracts the `i-th` bit of `x` (`u`) and the count of elements in `a` that have their `i-th` bit set (`v`).

3. **Handling Different Cases**:
   - If both `u` and `v` are 0, it means the `i-th` bit of `x` is 0 and no element in `a` has this bit set. Hence, we skip to the next bit.
   - If `u` is 0 but `v` is odd, it means the `i-th` bit of `x` is 0, but there is an odd number of elements with this bit set. This makes it impossible to partition the array into valid segments, so the function returns `-1`.
   - If `u` is 0 and `v` is even, the solution attempts to partition the array such that the XOR of elements in each segment has its `i-th` bit unset. It does this by iterating through the array and maintaining a running XOR (`op`). When `op` becomes 0, it means a valid segment has been found, and the current segment's XOR (`ai`) is stored in a temporary list `t`.
   - If `u` is 1 and `v` is odd, it means the `i-th` bit of `x` is 1, but there is an odd number of elements with this bit set. This case is skipped because it doesn't affect the maximum number of segments.
   - If `u` is 1 and `v` is even, the solution counts how many segments can be formed such that the XOR of elements in each segment has its `i-th` bit unset. It updates the maximum number of segments found so far (`ans`).
   - If `u` is 1 and `v` is 0, it means the `i-th` bit of `x` is 1, but no element in `a` has this bit set. This case is skipped because it doesn't affect the maximum number of segments.

4. **Final Result**: After processing all bits, the function returns the maximum number of segments found (`ans`), or the length of the array `a` if no valid segments were found.

### Issues in the Provided Code

Upon closer inspection, the provided code has several issues:
- The code does not correctly handle the case where `u` is 1 and `v` is even. It should attempt to partition the array similarly to when `u` is 0 and `v` is even, but it only counts the number of segments without actually partitioning the array.
- The code does not correctly update the array `a` after partitioning. It should reset `a` to the segments found in `t` for further processing, but it instead resets `t` to an empty list.
- The code does not handle the case where no valid segments are found correctly. It should return `-1` in this case, but it returns the length of the array `a`.

### Conclusion

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
