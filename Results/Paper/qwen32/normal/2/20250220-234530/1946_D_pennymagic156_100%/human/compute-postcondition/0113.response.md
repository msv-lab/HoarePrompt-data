The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. The loop iterates from 29 down to 0, decrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `a` contains elements from the original `a` where the cumulative XOR of the `i`-th bits results in 0.
- `t` is an empty list.
- `i` is 1.
- `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`.
- Depending on the value of `u` and other conditions, various states are determined.

Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be decremented by 1 from its current value of 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` contains elements from the original `a` where the cumulative XOR of the `i`-th bits results in 0. `t` is an empty list. `i` is 0. `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`.**
