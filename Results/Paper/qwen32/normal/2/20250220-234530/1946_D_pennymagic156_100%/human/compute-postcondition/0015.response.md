Given the code snippet `ai ^= val`, the operation being performed is a bitwise XOR between the current value of `ai` and `val`. Since the initial value of `ai` is specified as 0, the result of `ai ^= val` will simply be the value of `val` itself because XORing 0 with any number results in that number.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()` and must have at least one element, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` will iterate from 29 down to 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`, and `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`. The current value of `u` is 0, and `v` is even. `op` is 0, and `ai` is `val`.**

In simpler terms, the only change is that `ai` now holds the value of `val`. All other variables retain their initial values or states as described.
