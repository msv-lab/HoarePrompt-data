Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` will iterate from 29 down to 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`, and `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`. During the current iteration, `u` is not 0, and `v` is even and non-zero**
