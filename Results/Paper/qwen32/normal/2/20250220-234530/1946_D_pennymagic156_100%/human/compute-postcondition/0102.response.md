The only object in the loop head is the variable `val`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If there are more elements in `a`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `val` was the second element in `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `val` should be the next element in `a`, which would be the third element if it exists.

Let's assume `a` has at least three elements. Therefore, `val` should now be the third element in `a`.

State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a non-empty list, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 1, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and is not equal to 0, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a` and is even and non-zero, `val` is the third element in `a`, `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`. If `op` is 0, `cnt` is incremented by 1.**
