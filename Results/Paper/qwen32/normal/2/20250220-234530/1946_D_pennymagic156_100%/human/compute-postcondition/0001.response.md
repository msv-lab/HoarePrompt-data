The code snippet `a = func_1()` reassigns the variable `a` to the value returned by the function `func_1()`. This means the original list `a` (which was a list of `n` integers where each integer is less than \(2^{30}\)) is replaced by whatever `func_1()` returns.

Since the problem does not specify what `func_1()` returns, we can only say that `a` now holds the value returned by `func_1()`. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged as they are the values returned by `func_3()` and were not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`**.
