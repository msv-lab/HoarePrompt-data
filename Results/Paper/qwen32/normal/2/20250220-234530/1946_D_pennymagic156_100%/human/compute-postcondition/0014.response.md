To determine the new state after executing the given code snippet, we need to carefully analyze the operation being performed:

The line `op ^= val >> i & 1` performs a bitwise XOR operation on `op` with the `i`-th bit of `val`.

Given:
- `op` is initially 0.
- `val` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it seems to be related to `x` or an element of `a` since `u` and `v` are derived from `x` and elements of `a` respectively.
- `i` is the current iteration index, which ranges from 29 down to 0.
- `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`.
- `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`.
- The current value of `u` is 0, and `v` is even.

Since `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and `u` is currently 0, let's assume `val` here refers to `x` for the sake of this example (as no other `val` is mentioned). Therefore, `val >> i & 1` would give us the `i`-th bit of `x`, which is 0.

The operation `op ^= 0` means `op` remains unchanged because XOR with 0 does not change the value.

Thus, `op` remains 0.

Other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, `i`, `u`, `v`, `ai`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()` and must have at least one element, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` will iterate from 29 down to 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`, and `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`. The current value of `u` is 0, and `v` is even. `op` is 0, and `ai` is 0.**
