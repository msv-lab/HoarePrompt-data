The given code snippet modifies the value of `op` using the XOR operation with the `i`-th bit of `val`. Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains at least two elements, `ans` is -1, `i` is 1, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `ai` is 0 if `op` is 0, otherwise `ai` remains unchanged, `val` is the third element of `a`, and `t` is a list containing `ai` if `op` is 0; otherwise, `t` remains an empty list.**

In simpler terms, the value of `op` has been updated to the result of `op` XORed with the `i`-th bit of `val`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
