To determine the final state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses and what it accomplishes. The loop iterates over the `costs` list, summing up sublists of length `k` and appending these sums to the `total_costs` list. The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(costs) - k`, which means it will execute `len(costs) - k + 1` times.

Given the initial state and the provided output states after the first three iterations, we can infer the following:

- `n` remains unchanged as the number of rows.
- `m` remains unchanged as the number of columns.
- `k` remains unchanged as the number of bridges.
- `d` remains unchanged as the maximum distance between supports.
- `rows` remains unchanged as the 2D list of integers.
- `costs` remains unchanged as the list of costs derived from `rows`.
- `total_costs` accumulates the sums of `costs[i:i + k]` for all valid `i`.

After all iterations, `total_costs` will contain the sum of every possible sublist of `costs` of length `k`. The loop will have run `n - k + 1` times, and `total_costs` will have exactly `n - k + 1` elements.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of rows, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of columns, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of bridges, `d` is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports such that 1 <= k <= n and 3 <= m and 1 <= d <= m, `rows` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`, `costs` is a list of length `n` where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows`, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of `costs[i:i + k]` for all `i` from `0` to `n - k`.**

In simpler terms, `total_costs` will have `n - k + 1` elements, each being the sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.
