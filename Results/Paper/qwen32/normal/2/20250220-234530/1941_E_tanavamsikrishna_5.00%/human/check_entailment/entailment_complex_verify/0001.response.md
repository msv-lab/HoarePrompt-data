### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the annotations provided.

#### Problem Understanding:
- **Objective**: Minimize the total cost of installing supports for `k` bridges over consecutive rows.
- **Constraints**:
  - Supports must be placed in the first and last columns.
  - Distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
  - Cost of placing a support at `(i, j)` is `a[i][j] + 1`.

#### Analysis of the Given Program:

##### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: Calculate the minimum cost of placing supports in a single row.
- **Implementation**:
  - The first loop increments the first `d-1` elements by 1.
  - The second loop calculates the cost for each subsequent element based on the minimum cost of the previous `d` elements plus the current element's depth plus 1.
  
**Issue**:
- The function does not ensure that there is a support in the last column.
- The function does not explicitly enforce the placement of supports in the first and last columns.
- The function does not correctly handle the requirement that the distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.

##### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: Process multiple test cases, read input, and compute the minimum cost for `k` consecutive rows.
- **Implementation**:
  - Reads input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
  - Reads the grid of depths.
  - Uses `func_1` to calculate the cost for each row.
  - Computes the sum of costs for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
  - Prints the minimum of these sums.

**Issue**:
- Since `func_1` is incorrect, the costs calculated for each row are not accurate.
- Consequently, the sums of costs for `k` consecutive rows are also incorrect, leading to an incorrect final result.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations provide insights into the state of the program at key points but do not address the core issues with the cost calculation in `func_1`.
- The annotations confirm that the function modifies the row as described but do not validate the correctness of the cost calculation relative to the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in `func_1`, particularly the failure to ensure supports are placed in the first and last columns and the incorrect handling of the distance constraint, the program is not correct.

**Final: False**
