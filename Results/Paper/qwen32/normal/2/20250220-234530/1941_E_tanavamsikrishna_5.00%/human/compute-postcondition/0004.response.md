To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):`. Therefore, we need to consider the variables `i` and the expression `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

Let's break down the requirements:

1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The variable `i` is the loop counter and will be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.
   - No specific adjustment is needed for `i` itself, as it will be automatically set to 0 when the loop begins.

2. **Expression `len(costs) - (k - 1)`:**
   - This expression determines the upper limit of the loop (the number of iterations).
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be greater than 0.
   - Since `costs` is a list of length `n` (as per the problem statement), we need `n - (k - 1) > 0`.
   - Simplifying this inequality gives us `n > k - 1`.

Given the constraints:
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of rows.
- `k` is a positive integer representing the number of bridges such that `1 <= k <= n`.

From these constraints, we know that `n >= k`. Therefore, `n > k - 1` is always true given the provided constraints.

However, to ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `costs` is indeed a list of length `n` and that `n` and `k` satisfy the condition `n > k - 1`. Since `n > k - 1` is inherently satisfied by the problem constraints, the primary concern is ensuring `costs` is correctly initialized.

Thus, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure `costs` is a list of length `n` and `n` and `k` satisfy the given constraints.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of rows, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of columns, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of bridges, `d` is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports such that 1 <= k <= n and 3 <= m and 1 <= d <= m, `rows` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`, `costs` is a list of length `n` where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows`, `total_costs` is an empty list**.
