### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Breakdown:
- **Objective**: Minimize the total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive bridges across `n` rows and `m` columns of a river grid.
- **Constraints**:
  - Supports must be installed in the first and last columns (depth = 0).
  - Distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
  - Cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum cost for placing supports in a single row.
   - The first loop `for i in range(0, d - 1):` adds 1 to the first `d-1` elements. This part seems incorrect because it doesn't consider the optimal placement of supports.
   - The second loop `for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):` tries to find the minimum cost up to the previous `d` elements, but it doesn't ensure the supports are placed optimally or within the required distance `d`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Reads input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
   - Processes a 2D list of integers representing rows and calculates a cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - Computes the sum of costs for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum of these sums.

#### Function Summary:
- The summary states that `func_2` reads input values, calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`, and then computes the sum of costs for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows to find the minimum total cost.
- However, the summary does not address the correctness of `func_1` in terms of optimal support placement.

#### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Implementation in `func_1`**:
  - The current implementation of `func_1` does not ensure that supports are placed optimally according to the problem constraints.
  - It incorrectly adds 1 to the first `d-1` elements without considering the optimal placement.
  - The logic for finding the minimum cost up to the previous `d` elements does not guarantee optimal placement.

- **Handling Consecutive Rows in `func_2`**:
  - `func_2` correctly computes the sum of costs for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
  - However, since `func_1` is incorrect, the overall solution is also incorrect.

#### Example Case:
Consider the example case provided in the original assessment:
```
1
3 5 2 2
0 1 2 1 0
0 2 3 2 0
0 1 2 1 0
```
- Expected Output: `8`
- The provided program does not handle the optimal placement of supports correctly, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the solution due to the incorrect implementation of `func_1`.

**Final:** **False**
