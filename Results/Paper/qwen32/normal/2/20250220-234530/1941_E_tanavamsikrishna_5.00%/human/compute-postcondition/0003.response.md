Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of rows, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of columns, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of bridges, and `d` is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports such that 1 <= k <= n and 3 <= m and 1 <= d <= m. `rows` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`, where each element is an integer read from the input. `costs` is a list of length `n` where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows`. `total_costs` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The only change made by the code is the initialization of `total_costs` as an empty list. All other variables retain their initial values and properties.
