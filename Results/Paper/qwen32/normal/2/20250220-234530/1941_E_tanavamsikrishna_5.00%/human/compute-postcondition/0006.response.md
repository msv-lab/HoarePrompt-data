The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to the length of `costs` minus `(k - 1)`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was some value such that the loop condition `i < len(costs) - (k - 1)` was true. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and this new value of `i` must still satisfy the loop condition.

Given that `len(costs)` is equal to `n` (as `costs` is a list of length `n`), the loop will continue as long as `i < n - (k - 1)`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of rows, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of columns, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of bridges, `d` is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports such that 1 <= k <= n and 3 <= m and 1 <= d <= m, `rows` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`, `costs` is a list of length `n` where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows`, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`, `i` is incremented by 1**
