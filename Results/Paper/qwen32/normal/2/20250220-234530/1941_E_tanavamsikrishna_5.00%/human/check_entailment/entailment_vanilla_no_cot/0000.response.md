Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Specifically, `func_1` does not properly calculate the minimum cost of placing supports in a row according to the rules given. It incorrectly adds 1 to the first `d-1` elements and then calculates the rest based on a sliding window minimum, which does not account for the requirement that the distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to use dynamic programming to find the minimum cost of placing supports in each row such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is at most `d`. Then, we can find the minimum total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from typing import List

def min_cost_for_row(row: List[int], d: int) -> int:
    n = len(row)
    dp = [float('inf')] * n
    dp[0] = row[0] + 1
    dp[n - 1] = row[n - 1] + 1
    
    # Forward pass
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        dp[i] = min(dp[j] + row[i] + 1 for j in range(max(0, i - d), i))
    
    # Backward pass
    for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], min(dp[j] + row[i] + 1 for j in range(i + 1, min(i + d + 1, n))))
    
    return dp[n - 1]

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        m = int(data[index + 1])
        k = int(data[index + 2])
        d = int(data[index + 3])
        index += 4
        
        rows = []
        for _ in range(n):
            rows.append([int(data[index + j]) for j in range(m)])
            index += m
        
        costs = [min_cost_for_row(row, d) for row in rows]
        total_costs = []
        for i in range(n - k + 1):
            total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
        
        results.append(min(total_costs))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code correctly calculates the minimum cost for placing supports in each row and then finds the minimum total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges.
