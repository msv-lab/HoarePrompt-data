The code appends the sum of a slice of the `costs` list (from index `i` to `i + k`) to the `total_costs` list. This means that the `total_costs` list will now contain one additional element, which is the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 before this line of code is executed, the new element added to `total_costs` is the sum of the costs from the `i`-th row to the `(i + k - 1)`-th row.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of rows, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of columns, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of bridges, `d` is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports such that 1 <= k <= n and 3 <= m and 1 <= d <= m, `rows` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`, `costs` is a list of length `n` where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows`, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of `costs[i:i + k]` for all previously considered slices, plus the newly appended sum `sum(costs[i:i + k])`.**
