Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the minimum cost of placing supports in a single row such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`. Here is the function again for reference:

```python
def func_1(row: List[int], d: int):
    for i in range(0, d - 1):
        row[i] = row[i] + 1
    for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):
        row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
    return row[-1]
```

#### Issues:
1. **First Loop**: The first loop `for i in range(0, d - 1):` simply adds 1 to the first `d-1` elements. This does not consider the optimal placement of supports.
2. **Second Loop**: The second loop `for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):` attempts to find the minimum cost up to the previous `d` elements, but it does not ensure that the supports are placed optimally or within the required distance `d`.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
The function `func_2` reads the input, calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`, and then computes the sum of costs for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows to find the minimum total cost. Here is the function again for reference:

```python
def func_2():
    (n, m, k, d) = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
    print(min(total_costs))
```

#### Issues:
1. **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation for each row using `func_1` is flawed as discussed above.
2. **Consecutive Rows**: The function correctly computes the sum of costs for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows, but since the individual row costs are incorrect, the overall result is also incorrect.

### Example Case:
Let's consider the example case provided in the original assessment:

```
1
3 5 2 2
0 1 2 1 0
0 2 3 2 0
0 1 2 1 0
```

#### Expected Output:
The expected output is `8`.

#### Explanation:
- For the first row, the optimal placement of supports could be at positions 1, 3, and 5 with a cost of `0 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 4`.
- For the second row, the optimal placement of supports could be at positions 1, 3, and 5 with a cost of `0 + 3 + 0 + 2 = 5`.
- For the third row, the optimal placement of supports could be at positions 1, 3, and 5 with a cost of `0 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 4`.
- The minimum total cost for building bridges on two consecutive rows would be `4 + 5 = 9` or `5 + 4 = 9`, but the optimal solution is `8` which can be achieved by placing supports differently.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem described. The function `func_1` does not ensure the optimal placement of supports, and consequently, the function `func_2` produces incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
