The given code snippet creates a new list called `costs` by applying the function `func_1` to each row in the 2D list `rows`. The function `func_1` presumably computes some cost based on the row and the parameter `d`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific values that will be stored in `costs`. However, we know that `costs` will be a list of length `n` (the number of rows), where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of rows, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of columns, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of bridges, and `d` is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports such that 1 <= k <= n and 3 <= m and 1 <= d <= m. `rows` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`, where each element is an integer read from the input. `costs` is a list of length `n` where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows`.**
