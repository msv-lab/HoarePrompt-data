### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Understanding:
The task is to find the minimum cost of building `k` bridges over consecutive rows of a grid where:
- Each bridge spans from the first column to the last column.
- The cost of placing a support at `(i, j)` is `a[i][j] + 1`.
- Supports must be placed in the first and last columns.
- The distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.

#### Key Points:
1. **Cost Calculation**: For each row, we need to calculate the minimum cost of placing supports such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
2. **Consecutive Rows**: After calculating the cost for each row individually, we need to find the minimum sum of costs for `k` consecutive rows.

#### Analysis of the Given Program:
##### Function `func_1`:
- This function is supposed to calculate the minimum cost for placing supports in a single row.
- The function iterates through the row and uses dynamic programming to ensure that the distance between supports is no more than `d`.
- However, the function does not explicitly ensure that supports are placed in the first and last columns, which is a critical requirement.

Here is the problematic part of `func_1`:
```python
for i in range(0, d - 1):
    row[i] = row[i] + 1
for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):
    row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
return row[-1]
```
- The first loop adds 1 to the first `d-1` elements, which does not necessarily place a support in the first column.
- The second loop calculates the cost based on the minimum value within a sliding window of size `d+1`, but it does not ensure that the last column has a support.

##### Function `func_2`:
- Reads input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
- Reads the grid of depths.
- Uses `func_1` to calculate the cost for each row.
- Iterates through the calculated costs to find the minimum sum of costs for `k` consecutive rows.
- Prints the result.

#### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The `func_1` function does not correctly handle the requirement that supports must be placed in the first and last columns. It also does not ensure that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d` in a way that respects the placement of supports in the first and last columns.
2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` needs to be adjusted to ensure that the first and last columns always have supports and that the distance constraint is respected.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, particularly the incorrect handling of the constraints related to placing supports in the first and last columns and ensuring the distance constraint, the program is not correct.

**Final: False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description due to the incorrect implementation of the cost calculation for placing supports in each row.
