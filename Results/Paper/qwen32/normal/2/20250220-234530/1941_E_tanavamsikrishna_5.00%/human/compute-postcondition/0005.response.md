The code snippet appends the sum of a slice of the `costs` list to the `total_costs` list. Specifically, it calculates the sum of elements from index `i` to `i + k` in the `costs` list and appends this sum to `total_costs`. 

Given the initial state, `total_costs` was an empty list. After executing the code, `total_costs` will contain one element, which is the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of rows, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of columns, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of bridges, `d` is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports such that 1 <= k <= n and 3 <= m and 1 <= d <= m, `rows` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`, `costs` is a list of length `n` where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows`, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`**.
