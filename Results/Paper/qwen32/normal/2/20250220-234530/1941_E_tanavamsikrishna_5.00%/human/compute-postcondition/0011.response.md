To determine the output of the `print(min(total_costs))` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the computation involved:

1. **Variables and their roles**:
   - `n`: Number of rows in the 2D list `rows`.
   - `m`: Number of columns in the 2D list `rows`.
   - `k`: Number of bridges, which is also the number of consecutive rows whose costs are summed up to form an element in `total_costs`.
   - `d`: Maximum distance between supports, but it does not directly influence the calculation of `total_costs`.
   - `rows`: A 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`.
   - `costs`: A list of length `n` where each element is the result of applying `func_1` to the corresponding row in `rows`.
   - `total_costs`: A list containing the sum of `costs[i:i + k]` for all `i` from `0` to `n - k`.

2. **Computation Steps**:
   - For each row in `rows`, `func_1` is applied to compute a cost, resulting in the list `costs`.
   - `total_costs` is then computed by taking the sum of `k` consecutive elements in `costs` starting from each index `i` from `0` to `n - k`.

3. **Determining the Output**:
   - The `print(min(total_costs))` statement will print the minimum value among all the sums in `total_costs`.

Given the initial state, we know the following:
- `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers with specific constraints.
- `rows` is a 2D list of integers.
- `costs` is derived from `rows` using `func_1`.
- `total_costs` is a list of sums of `k` consecutive elements in `costs`.

However, without the specific values of `rows` and the definition of `func_1`, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `costs` and `total_costs`. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of the computation process.

Output: **min(total_costs) (where total_costs is a list of sums of k consecutive elements in costs, and costs is a list of values obtained by applying func_1 to each row in rows)**
