### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem statement.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
- We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
  - \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
  - \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
  - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Given Program Analysis:
The provided program calculates the number of valid pairs using the following logic:
- It initializes `ans` to `n`, which accounts for the pairs where \(b = 1\).
- Then, for each \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\), it adds \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to `ans`.

Let's verify if this logic correctly counts the number of valid pairs.

##### Verification:
1. **Case \(b = 1\)**:
   - When \(b = 1\), \(a + b = a + 1\) needs to be a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1) = 1\). This condition is always true, so all pairs \((a, 1)\) for \(1 \leq a \leq n\) are valid. There are \(n\) such pairs.
   - The program correctly initializes `ans` to `n` to account for these pairs.

2. **Case \(b > 1\)**:
   - For \(b > 1\), we need \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Let's denote \(\gcd(a, b) = d\). Then \(a = kd\) and \(b = ld\) for some integers \(k\) and \(l\) where \(\gcd(k, l) = 1\).
   - The condition becomes \(kd + ld = d(k + l)\) being a multiple of \(ld \cdot d = ld^2\).
   - Simplifying, we get \(k + l\) being a multiple of \(ld\).
   - This implies \(k + l = p \cdot ld\) for some integer \(p\).
   - Rearranging, \(k = p \cdot ld - l = l(pd - 1)\).
   - Since \(\gcd(k, l) = 1\), \(pd - 1\) must be coprime with \(l\).

Given the above, the program's logic of adding \((n + b) // (b * b)\) for each \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\) does not directly match the derived condition. The program seems to be using a heuristic or approximation that does not guarantee correctness for all possible values of \(n\) and \(m\).

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
