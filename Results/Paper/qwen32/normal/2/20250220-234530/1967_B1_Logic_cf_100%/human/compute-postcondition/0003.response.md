The code snippet converts the strings `n` and `m` into integers. Therefore, the values of `n` and `m` are updated to be integers instead of strings.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer representing the first number from the input, `m` is an integer representing the second number from the input.**
