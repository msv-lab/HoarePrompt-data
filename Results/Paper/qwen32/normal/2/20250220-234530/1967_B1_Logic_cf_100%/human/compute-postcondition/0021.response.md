To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `b`, `n`, and `m`. The loop iterates over `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)` inclusive.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `m` must be at least 2.
- `b` is incremented by 1 (`b = b + 1`).
- `ans` is updated based on the formula `ans = ans + (n + b + 1) // ((b + 1) * (b + 1))`.

Since `b` is incremented at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `b` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

Let's break down the steps:
1. The current value of `b` at the start of this iteration is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.
2. `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `b` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` and `m` remain the same.

Given that `b` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `b` will be `b + 1` from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `b` is `b + 1`, `ans` is `ans + (n + b + 1) // ((b + 1) * (b + 1))`**

However, to clearly indicate the new value of `b` at the start of the next iteration, we should express it as:

State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `b` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**
