To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each pair of integers `(n, m)` provided as input and calculates the value of `ans` for each pair.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `t` is the total number of test cases (iterations).
   - For each iteration `T` (ranging from 0 to `t-1`):
     - Read two integers `n` and `m`.
     - Initialize `ans` to `n`.
     - For each integer `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`:
       - Update `ans` by adding the result of `(n + b) // (b * b)`.

2. **Execution**:
   - The loop runs `t` times, processing each pair of integers `(n, m)` independently.
   - For each pair, `ans` is calculated based on the formula provided and printed.

3. **Final State**:
   - After all iterations, the loop has processed all `t` pairs of integers.
   - Each `ans` value is printed as it is computed, so there isn't a single accumulated `ans` value at the end of all iterations.

Given the above, the final output state can be described as follows:

**Output State**: **Each `ans` value corresponding to each pair of integers `(n, m)` is printed sequentially.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop, the program will have printed `t` lines, each containing the value of `ans` calculated for the respective pair of integers `(n, m)` read from the input. There is no single final state variable; instead, the output consists of multiple lines of output, one for each iteration.
