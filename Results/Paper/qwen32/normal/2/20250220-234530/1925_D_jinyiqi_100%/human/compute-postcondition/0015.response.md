The code calculates `cn2` using the formula `n * (n - 1) // 2`. This calculation does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, or `sum_f`; only `cn2` is updated.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read during the `m` iterations, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.**
