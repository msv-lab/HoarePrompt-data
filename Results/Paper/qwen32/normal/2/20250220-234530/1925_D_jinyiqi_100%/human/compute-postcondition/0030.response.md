The code snippet provided increments `sum_f` by the value of `f`. Given the initial state, `sum_f` was initially set to `f`. After executing the line `sum_f += f`, `sum_f` will now be equal to `f + f`, which simplifies to `2 * f`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the first input integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is `2 * f`, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the three integers read from the input, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` divided by `gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, `j` is 1**.
