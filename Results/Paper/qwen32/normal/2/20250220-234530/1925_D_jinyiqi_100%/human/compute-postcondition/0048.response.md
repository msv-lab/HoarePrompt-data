The only variable in the loop head is `j` and `m`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4,
- `i` is 2,
- `n` is the first input integer,
- `m` must be greater than 0,
- `k` is the third input integer,
- `sum_f` is `sum_f + f`,
- `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`,
- `a`, `b`, and `f` are the newly read values from the input,
- `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`,
- `q` is `2 * cn2 // gcd`,
- `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would have taken some value, and since we are moving to the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `m`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` should be incremented by 1.
- `m` remains unchanged because it defines the upper limit of the loop.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is `sum_f + f`, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the newly read values from the input, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * cn2 // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, `j` is incremented by 1**
