The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was incremented, so it needs to be set to the next value.

Given that `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 1 (assuming this is the first iteration after initialization).

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is `f`, `a` is the first of the new input integers, `b` is the second of the new input integers, `f` is the third of the new input integers, `j` is 1**
