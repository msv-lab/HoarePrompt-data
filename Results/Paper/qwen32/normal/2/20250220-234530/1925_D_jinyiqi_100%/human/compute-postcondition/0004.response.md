The code snippet initializes a new variable `sum_f` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, or `k`. 

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is 0.**
