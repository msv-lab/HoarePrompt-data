The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state mentions that `t` is an input integer within a specific range and `i` is 0. After executing the code, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` will be set according to the input, while `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer.**
