The code snippet provided modifies the variable `q` by dividing it by `gcd`. Given the initial state, the value of `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)`, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.

After executing the code, `q` is updated to `q // gcd`. This means that `q` is now the result of the division of its original value by `gcd`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read during the `m` iterations, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` divided by `gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**
