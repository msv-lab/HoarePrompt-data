The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be one more than its current value.

Given that `j` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, if `j` was 1 at the start of that iteration, it would now be 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `j` incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is `sum_f + f`, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the newly read values from the input, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * cn2 // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, `j` is 3** (assuming `j` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration)
