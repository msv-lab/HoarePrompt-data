The code snippet `sum_f += f` increments the variable `sum_f` by the value of `f`. Given the initial state, `sum_f` was 0, and after executing the code, `sum_f` will be equal to the value of `f`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is `f`, `a` is the first of the new input integers, `b` is the second of the new input integers, `f` is the third of the new input integers.**
