To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to consider the changes made by each iteration of the loop. The loop runs `m` times, and during each iteration, it reads three integers (`a`, `b`, `f`), adds `f` to `sum_f`, and recalculates `p` and `q` based on the updated `sum_f`.

Here's a breakdown of the final state:

- `t`: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `i`: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `n`: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `m`: Remains unchanged as it is used to control the loop but not modified within it.
- `k`: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `sum_f`: This variable accumulates the sum of all `f` values read during the `m` iterations.
- `cn2`: Remains unchanged as it is calculated once before the loop starts and not modified within the loop.
- `a`, `b`, `f`: These variables hold the last set of values read from the input during the last iteration of the loop.
- `p` and `q`: These are recalculated using the final value of `sum_f` after all iterations.

After the loop completes all `m` iterations, the final state will be:

- `sum_f` will be the sum of all `f` values read during the `m` iterations.
- `a`, `b`, `f` will be the values read during the last iteration.
- `p` and `q` will be recalculated using the final `sum_f`.

Therefore, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read during the `m` iterations, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the values read during the last iteration, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * cn2 // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `sum_f` holds the total sum of all `f` values read, `a`, `b`, and `f` hold the values from the last iteration, and `p` and `q` are recalculated based on the final `sum_f`. All other variables remain unchanged.
