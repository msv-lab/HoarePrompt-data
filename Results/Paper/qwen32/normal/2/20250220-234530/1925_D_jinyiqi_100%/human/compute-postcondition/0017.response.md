The code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `q` based on the existing value of `cn2`. The value of `q` is calculated as `2 * cn2 ** 2`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given that `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, the value of `q` will be `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) ** 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read during the `m` iterations, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) ** 2`**.
