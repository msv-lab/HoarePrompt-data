The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `f`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `sum_f` is initially given as `2 * f`, but since `f` is reassigned, `sum_f` will no longer reflect `2 * f` unless recalculated.

Given the initial state and the code execution, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is 2 * f (initially, now outdated), `a` is the first of the new input integers, `b` is the second of the new input integers, `f` is the third of the new input integers, `j` is 2**. 

In simpler terms: The variables `a`, `b`, and `f` are updated to the new input integers, while the other variables retain their original values. Note that `sum_f` is initially `2 * f` but is now outdated because `f` has been reassigned.
