The given code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This means that the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` will be updated based on the input, while the other variables (`i`, `sum_f`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, `gcd`) remain unchanged unless further operations are performed on them.

Given the initial state, the only variables that will be updated are `n`, `m`, and `k`. Since the exact input values are not provided, we will denote them as the values obtained from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read during the `m` iterations, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` divided by `gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**
