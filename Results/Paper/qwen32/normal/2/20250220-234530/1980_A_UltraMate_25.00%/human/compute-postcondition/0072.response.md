The code snippet `ans += m` increments the value of `ans` by `m`. Given that `ans` was initially either `m` or `0` based on whether `'E'` was a key in `hmp`, after the operation, `ans` will be either `2*m` (if `'E'` was a key in `hmp`) or `m` (if `'E'` was not a key in `hmp`).

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` is at least 2, `s` is the input string, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`, `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in `s`, `i` is `'E'`, `ans` is either `2*m` or `m` based on whether `'E'` was a key in `hmp`.**
