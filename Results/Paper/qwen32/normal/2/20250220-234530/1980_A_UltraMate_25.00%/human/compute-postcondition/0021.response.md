The code snippet `ans += m - hmp[i]` modifies the value of `ans` by adding the difference between `m` and `hmp[i]` to it. The other variables (`k`, `s`, `hmp`, `i`, and `m`) remain unchanged in terms of their definitions and conditions.

Given that `ans` was initially `k * m`, where `k` is the number of characters in 'ABCDEF' not present in `s`, and `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, the new value of `ans` will be `k * m + (m - hmp[i])`.

Output State: **`ans` is `k * m + m - hmp[i]`, `hmp` is an iterable with at least one element, the current value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.**
