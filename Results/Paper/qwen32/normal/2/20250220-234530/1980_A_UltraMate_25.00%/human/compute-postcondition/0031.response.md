To determine what will be printed, let's carefully analyze the initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Expression**: `k * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)`
   - This expression seems to be calculating a value based on the variables `k`, `m`, and a dictionary `hmp`.
   - `k` and `m` are variables with unknown explicit values.
   - `hmp` is a dictionary where the keys are not specified, but the values are used in the expression.

2. **Variable `ans`**:
   - The initial state does not explicitly define `ans`. However, based on the context, it's reasonable to infer that `ans` is assigned the result of the expression mentioned above.
   - Therefore, `ans = k * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)`

### Print Statement Analysis:

- The print statement is `print(ans)`.
- Since `ans` is the result of the expression `k * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)`, we need to describe this expression in the output.

### Output Description:

Given the initial state, the value of `ans` is derived from the formula `k * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)`. Without specific values for `k`, `m`, and `hmp`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe it precisely based on the given information.

Output: **ans (where ans is calculated as k * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m))**
