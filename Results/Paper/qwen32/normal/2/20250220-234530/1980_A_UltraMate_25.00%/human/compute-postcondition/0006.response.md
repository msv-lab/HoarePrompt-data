The code snippet creates a `Counter` object named `hmp` from the string `s`. This means `hmp` will be a dictionary-like object where keys are the unique characters in `s` and values are their respective counts.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `hmp`, which is newly created. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `ans`, `p`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` and `m` are integers input by the user such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 5; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'; `s` is a string input by the user; `ans` is 0; `p` is 'ABCDEF'; `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in `s`.**
