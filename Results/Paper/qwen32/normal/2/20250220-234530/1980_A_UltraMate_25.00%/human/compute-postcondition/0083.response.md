Output State: **`ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`; `hmp` remains a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `i` is `next_key`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding the difference between `m` and the value of `hmp[i]`. The dictionary `hmp` and the variable `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
