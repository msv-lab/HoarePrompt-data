The given code snippet increments the variable `ans` by the value of `m`. Therefore, we need to adjust the value of `ans` accordingly.

Initial State: 
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `k * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)` is a calculated value
- `t` is greater than 0
- `s` is an input string
- `p` is `'ABCDEF'`
- `hmp` is a Counter object containing characters from `s` as keys and their counts as values
- `i` is `'E'`
- `ans` is `m` if `'D'` is not a key in `hmp`, otherwise `ans` is `2 * m`

After executing `ans += m`:
- If `'D'` was not a key in `hmp`, `ans` was initially `m` and now it becomes `m + m = 2 * m`.
- If `'D'` was a key in `hmp`, `ans` was initially `2 * m` and now it becomes `2 * m + m = 3 * m`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)` is a calculated value, `t` is greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`, `hmp` is a Counter object containing characters from `s` as keys and their counts as values, `i` is `'E'`, `ans` is `2 * m` if `'D'` is not a key in `hmp`, otherwise `ans` is `3 * m`**
