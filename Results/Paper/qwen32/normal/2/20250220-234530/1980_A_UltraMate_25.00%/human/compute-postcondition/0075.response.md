The code snippet `ans += m` increments the value of `ans` by `m`. Given the initial conditions, `ans` is initially set to either `2*m` or `m` depending on whether `'F'` is a key in `hmp`. After the operation, `ans` will be either `3*m` or `2*m`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` is at least 2, `s` is the input string, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`, `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in `s`, `i` is `'F'`. If `'F'` is not a key in `hmp`, `ans` is `3*m`. Otherwise, `ans` is `2*m`.**
