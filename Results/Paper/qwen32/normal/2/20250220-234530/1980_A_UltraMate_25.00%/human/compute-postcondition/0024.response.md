The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of `m - hmp[i]` to its current value. The value of `i` remains the next element in `hmp`. The other variables (`hmp` and `m`) are not altered by this operation.

Output State: **`ans` is recalculated based on the next element in `hmp` plus `m - hmp[i]`, `i` is the next element in `hmp`**.
