The code snippet `num -= 1` decrements the value of `num` by 1. Given the initial state, `num` is initially calculated as `min(less) - max(big) + 1`. After the decrement, `num` will be `min(less) - max(big) + 1 - 1`, which simplifies to `min(less) - max(big)`.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`num` is `min(less) - max(big)`, `iterable` is 3, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `big` contains all `a` values where `x` was 1, `less` contains all `a` values where `x` was 2, `no` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in `no`**.
