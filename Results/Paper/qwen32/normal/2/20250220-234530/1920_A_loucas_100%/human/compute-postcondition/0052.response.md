The code snippet `big = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `big`. This does not affect the values of `num`, `iterable`, `loop`, or `less`, which remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1 - count_in_range`, `iterable` is 3, `loop` is unchanged, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list**.
