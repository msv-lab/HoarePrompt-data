The given code snippet appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. No other variables are modified in the provided code.

Given the initial state, the only change is that the list `big` now includes the value of `a` appended to it. All other variables retain their original states and constraints.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, constraints are represented by distinct pairs (a, x) where a is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, `loop` is greater than 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer read from input, `a` is the second integer read from input, `iterable2` is `k + 2` where `k` is the value of `iterable2` at the end of the previous iteration, `big` contains its previous elements plus the value of `a`, `less` is unchanged, `no` is unchanged.**
