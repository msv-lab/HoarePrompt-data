To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes the input and modifies the lists `big`, `less`, and `no`. The loop iterates `innerLoop` times, reading pairs of integers `(x, a)` from the input. Depending on the value of `x`, it appends `a` to either `big`, `less`, or `no`.

### Analysis of the Loop:
- **Initialization**: 
  - `big`, `less`, and `no` are initially empty lists.
  - `num` is 0 and remains unchanged throughout the loop.
  - `innerLoop` determines the total number of iterations.

- **Iteration Process**:
  - For each iteration, the loop reads a pair `(x, a)`.
  - If `x` is 1, `a` is appended to `big`.
  - If `x` is 2, `a` is appended to `less`.
  - If `x` is 3, `a` is appended to `no`.

### Final Output State:
After all `innerLoop` iterations, the lists `big`, `less`, and `no` will contain all the values of `a` that were read from the input, categorized based on the corresponding `x` values.

### Output State in the Required Format:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, constraints are represented by distinct pairs (a, x) where a is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, `loop` is greater than 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 1, `less` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 2, and `no` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 3.**

### Human-readable Description:
After the loop has executed all `innerLoop` iterations, the list `big` will hold all the values of `a` that were paired with `x` equal to 1. Similarly, the list `less` will hold all the values of `a` that were paired with `x` equal to 2, and the list `no` will hold all the values of `a` that were paired with `x` equal to 3. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `loop`, `num`) remain unchanged as per their initial conditions.
