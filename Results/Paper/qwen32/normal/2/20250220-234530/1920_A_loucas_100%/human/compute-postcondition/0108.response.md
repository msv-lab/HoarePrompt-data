The code appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. Since `a` is the second integer from the input, the list `big` will now contain this value. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`num` is 0, `iterable` is 4, `loop` is greater than 4, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` is [the second integer from the input], `less` is [], `no` is [], `x` is 1, `a` is the second integer from the input.**
