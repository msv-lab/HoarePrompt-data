Postcondition: **`num` is 0, `iterable` is 4, `loop` is greater than 4, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` is an empty list, `x` is the first integer from the input and `x` is not equal to 1, `a` is the second integer from the input. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing `a` and `no` is an empty list. Otherwise, `less` is an empty list and `no` is a list containing `a`.**
