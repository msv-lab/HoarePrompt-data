The code snippet sets `num` to 0, which overrides its initial value. The other variables (`iterable`, `loop`, `innerLoop`, `big`, `less`, `no`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is 0, `iterable` is 4, `loop` must be greater than 4, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `big` is [], `less` is [], `no` is []**.
