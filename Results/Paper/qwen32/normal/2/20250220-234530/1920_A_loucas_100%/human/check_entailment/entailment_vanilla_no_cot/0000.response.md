Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the calculation of `num`, which represents the number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. Specifically, the line `num = min(less) - max(big) + 1` does not correctly account for the possibility that `max(big)` could be greater than `min(less)`, which would result in a negative or zero value for `num`. In such cases, the correct number of integers `k` should be `0`, but the program may incorrectly proceed to subtract elements from `no` from `num`.

To fix this, the program should include a check to ensure that `max(big)` is not greater than `min(less)` before proceeding with the subtraction of elements from `no`. Here's a corrected version of the relevant part of the code:

```python
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        big = []
        no = []
        num = 0
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            (x, a) = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)
        lower_bound = max(big)
        upper_bound = min(less)
        if lower_bound > upper_bound:
            print(0)
            continue
        num = upper_bound - lower_bound + 1
        for i in no:
            if lower_bound <= i <= upper_bound:
                num -= 1
        print(num)
```

This corrected version ensures that `num` is only calculated when there is a valid range between `lower_bound` and `upper_bound`, and it properly handles the case where no valid `k` exists.
