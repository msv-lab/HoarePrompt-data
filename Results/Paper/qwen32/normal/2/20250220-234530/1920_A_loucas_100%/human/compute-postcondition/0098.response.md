To determine what will be printed, let's break down the expression for `num`:

- `min(less)`: This is the minimum value in the list `less`, which contains all `a` values where `x` was 2.
- `max(big)`: This is the maximum value in the list `big`, which contains all `a` values where `x` was 1.
- `countInRange`: This is a variable representing the count of some values within a specified range, but its exact definition or value isn't provided in the initial state.

Given these components, the expression for `num` is:
\[ \text{num} = \text{min(less)} - \text{max(big)} + 1 - \text{countInRange} \]

Since the exact values of `less`, `big`, and `countInRange` are not provided, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for `num`. However, we can describe it precisely based on the given information.

Output: **num (where num is calculated as min(less) - max(big) + 1 - countInRange)**
