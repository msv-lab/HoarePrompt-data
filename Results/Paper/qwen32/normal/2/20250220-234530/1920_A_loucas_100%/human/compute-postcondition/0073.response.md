Postcondition: **`num` is 0, `iterable` is 3, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is greater than 2, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing `a`, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `big` is an empty list, `less` is a list containing `a`, and `no` is an empty list. Otherwise, `big` and `less` are empty lists, and `no` is a list containing `a`. `iterable2` is 2.**
