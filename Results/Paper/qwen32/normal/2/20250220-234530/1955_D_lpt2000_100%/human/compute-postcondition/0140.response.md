Output State: **`aa` must have at least `max(m, n - m)` elements, `m` must be less than `n`. The current value of `D[out_aa]` is its previous value minus 1 (and is greater than or equal to 0), and `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0. `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The only change in the state is that `pairs_in_D` is decremented by 1. All other conditions and values remain the same.
