Output State: **`aa` must have at least `max(m, n - m)` elements, `m` must be less than `n`. The current value of `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, and the current value of `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1.**

In simple terms: The conditions about `aa`, `m`, and `n` remain the same. The value of `D[out_aa]` remains unchanged and is still greater than 0. The value of `E[out_aa]` is now one less than its previous value and is still greater than 0.
