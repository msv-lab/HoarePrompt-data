Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `nabors` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `aa` is a list of strings representing the integers from the input line with length `n`; `bb` is a list of strings representing the integers from the new input line with length `m`; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of each unique element in the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of each unique element in the list `bb`; `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`; `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`; `E` is a Counter object representing the remaining elements in `cnt_aa` that were not part of the maximum intersection; `C` is a Counter object representing the remaining elements in `cnt_bb` that were not part of the intersection `D`; `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0; `_` is incremented by 1; `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the values read from the input. `aa` is a list of strings representing the integers from the input line with length `n`. `bb` is now a list of strings representing the integers from the newly read input line with length `m`. `E` is a Counter object representing the remaining elements in `cnt_aa` that were not part of the intersection `D`.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            pairs_in_D -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        D[in_aa] += 1
        pairs_in_D += 1
        C[in_aa] -= 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `nabors` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `aa` is a list of strings representing the integers from the input line with length `n` and `m < n`; `bb` is a list of strings representing the integers from the new input line with length `m`; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of each unique element in the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of each unique element in the list `bb`; `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`. If `C[in_aa]` was greater than 0, then `C[in_aa]` is decremented by 1 and `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `C[in_aa]` remains 0 and `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`, which may be incremented by 1 if `C[in_aa]` was greater than 0. `E` is a Counter object representing the remaining elements in `cnt_aa` that were not part of the maximum intersection. `C` is a Counter object representing the remaining elements in `cnt_bb` that were not part of the intersection `D`. `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `_` is incremented by 1; `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the values read from the input. `aa` is a list of strings representing the integers from the input line with length `n` and `m < n`. `bb` is now a list of strings representing the integers from the newly read input line with length `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `nabors` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `aa` is a list of strings representing the integers from the input line with length `n` and `m < n`; `bb` is a list of strings representing the integers from the new input line with length `m`; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of each unique element in the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of each unique element in the list `bb`; `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`. If `C[in_aa]` > 0, then `C[in_aa]` is decremented by 1 and `pairs_in_D` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1 if `D[out_aa]` > 0, `pairs_in_D` is reduced by 1 if `D[out_aa]` was decremented, and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1 if `D[out_aa]` was decremented. Otherwise, `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` (after any decrement) is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `_` is incremented by 1; `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the values read from the input; `aa` is a list of strings representing the integers from the input line with length `n` and `m < n`; `bb` is now a list of strings representing the integers from the newly read input line with length `m`; `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`; `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]; `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`. If `D[out_aa] > 0`, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. If `D[out_aa] <= 0`, `E[out_aa]` is also decreased by 1. If `C[in_aa] > 0`, then `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1. `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D >= k` else `fnd` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
