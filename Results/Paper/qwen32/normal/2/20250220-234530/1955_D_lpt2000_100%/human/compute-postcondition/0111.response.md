The code snippet `C[out_aa] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `out_aa` in the dictionary `C` by 1. 

Given the initial state:
- `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`
- `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`
- `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1
- `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1

After executing the code, only `C[out_aa]` is affected. All other variables retain their initial state.

Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1.**
