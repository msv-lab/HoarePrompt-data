To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `i` is `i + 2` (Note: This doesn't affect the current print statement, so we can ignore it for now).
- `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers obtained from the input.
- `x` is calculated as `abs(xa - xb) // 2`.
- `l` is calculated as `max(1, ya - (abs(xa - xb) // 2))`.
- `r` is calculated as `min(w, yb + x)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x])
```

### Analysis:
1. The expression inside the brackets `[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x]` evaluates to a boolean value.
2. If the boolean value is `True`, the expression evaluates to the second element of the tuple `(['Draw'], ['Bob'])`, which is `['Bob']`.
3. If the boolean value is `False`, the expression evaluates to the first element of the tuple `(['Draw'], ['Bob'])`, which is `['Draw']`.

### Conditions:
- `abs(l - yb) <= x`: This checks if the absolute difference between `l` and `yb` is less than or equal to `x`.
- `abs(r - yb) <= x`: This checks if the absolute difference between `r` and `yb` is less than or equal to `x`.

### Conclusion:
- If both conditions are true, the output will be `['Bob']`.
- Otherwise, the output will be `['Draw']`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output either `['Bob']` or `['Draw']` based on the conditions `abs(l - yb) <= x` and `abs(r - yb) <= x`.

Output: **['Bob'] or ['Draw'] (depending on whether abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x)**
