The given code snippet reads six integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb`. No other operations are performed in the provided code snippet, so only these variables are updated.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `i + 1`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers obtained from the input.**
The variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` now hold the values read from the input. The variables `t` and `i` remain unchanged, and the conditions related to `x`, `l`, and `r` are not evaluated since they depend on subsequent logic not present in the provided code snippet.
