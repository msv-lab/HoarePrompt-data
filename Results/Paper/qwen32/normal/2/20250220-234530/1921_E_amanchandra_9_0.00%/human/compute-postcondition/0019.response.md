The value of `x` is assigned the result of the expression `abs(xa - xb) // 2`. This means `x` is now equal to half of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `i + 1`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers obtained from the input, `x` is `abs(xa - xb) // 2`.**
