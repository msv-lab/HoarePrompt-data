To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop processes each set of inputs and what it outputs based on the given conditions.

Here's a breakdown of the loop's behavior:
1. The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided as the first input.
2. For each iteration, it reads six integers: `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb`.
3. It checks if `xa > xb`. If true, it prints "Draw".
4. If `xa <= xb`, it calculates `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`.
5. Depending on whether `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is odd or even, it calculates `l` and `r` differently:
   - If `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is odd:
     - `l = max(1, yb - x)`
     - `r = min(w, yb + x)`
     - It then checks if both `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` are true. If so, it prints "Alice"; otherwise, it prints "Draw".
   - If `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is even:
     - `l = max(1, ya - x)`
     - `r = min(w, yb + x)`
     - It then checks if both `abs(l - yb) <= x` and `abs(r - yb) <= x` are true. If so, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Draw".

After all `t` iterations, the loop will have processed all test cases and printed the appropriate result for each one.

### Final Output State:
The final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations is simply the sequence of results (either "Draw", "Alice", or "Bob") printed for each of the `t` test cases.

**Output State:** **A sequence of `t` results, each being "Draw", "Alice", or "Bob", corresponding to the outcome of each test case.**

In natural language: The final output state consists of a list of results printed for each test case, indicating whether the game ends in a draw, Alice wins, or Bob wins, based on the conditions specified in the loop.
