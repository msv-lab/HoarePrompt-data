The code assigns the value of `abs(xa - xb) // 2` to the variable `x`. This means `x` is now half of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `i + 2`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers obtained from the input, `x` is `abs(xa - xb) // 2`.**
