The value of `x` is updated to be the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2 using integer division. The values of `t`, `i`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is the loop counter starting from 0, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers obtained from the input, `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`, `x` is `abs(xa - xb) // 2`.**
