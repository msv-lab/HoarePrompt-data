To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state step by step.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (not directly relevant to this specific print statement).
- `i` is the loop counter starting from 0 (not directly relevant to this specific print statement).
- `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers obtained from the input.
- `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`.
- `x` is calculated as `abs(xa - xb) // 2`.
- The absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd.
- `l` is calculated as `max(1, yb - x)`.
- `r` is calculated as `min(w, yb + x)`.

### Code Snippet Analysis:
```python
print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1])
```

This line uses Python's tuple indexing to select between two lists based on a condition. Let's break it down:

1. **Condition**: `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`
   - `l` is `max(1, yb - x)`.
   - `r` is `min(w, yb + x)`.
   - `ya` is one of the input values.
   - `x` is `abs(xa - xb) // 2`.

2. **Tuple Indexing**:
   - The expression evaluates to either `True` or `False`.
   - If the condition is `True`, it selects the second element of the tuple, which is `['Alice']`.
   - If the condition is `False`, it selects the first element of the tuple, which is `['Draw']`.

3. **Unpacking with `*` Operator**:
   - The `*` operator unpacks the selected list, so `print(*['Draw'])` would print `Draw` and `print(*['Alice'])` would print `Alice`.

### Determining the Output:
- The condition `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` needs to be evaluated.
- Since `l` and `r` are derived from `yb` and `x`, and `x` is half the odd difference between `xa` and `xb`, the condition checks if `ya` is within a certain range relative to `yb` and `x`.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the exact numerical values of `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are not provided, so we cannot definitively say whether the condition is `True` or `False`. However, we can describe the output based on the condition.

### Conclusion:
The output depends on whether the condition `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` is `True` or `False`.

- If `True`, the output is `Alice`.
- If `False`, the output is `Draw`.

Since we do not have the exact values to evaluate the condition, we can only describe the output in terms of the condition.

Output: **Alice (if abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1 is True), otherwise Draw**
