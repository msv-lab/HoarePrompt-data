The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Draw'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `i`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`), but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is described as an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, inclusive.
2. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`), but this operation does not affect the `print` statement.
3. The variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers obtained from the input, but they are not referenced in the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement only outputs the string `'Draw'`, the values of the other variables do not influence the output.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
