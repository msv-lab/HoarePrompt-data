Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `i + 1`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers obtained from the input, `x` is `abs(xa - xb) // 2`. If `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is true, then `l` is `max(1, yb - x)` and `r` is `min(w, yb + x)`. Otherwise, `l` is `max(1, ya - abs(xa - xb) // 2)` and `r` is `min(w, yb + x)`**.
