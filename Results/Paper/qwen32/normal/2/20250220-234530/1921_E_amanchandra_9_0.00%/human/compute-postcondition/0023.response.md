The code snippet assigns a value to the variable `l` using the `max` function, which compares `1` and `ya - x`. Given that `x` is defined as `abs(xa - xb) // 2`, the value of `l` will be the maximum of `1` and the result of `ya - abs(xa - xb) // 2`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `i + 1`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers obtained from the input, `x` is `abs(xa - xb) // 2`, `l` is `max(1, ya - abs(xa - xb) // 2)`**.
