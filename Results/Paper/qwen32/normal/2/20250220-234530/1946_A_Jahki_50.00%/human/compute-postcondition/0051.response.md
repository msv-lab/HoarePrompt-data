To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `new_median <= median`.

Given the provided state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`
- `num` is greater than 0
- `num2` is an input integer
- `case` is an input string
- `op` is 0
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `b` is the sorted version of `a`
- `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`
- `median` is `b[ma]`
- `new_median` is `median`

The loop condition `new_median <= median` will always be true if `new_median` is set to be equal to `median`. However, to ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to confirm that `new_median` is indeed equal to `median` initially.

Since `new_median` is initialized to `median`, no adjustment is required to make the loop execute the first time. The condition `new_median <= median` will hold true as long as `new_median` remains equal to `median`.

Thus, no changes are needed to the provided state.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `b` is the sorted version of `a`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`, `median` is `b[ma]`, `new_median` is `median`**
