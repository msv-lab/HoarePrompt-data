To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider how the loop evolves with each iteration and the conditions under which it terminates.

### Analysis of the Loop:
- **Loop Iteration**: The loop runs `num` times. Each iteration involves reading `num2` and `case`, processing `case` into a list of integers `a`, sorting `a` to get `b`, finding the median, and then incrementing the median until it becomes greater than its original value.
- **Termination Condition**: If `num2` is greater than 10000 during any iteration, the loop breaks, and specific outputs are printed (1 and 16668).
- **Output Calculation**: For each valid iteration (where `num2` is not greater than 10000), the number of increments (`op`) required to make the median of the list greater than its original value is calculated and printed.

### Final Output State:
- After all iterations (up to `num`), the loop will have processed each test case as described above.
- The final output state will reflect the results of these iterations, specifically the number of increments required for each valid test case.

### Output State Format:
Given the structure of the problem, the final output state will consist of the printed results from each iteration, which are either the number of operations (`op`) or the specific values 1 and 16668 if `num2` exceeds 10000.

### Final Output State Description:
- **Output State**: The final output state is a series of printed values, each corresponding to the result of one iteration of the loop. These values are either the number of operations (`op`) required to make the median greater than its original value or the values 1 and 16668 if `num2` is greater than 10000.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact values of `num2` and `case` are not provided, we can only describe the general form of the output state. However, based on the given information, the final output state will be a sequence of printed values reflecting the results of each iteration.

Output State: **A series of printed values, each being either the number of operations (`op`) required to make the median greater than its original value or the values 1 and 16668 if `num2` is greater than 10000.**
