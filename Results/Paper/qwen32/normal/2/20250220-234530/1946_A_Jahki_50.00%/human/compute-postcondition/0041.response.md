Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
- `num` is greater than 0.
- `num2` is an input integer.
- `case` is an input string.
- `op` is 0.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the integer `1`. None of the variables mentioned in the initial state (`t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `num2`, `case`, `op`, `i`) are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will always be the integer `1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1**
