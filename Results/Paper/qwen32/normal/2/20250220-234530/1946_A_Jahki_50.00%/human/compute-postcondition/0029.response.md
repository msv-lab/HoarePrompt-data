To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while new_median <= median:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to make sure that `new_median` is still less than or equal to `median`.

From the given state, we know:
- `median` is the element at index `ma` in the original sorted list `b`.
- `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]` after incrementing the element at index `ma` by 2.

Since `new_median` is calculated by incrementing the element at index `ma` by 2, `new_median` will always be greater than `median` unless the increment operation does not change the comparison due to some specific conditions (which is not the case here as `new_median` is explicitly set to `b[ma]` after the increment).

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`. However, based on the provided logic, `new_median` will inherently be greater than `median` after the increment. Thus, to satisfy the loop condition, we need to adjust `median` to be greater than `new_median`.

Given that `new_median` is `b[ma] + 2`, we need to ensure that `median` (which is `b[ma]` before the increment) is such that `b[ma] + 2 <= b[ma]`, which is impossible under normal circumstances. Therefore, to force the condition to be true, we need to adjust `median` to be greater than `b[ma] + 2`.

Let's denote the original value of `b[ma]` as `original_median_value`. After incrementing by 2, `new_median` becomes `original_median_value + 2`. To ensure the loop condition holds, `median` should be `original_median_value + 2` or less, but since we need to force another iteration, we can set `median` to be slightly greater than `original_median_value + 2`.

However, since we are asked to only adjust the states of objects in the loop head (`new_median` and `median`), and considering the logic, we need to ensure `median` is greater than `new_median` which is `b[ma] + 2`.

Thus, the state should be adjusted as follows:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer that is less than or equal to 10000, `case` is an input string, `op` is 2, `b` is the sorted list of integers derived from `a` with the element at index `ma` incremented by 2, `ma` is calculated as `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, or `(num2 - 1) // 2` if `num2` is odd, `median` is `b[ma] - 2`, `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]`**

This ensures that `new_median` (which is `b[ma]`) is greater than `median` (which is `b[ma] - 2`), thus satisfying the loop condition `new_median <= median` for one more iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer that is less than or equal to 10000, `case` is an input string, `op` is 2, `b` is the sorted list of integers derived from `a` with the element at index `ma` incremented by 2, `ma` is calculated as `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, or `(num2 - 1) // 2` if `num2` is odd, `median` is `b[ma] - 2`, `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]`**
