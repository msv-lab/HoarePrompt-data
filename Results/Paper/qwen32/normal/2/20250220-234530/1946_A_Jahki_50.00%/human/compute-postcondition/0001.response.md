In the given task, the for loop iterates from 0 to `num - 1`. The variables in the loop head are `i` and `num`. To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on these two variables.

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `num` is greater than 0 because `range(0, num)` generates numbers from 0 up to `num - 1`.
- The variable `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts and is controlled by the `range` function, so we don't need to set it manually before the loop begins.

### Required Adjustments:
- `num` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop executes at least once.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `num` must be greater than 0**
