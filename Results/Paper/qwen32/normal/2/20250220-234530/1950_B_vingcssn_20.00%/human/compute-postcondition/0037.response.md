Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, `casos` is equal to `t`, `c` is 1, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is equal to 1, then `n` remains 1. If `n` is equal to 2, 3, or 4, then `n` remains unchanged. If `n` is not equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4, then `n` could be any other integer.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the input. The values of `t`, `casos`, and `c` remain unchanged.
