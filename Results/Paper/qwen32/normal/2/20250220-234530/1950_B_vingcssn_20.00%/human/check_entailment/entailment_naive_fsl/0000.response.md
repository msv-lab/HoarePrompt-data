Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program only handles specific cases for `n` equal to 1, 2, 3, and 4. It does not handle any other values of `n` within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). For example, if `n` is 5, the program will output "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the corresponding 10x10 checkerboard pattern. Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases as required by the problem description.
