Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- `casos` is set to the value of `t`.
- `c` is set to 2.
- `n` is an integer provided by the user input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('..##..##')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet directly outputs the string `'..##..##'`. This string does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `casos`, `c`, or `n`. Therefore, the output will always be the same regardless of the values of these variables.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'..##..##'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **..##..##**
