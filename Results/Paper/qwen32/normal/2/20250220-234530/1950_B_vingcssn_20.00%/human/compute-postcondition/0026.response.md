The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print('##..##..')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'##..##..'` without referencing any variables or conditions. The initial state provides details about variables `t`, `casos`, `c`, and `n`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'##..##..'`.

Output: **##..##..**
