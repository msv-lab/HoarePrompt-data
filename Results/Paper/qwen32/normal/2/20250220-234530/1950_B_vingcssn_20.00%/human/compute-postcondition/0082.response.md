In this task, the initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `casos`, `c`, and `n`), but the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables. Instead, it directly prints the string `'##..##..'`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- `casos` is set to the value of `t`.
- `c` is set to 2.
- `n` is an integer provided by the user input.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will simply be the string `'##..##..'`.

Output: **##..##..**
