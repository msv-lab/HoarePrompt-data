Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, `casos` is equal to `t`, `c` is initialized to 0, `n` is an input integer, `n` is not equal to 1. If `n` is 2, the current value of `n` remains 2. If `n` is 3, the current value of `n` remains 3. If `n` is 4, the current value of `n` remains 4. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4 and could be any other integer.**
