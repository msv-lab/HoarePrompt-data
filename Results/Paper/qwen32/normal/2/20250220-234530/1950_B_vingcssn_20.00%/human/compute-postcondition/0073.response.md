In this task, we need to determine the output of the `print` statement given the initial state of the program. Let's analyze the provided information:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- `casos` is equal to `t`.
- `c` is set to 2.
- `n` is an integer provided by the user input.

However, the `print` statement in the code snippet does not reference any of these variables (`t`, `casos`, `c`, `n`). Instead, it directly prints the string `'..##..'`.

Given this, the output will simply be the string `'..##..'`.

Output: **..##..**
