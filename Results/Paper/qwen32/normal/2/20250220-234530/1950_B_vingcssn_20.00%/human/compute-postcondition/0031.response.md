Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- `casos` is set to the value of `t`.
- `c` is initialized to 0.
- `n` is an input integer, and it is explicitly stated that `n` is not equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4.

The provided code snippet is:
```python
print('No esta en el rango')
```

This print statement outputs a fixed string, regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `casos`, `c`, and `n`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply the string `'No esta en el rango'`.

Output: **No esta en el rango**
