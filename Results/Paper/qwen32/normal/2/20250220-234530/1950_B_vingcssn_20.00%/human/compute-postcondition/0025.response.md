Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- `casos` is set to the value of `t`.
- `c` is initialized to 0.
- `n` is an input integer with specific constraints: `n` is not equal to 1, `n` is not equal to 2, `n` is not equal to 3, and the current value of `n` is 4.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('..##..##')
```

### Explanation:
The print statement simply outputs the string `'..##..##'`. This string does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `casos`, `c`, or `n`. It is a static string literal.

### Final Output:
Based on the analysis, the output of the print statement is the string `'..##..##'`.

Output: **..##..##**
