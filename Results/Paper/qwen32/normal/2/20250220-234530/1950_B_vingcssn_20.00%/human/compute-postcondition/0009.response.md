The given initial state describes several variables and their properties, but the `print` statement in the code snippet does not depend on any of these variables. It simply prints the string `'##..'`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 20.
- `casos` is set to the value of `t`.
- `c` is initialized to 0.
- `n` is an input integer that is not equal to 1, and currently, `n` is 2.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is hardcoded to output the string `'##..'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **##..**
