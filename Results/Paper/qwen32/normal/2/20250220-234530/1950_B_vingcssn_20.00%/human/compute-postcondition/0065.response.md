Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
  - `casos` is set to the value of `t`.
  - `c` is set to 2.
  - `n` is the integer provided by the user input.

- **Code Snippet:**
  ```python
  print('##')
  ```

The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables (`t`, `casos`, `c`, `n`) mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'##'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **##**
