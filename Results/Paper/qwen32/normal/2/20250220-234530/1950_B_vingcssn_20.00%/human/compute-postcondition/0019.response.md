The `print` statement in the given Python code snippet is:

```python
print('##..##')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'##..##'`. None of the variables (`t`, `casos`, `c`, `n`) are used within this particular `print` statement, so their values do not affect the output.

Based on the initial state provided, the variables have the following characteristics:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 20.
- `casos` is set to the value of `t`.
- `c` is initialized to 0.
- `n` is an input integer that is neither 1 nor 2, and currently has the value 3.

However, these details do not influence the output of the `print` statement because it explicitly prints the string `'##..##'`.

Output: **##..##**
