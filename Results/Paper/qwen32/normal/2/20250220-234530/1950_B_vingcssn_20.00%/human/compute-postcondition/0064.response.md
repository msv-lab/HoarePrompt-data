The code snippet `n = int(input())` reassigns the value of `n` based on the user's input. The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer, and its value is dependent on the conditions given (1, 2, 3, 4, or any other integer). After executing this line, `n` will take the value of whatever integer is provided by the user input.

The values of `t`, `casos`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, `casos` is equal to `t`, `c` is 2, and `n` is the integer provided by the user input.**
