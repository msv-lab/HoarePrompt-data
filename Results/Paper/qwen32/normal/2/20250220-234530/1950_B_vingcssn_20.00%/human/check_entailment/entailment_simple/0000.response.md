### Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by handling specific cases for `n` from 1 to 4. However, it does not provide a general solution for any value of `n` within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). The code explicitly checks for values of `n` up to 4 and prints the corresponding patterns. For values of `n` greater than 4, it outputs "No esta en el rango" (which translates to "Not in the range"), which is not the expected behavior according to the problem description.

The correct approach would involve generating the pattern dynamically for any given `n`. Here's a brief outline of how the correct solution should work:

1. For a given `n`, the size of the checkerboard will be `2n x 2n`.
2. The pattern alternates between `'#'` and `'.'` in blocks of `2x2`.
3. The top-left cell should always be `'#'`.

To generate the pattern dynamically, we can use nested loops to iterate over the rows and columns, determining whether to print `'#'` or `'.'` based on the current position.

Since the provided code does not handle all possible values of `n` correctly, it is not a complete or correct solution.
