The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 676, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` and `k` are integers between 1 and 26. After executing the code snippet, the values of `n` and `k` will be updated to the values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 676, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26.**
