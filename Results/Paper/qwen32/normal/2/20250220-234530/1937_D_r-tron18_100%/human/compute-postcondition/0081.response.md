Postcondition: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`; `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not; `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not); `suffZero` is updated to include the new value `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and other variables; `el` is the character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are determined based on the conditions involving `zr`, `ol`, and other variables; `fi` is a value derived from `preOne` and `zr` when `el` is '>', `i` is 0; `i` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. Specifically, if `zr <= ol`, then `ans[i]` is `(suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]) - (2 * func_1(preOne, zr)) + n + 1`, with `zeroInd` being `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` and `oneInd` being `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`, with `zeroInd` being `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` and `oneInd` being `2 * preOne[-1]`.**
