The code snippet calculates `zeroInd` by summing the last two elements of the `suffZero` list. Given the initial state, `suffZero` is `[0, i + 1]`. Therefore, `zeroInd` will be `0 + (i + 1)`, which simplifies to `i + 1`.

No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`, `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning, `suffZero` is `[0, i + 1]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `el` is a character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>', `el` is not '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is 1, and `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, `zeroInd` is `i + 1`.**
