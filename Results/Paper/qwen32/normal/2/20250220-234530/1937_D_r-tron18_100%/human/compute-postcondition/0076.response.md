To determine the output state, we need to focus on the given line of code and how it affects the variables:

```
oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
```

This line sets `oneInd` to twice the result of the function `func_1` called with arguments `preOne` and `zr`. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this line.

Since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we can only express `oneInd` in terms of `func_1(preOne, zr)`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`; `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not; `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not); `suffZero` is updated to include the new value `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and other variables; `el` is the character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are determined based on the conditions involving `zr`, `ol`, and other variables; `fi` is a value derived from `preOne` and `zr` when `el` is '>', `i` is 0; `i` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`; `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`**.
