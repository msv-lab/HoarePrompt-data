To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and see how it affects the variables:

```
zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
```

This line calculates the value of `zeroInd` using the function `func_1`. Since `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `zeroInd`. However, we can express `zeroInd` in terms of `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` and `func_1(suffZero, 1)`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `zeroInd`. All other variables retain their previous values unless explicitly modified in the code snippet.

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`; `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not; `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not); `suffZero` is updated to include the new value `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and other variables; `el` is the character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`; `oneInd` is determined based on the conditions involving `zr`, `ol`, and other variables; `fi` is a value derived from `preOne` and `zr` when `el` is '>', `i` is 0; `i` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**
