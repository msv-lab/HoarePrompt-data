The given code snippet modifies the value of `ans[i]` based on several variables. Let's determine the new state of the variables after the execution of the code.

The line `ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` updates the value of `ans[i]`. Given the initial state, we know the following:

- `zeroInd` is `i + 1`
- `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`

Thus, the value of `ans[i]` becomes:
\[ \text{ans}[i] = (i + 1) - (2 \times \text{func\_1}(\text{preOne}, zr)) + n + 1 \]

Simplifying, we get:
\[ \text{ans}[i] = i + 2 + n - 2 \times \text{func\_1}(\text{preOne}, zr) \]

Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot simplify further without knowing its behavior. However, we can express the final value of `ans[i]` in terms of the known expressions.

Other variables (`s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`; `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`; `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning; `suffZero` is `[0, i + 1]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is `i + 2 + n - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`; `el` is a character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>', and `el` is not '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is 1, and `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`; `zeroInd` is `i + 1`; `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`**
