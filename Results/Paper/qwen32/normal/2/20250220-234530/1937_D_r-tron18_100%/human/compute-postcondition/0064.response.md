Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's determine the new output state.

The code snippet modifies the `ans` list at index `i` by setting it to the difference between `zeroInd` and `oneInd`. Here are the relevant variables and their relationships:

- `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.
- `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we'll keep these expressions as they are. However, we know the values of `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are used to compute `ans[i]`.

Thus, the only variable that changes is `ans[i]`, which is set to `zeroInd - oneInd`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`; `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not; `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not); `suffZero` is `[0]` or `[0, i + 1]` depending on whether `el` is '>' or not; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol) - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `suffZero` has length 1 or 2; `el` is the character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>'; `i` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`; `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`**.

In simpler terms, the value of `ans[i]` is updated to the difference between `zeroInd` and `oneInd`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
