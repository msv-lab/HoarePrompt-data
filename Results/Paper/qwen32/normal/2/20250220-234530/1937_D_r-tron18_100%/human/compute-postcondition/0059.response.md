The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, and now we need to adjust it to the value it would have at the start of the next iteration.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

If `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k - 1`.

Let's determine the new state:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k`.
2. For the next iteration, `i` should be `k - 1`.

Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this decrement.

Therefore, if `i` was `0` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop would terminate because the next value of `i` would be `-1`, which is outside the range. Otherwise, `i` should simply be decremented by 1.

Assuming `i` was not `0` at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`; `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not; `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not); `suffZero` is `[0]` or `[0, i + 1]` depending on whether `el` is '>' or not; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and other variables. If `el` is '>', `ans[i]` is calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd` if `ol <= zr`, otherwise `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. If `el` is '<', `ans[0]` is `2 - (2 * func_1(preOne, zr)) + n` if `zr <= ol`, otherwise `ans[0]` is `-1 - 2 * preOne[-1]` if `totalOne` is 1; `el` is the character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>'; `ol` is `totalOne` or `totalOne + 1` depending on whether `el` is '>' or not; `zr` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `el` is '>' or not; `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are determined based on the conditions involving `zr`, `ol`, and other variables; `fi` is a value derived from `preOne` and `zr` when `el` is '>', `i` is 0; `i` is `k - 1` where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.**

However, since we don't know the exact value of `k` (the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration), we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`; `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not; `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not); `suffZero` is `[0]` or `[0, i + 1]` depending on whether `el` is '>' or not; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and other variables. If `el` is '>', `ans[i]` is calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd` if `ol <= zr`, otherwise `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. If `el` is '<', `ans[0]` is `2 - (2 * func_1(preOne, zr)) + n` if `zr <= ol`, otherwise `ans[0]` is `-1 - 2 * preOne[-1]` if `totalOne` is 1; `el` is the character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>'; `ol` is `totalOne` or `totalOne + 1` depending on whether `el` is '>' or not; `zr` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `el` is '>' or not; `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are determined based on the conditions involving `zr`, `ol`, and other variables; `fi` is a value derived from `preOne` and `zr` when `el` is '>', `i` is 0; `i` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**
