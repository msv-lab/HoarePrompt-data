To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, we need to analyze the initial state provided. However, the initial state does not specify any details about the variable `ans`. Without knowing what `ans` contains, it's impossible to determine the exact output.

Given this situation, we can only describe the output in terms of the contents of `ans`.

Explanation:
- The `*` operator in the `print(*ans)` statement unpacks the elements of the iterable `ans` and prints them separated by spaces.
- Since the initial state does not provide any information about `ans`, we cannot specify the exact values that will be printed.

Therefore, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **the elements of ans separated by spaces (where ans is an iterable containing the values to be printed)**
