Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, we need to determine the new state after executing the line `ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd`.

Here's the breakdown:

- `ans[i]` is being assigned the value of `zeroInd - oneInd`.
- `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`.
- `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * preOne[-1]`.

Since the exact values of `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` and `func_1(suffZero, 1)` are not specified, we will represent `zeroInd` and `oneInd` using these expressions.

After the assignment, `ans[i]` will hold the value `zeroInd - oneInd`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`, `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning, `suffZero` is `[0, i + 1]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1) - 2 * preOne[-1]`, `el` is a character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>', and `el` is not '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is 1, and `zr` is greater than `ol`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`.**

In simpler terms, the value at `ans[i]` is updated to be the difference between `zeroInd` and `oneInd`, while all other variables retain their original values.
