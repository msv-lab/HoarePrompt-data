Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a non-negative integer representing the length of the string `s1` such that `n = len(s1)`; `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`; `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning; `suffZero` is `[0]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    el = s1[i]
    if el == '>':
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if ol <= zr:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
            oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
            oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
            fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
        preOne.pop()
        totalOne -= 1
    else:
        suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if zr <= ol:
            zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
            oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`, `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not), `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not), `suffZero` is `[0]` or `[0, i + 1]` depending on whether `el` is '>' or not, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and other variables, `el` is a character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>', `ol` is `totalOne` or `totalOne + 1` depending on whether `el` is '>' or not, `zr` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `el` is '>' or not, `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are determined based on the conditions involving `zr`, `ol`, and other variables, and `fi` is a value derived from `preOne` and `zr` when `el` is '>'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`; `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not; `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not); `suffZero` is `[0]` or `[0, i + 1]` depending on whether `el` is '>' or not; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and other variables. If `el` is '>', `ans[i]` is calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd` if `ol <= zr`, otherwise `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. If `el` is '<', `ans[0]` is `2 - (2 * func_1(preOne, zr)) + n` if `zr <= ol`, otherwise `ans[0]` is `-1 - 2 * preOne[-1]` if `totalOne` is 1; `el` is the character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>'; `ol` is `totalOne` or `totalOne + 1` depending on whether `el` is '>' or not; `zr` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `el` is '>' or not; `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are determined based on the conditions involving `zr`, `ol`, and other variables; `fi` is a value derived from `preOne` and `zr` when `el` is '>', `i` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`; `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not; `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not); `suffZero` is `[0]` or `[0, i + 1]` depending on whether `el` is '>' or not; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and other variables. If `el` is '>', `ans[i]` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol) - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))` if `ol <= zr`, otherwise `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. If `el` is '<', `ans[i]` is `(suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]) - (2 * func_1(preOne, zr)) + n + 1` if `zr <= ol`, otherwise `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`. Here, `ol` is `totalOne` or `totalOne + 1` depending on whether `el` is '>' or not; `zr` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `suffZero` has length 1 or 2; `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are determined based on the conditions involving `zr`, `ol`, and other variables; `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol > zr`; `i` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
