To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

Given:
- `s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`.
- `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not).
- `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not).
- `suffZero` is `[0, 1]`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and other variables.
- `el` is the character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>'.
- `ol` is `totalOne`.
- `zr` is 1.
- `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are determined based on the conditions involving `zr`, `ol`, and other variables.
- `fi` is a value derived from `preOne` and `zr` when `el` is '>', `i` is 0; `el` is the first character of `s1`.

The code snippet:
```python
zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
```

Let's assume `func_1` is a function that takes two arguments, a list and an integer, and returns an integer value. Since the exact definition of `func_1` is not provided, we'll assume it operates on the list `suffZero` and the integer arguments passed to it.

Given `suffZero` is `[0, 1]`, let's consider possible outcomes of `func_1`:

1. `func_1([0, 1], ol + 1)`:
   - If `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, then `ol + 1` is one more than the number of '>' characters.
   - Assuming `func_1` returns the value at the index specified by the second argument in the list (if within bounds), or a default value otherwise, we need to consider the possible values.

2. `func_1([0, 1], 1)`:
   - This would return the value at index 1 in `suffZero`, which is `1`.

Since `suffZero` only has two elements `[0, 1]`, `func_1([0, 1], ol + 1)` would depend on the value of `ol`. If `ol` is 0, then `ol + 1` is 1, and `func_1([0, 1], 1)` would be `1`. If `ol` is 1, then `ol + 1` is 2, and `func_1([0, 1], 2)` would likely be out of bounds and could return a default value, possibly `0`.

For simplicity, let's assume `func_1` returns the value at the index if within bounds, otherwise `0`.

Thus:
- If `ol` is 0, `func_1([0, 1], ol + 1)` is `1` and `func_1([0, 1], 1)` is `1`, so `zeroInd = 2 * 1 - 1 = 1`.
- If `ol` is 1, `func_1([0, 1], ol + 1)` is `0` and `func_1([0, 1], 1)` is `1`, so `zeroInd = 2 * 0 - 1 = -1`.

However, since `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` and `s1` consists of '<' and '>', `ol` must be a non-negative integer. Given the context, let's assume `ol` is at least 1 (since `n >= 1` and there must be at least one character).

Therefore, `zeroInd` would be `-1` if `ol` is 1.

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`, `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not), `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not), `suffZero` is `[0, 1]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and other variables, `el` is the character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is 1, `zeroInd` is `-1` if `ol` is 1, `oneInd` is determined based on the conditions involving `zr`, `ol`, and other variables, and `fi` is a value derived from `preOne` and `zr` when `el` is '>', `i` is 0; `el` is the first character of `s1`.**
