You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers representing cumulative times at which the pinball would leave the grid from certain positions, and times is an integer representing the offset used to determine the starting point for calculating the difference in times.
def func_1(arr, times):

#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the difference between the last element of the list `arr` and the element at the index determined by `max(-n, -1 - times)`, where `n` is the length of `arr`. This effectively computes the difference between the last cumulative time and a previous cumulative time based on the offset `times`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the movement of the pinball as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not account for the inversion of the character after the pinball moves, which is a critical part of the problem's rules.

Let's consider a simple test case to illustrate this issue:

### Test Case:
```
1
3
><>
```

### Expected Output:
```
2 1 2
```

### Explanation of Expected Output:
- For `i=1` (pinball starts at the first cell): Pinball moves right to the second cell (time = 1), inverts `>` to `<`, then moves left to the first cell (time = 2), inverts `<` to `>`, and finally moves left out of the grid (time = 3).
- For `i=2` (pinball starts at the second cell): Pinball moves right to the third cell (time = 1), inverts `<` to `>`, then moves right out of the grid (time = 2).
- For `i=3` (pinball starts at the third cell): Pinball moves left to the second cell (time = 1), inverts `>` to `<`, then moves left to the first cell (time = 2), inverts `<` to `>`, and finally moves left out of the grid (time = 3).

However, the provided program does not handle the inversion of characters correctly and thus would likely produce incorrect results for this and other similar test cases.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not correctly simulate the pinball movement and character inversion as per the problem description, it is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
