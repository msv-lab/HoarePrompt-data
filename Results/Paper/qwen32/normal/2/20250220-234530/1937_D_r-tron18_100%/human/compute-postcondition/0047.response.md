The code snippet `preOne.pop()` removes the last element from the list `preOne`. This affects the length and contents of `preOne` but does not affect other variables unless they are directly dependent on the value of the removed element.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `preOne`, which now has one less element. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`; `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not); `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not), with the last element removed; `suffZero` is `[0]` or `[0, i + 1]` depending on whether `el` is '>' or not; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined as follows: if `ol <= zr`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`; otherwise, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`; `el` is the character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `suffZero` is `[0]` or `[0, i + 1]`; `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)` if `ol <= zr`, otherwise `zeroInd` is `0` or `2 * (i + 1)`; `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` if `ol <= zr`, otherwise `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 0)` if `zr` is `0`, otherwise `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 2)`; `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol > zr`, otherwise `fi` is a value derived from `preOne` and `zr` when `el` is '>', `i` is 0.**
