To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
```

This line of code calculates the value of `oneInd` by calling a function `func_1` with `preOne` and `zr` as arguments, and then multiplying the result by 2.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`.
- `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning.
- `suffZero` is `[0, i + 1]`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `el` is a character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>', and `el` is not '>'.
- `ol` is `totalOne`.
- `zr` is 1, and `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`.
- `zeroInd` is `i + 1`.

Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot compute its exact return value. However, we can denote the result of `func_1(preOne, zr)` as `result_func_1`. Therefore, `oneInd` will be `2 * result_func_1`.

The output state will include the new value of `oneInd` and retain all other variables with their original values unless they are explicitly changed by the code.

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`; `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`; `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning; `suffZero` is `[0, i + 1]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros; `el` is a character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>', and `el` is not '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is 1, and `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`; `zeroInd` is `i + 1`; `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`**.
