To determine the new state after executing the given line of code, let's analyze the impact on the variables.

The line of code is:
```python
oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
```

This line modifies the value of `oneInd` by subtracting the result of `func_1(preOne, 1)` from its current value.

Given the initial state, `oneInd` is calculated as:
```python
oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
```

After executing the line `oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)`, the new value of `oneInd` will be:
```python
oneInd = (func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)) - func_1(preOne, 1)
```

Since `zr` is either 0 or 1, we need to consider both cases:

1. If `zr` is 0:
   ```python
   oneInd = (func_1(preOne, 0) + func_1(preOne, 1)) - func_1(preOne, 1) = func_1(preOne, 0)
   ```

2. If `zr` is 1:
   ```python
   oneInd = (func_1(preOne, 1) + func_1(preOne, 2)) - func_1(preOne, 1) = func_1(preOne, 2)
   ```

Thus, the new value of `oneInd` depends on the value of `zr`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`; `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not); `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not); `suffZero` is `[0]` or `[0, i + 1]` depending on whether `el` is '>' or not; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and other variables; `el` is the character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `suffZero` is `[0]` or `[0, i + 1]`; `zeroInd` is `0` or `2 * (i + 1)` based on `suffZero`; `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 0)` if `zr` is 0, otherwise `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 2)`; `fi` is a value derived from `preOne` and `zr` when `el` is '>', `i` is 0; `el` is the first character of `s1`.**
