Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `l` and `r` are integers with `l` possibly equal to `r`, and `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`. If `k` ≥ `a[l] * 2`, then `sunks` is increased by 1, `l` is incremented by 1, and if `a[r]` is 0, `r` is decremented by 1 and `sunks` is set to either 1 or 2. If `k` < `a[l] * 2`, then if `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k` and `l` equals `r` and `k` ≥ `a[r]`, `sunks` is set to 1; otherwise, `sunks` remains 0. If `l` is not equal to `r`, no changes are made to `sunks`.**
