Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15 (unless k has been modified to 0), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. `k` is now `k - a[l] * 2`. If `l` equals `r`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The value of `k` has been updated to `k - a[l] * 2`. All other conditions and variable constraints remain the same.
