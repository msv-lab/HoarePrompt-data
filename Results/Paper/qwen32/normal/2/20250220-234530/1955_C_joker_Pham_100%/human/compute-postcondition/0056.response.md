To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition `l <= r`.

Given the loop condition `while l <= r:`, the loop will continue as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to ensure that `l` remains less than or equal to `r`.

Here's the analysis:

- The variables `l` and `r` are the only ones that affect the loop condition.
- If `l` is currently greater than `r`, the loop will terminate, so we need to adjust `l` and/or `r` to ensure `l <= r`.
- If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop will continue, and no adjustment is needed.

Since the problem specifies that `l` and `r` are integers and `l` could possibly equal `r`, we need to ensure that `l` is not incremented beyond `r` and `r` is not decremented below `l` in such a way that `l` becomes greater than `r`.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure `l` is still less than or equal to `r`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `l` and `r` are integers with `l` must be less than or equal to `r`.**
