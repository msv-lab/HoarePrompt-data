The value of `l` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `l` and `r` are integers with `l` possibly equal to `r`. Additionally, `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`. The values of `l`, `r`, and `a[r]` remain unchanged except `l` is now `l + 1`. The current value of `k` is `k - a[r] * 2`. `a[l]` is now 0. `sunks` is incremented by 1.**
