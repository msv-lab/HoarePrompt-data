Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `l` and `r` are integers with `l` possibly equal to `r`. If `k` is 0, no changes are made to `sunks`, `l`, or `r`, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `sunks`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged based on the conditions specified in the problem statement.**
