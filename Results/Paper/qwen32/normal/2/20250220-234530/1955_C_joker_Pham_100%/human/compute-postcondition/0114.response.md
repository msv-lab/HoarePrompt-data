Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15 (unless k has been modified to 0), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 (with `a[r]` potentially updated), `l` is incremented by 1 if `k >= a[l] * 2`, and `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. If `k >= a[l] * 2`, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]` and `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `k < a[l] * 2`, the loop breaks, and if `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. In either case, if `l` equals `r`, the loop breaks.**
