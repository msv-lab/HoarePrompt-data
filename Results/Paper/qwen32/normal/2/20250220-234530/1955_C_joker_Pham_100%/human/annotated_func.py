#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    return sunks
    #The program returns the total number of successful sink operations, which is represented by the variable `sunks`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes an integer `n`, a long integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It performs operations to determine the maximum number of "sink" operations that can be performed given the constraints, where a "sink" operation involves reducing elements in the list based on the value of `k`. The function returns the total count of these successful sink operations.
