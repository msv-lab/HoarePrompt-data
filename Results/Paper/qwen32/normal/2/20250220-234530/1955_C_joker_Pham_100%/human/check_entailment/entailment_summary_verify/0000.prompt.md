You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes an integer `n`, a long integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It performs operations to determine the maximum number of "sink" operations that can be performed given the constraints, where a "sink" operation involves reducing elements in the list based on the value of `k`. The function returns the total count of these successful sink operations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it does not account for scenarios where the Kraken's attacks can be evenly distributed between the first and last ships without fully sinking either before moving to the next pair.

Let's consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
4 6
1 2 4 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
1. Attack 1: First ship (durability 1) -> Sinks. Remaining ships: [2, 4, 3].
2. Attack 2: Last ship (durability 3) -> Durability becomes 2. Remaining ships: [2, 4, 2].
3. Attack 3: First ship (durability 2) -> Sinks. Remaining ships: [4, 2].
4. Attack 4: Last ship (durability 2) -> Sinks. Remaining ships: [4].
5. Attack 5: First ship (durability 4) -> Durability becomes 3. Remaining ships: [3].
6. Attack 6: Last ship (durability 3) -> Durability becomes 2. Remaining ships: [2].

In this case, the program should output `3` because three ships have sunk. However, the provided program might incorrectly handle this scenario due to its logic of checking and breaking out of the loop prematurely.

To further illustrate, let's look at another problematic case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
3 4
1 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
1. Attack 1: First ship (durability 1) -> Sinks. Remaining ships: [2, 1].
2. Attack 2: Last ship (durability 1) -> Sinks. Remaining ships: [2].
3. Attack 3: First ship (durability 2) -> Durability becomes 1. Remaining ships: [1].
4. Attack 4: Last ship (durability 1) -> Sinks. Remaining ships: [].

Here, the program should output `3` because all three ships have sunk. However, the current implementation may not correctly account for the decrementing of durability and the subsequent sinking of ships in this alternating pattern.

Thus, the provided program does not correctly handle all edge cases and therefore is incorrect.
