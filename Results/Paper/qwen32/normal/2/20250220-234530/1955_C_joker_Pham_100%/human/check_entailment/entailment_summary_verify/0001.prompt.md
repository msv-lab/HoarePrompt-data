You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes an integer `n`, a long integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It performs operations to determine the maximum number of "sink" operations that can be performed given the constraints, where a "sink" operation involves reducing elements in the list based on the value of `k`. The function returns the total count of these successful sink operations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of ships), `k` (number of attacks), and the list `a` of ship durabilities.
   - It then calls `func_1(n, k, a)` to compute the number of ships sunk.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Initializes pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the list, respectively.
   - Initializes `sunks` to count the number of ships sunk.
   - Enters a loop that continues as long as `l <= r` and `k > 0`.

3. **Handling Attacks**:
   - If `l == r`, it means there's only one ship left. It checks if the remaining attacks `k` are enough to sink this ship (`k >= a[r]`). If yes, it increments `sunks` and breaks the loop.
   - If `a[l] <= a[r]`, it checks if the remaining attacks `k` are enough to sink both the first and last ships (`k >= a[l] * 2`). If yes, it updates `k` by subtracting `a[l] * 2`, adjusts the durability of the last ship, and updates `l` and `r` accordingly. If the last ship's durability drops to zero, it increments `sunks` and decrements `r`. It also increments `sunks` for the first ship and increments `l`.
   - If `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`, it means exactly one more attack is needed to sink the first ship, so it increments `sunks` and breaks the loop.
   - If neither condition is met, it breaks the loop.
   - Similar logic applies when `a[r] < a[l]`, but with roles of the first and last ships swapped.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles scenarios where `k` is insufficient to sink any more ships.
   - It also handles the scenario where `l == r` correctly.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Attacks**:
   - The function does not handle the case where `k` is large enough to sink multiple ships but not exactly enough to sink the first or last ship completely. For example, if `a[l] = 3` and `k = 5`, the function should decrement `a[l]` by 3 (sink the first ship) and then decrement `a[r]` by 2 (sink part of the last ship), but it does not do this correctly.

2. **Inefficient Use of Attacks**:
   - The function does not optimally use the remaining attacks `k`. It should consider sinking as many ships as possible with the available attacks, rather than breaking early when `k` is not exactly enough to sink a ship completely.

### Conclusion

Given the identified issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
