Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15 (unless k has been modified to 0), `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]` and each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 (except for `a[r]` which has been updated), `l` is incremented by 1, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`, `sunks` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Thus, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, and `sunks` remain as specified in the initial state, except that `l` and `sunks` have already been incremented by 1 as part of the operations described before the `continue` statement.
