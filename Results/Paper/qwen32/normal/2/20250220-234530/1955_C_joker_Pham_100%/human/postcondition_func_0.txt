The function `func_1` takes an integer `n`, a long integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It performs operations to determine the maximum number of "sink" operations that can be performed given the constraints, where a "sink" operation involves reducing elements in the list based on the value of `k`. The function returns the total count of these successful sink operations.
