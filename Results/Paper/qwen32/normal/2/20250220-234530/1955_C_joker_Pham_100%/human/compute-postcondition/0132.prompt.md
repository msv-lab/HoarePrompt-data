Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; l is 0, r is n - 1; sunks is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l <= r:
    if k == 0:
        break
    if l == r:
        if k >= a[r]:
            sunks += 1
            break
        break
    if a[l] <= a[r]:
        if k >= a[l] * 2:
            k -= a[l] * 2
            a[r] -= a[l]
            if a[r] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                r -= 1
            sunks += 1
            l += 1
            continue
        elif a[l] * 2 - 1 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break
    if k == 0:
        break
    if a[r] < a[l]:
        if k >= a[r] * 2:
            k -= a[r] * 2
            a[l] -= a[r]
            if a[l] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                l += 1
            sunks += 1
            r -= 1
            continue
        elif a[r] * 2 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `l` and `r` are integers with `l` possibly equal to `r`. If `a[r] < a[l]`, and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`, then `k` is reduced by `a[r] * 2`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, `a[l]` is set to 0 if it was initially greater than 0, `l` is incremented by 1, and `r` is decremented by 1. If `k` is exactly equal to `a[r] * 2`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `k` is less than `a[r] * 2`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged. If `a[r] >= a[l]`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15 (unless k has been modified to 0), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `l` and `r` are integers with `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k >= a[r] * 2`, then `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r]`, `r` is now `r - 1`, `k` is now `k - 2 * a[r]`, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `a[r] * 2 == k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1 without modifying `a`, `l`, `r`, or `k`. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k < a[r] * 2`, no changes are made to the variables. If `a[r] >= a[l]`, no changes are made to the variables.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15 (unless k has been modified to 0), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 (with `a[r]` potentially updated). If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k >= a[r] * 2`, then `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]` and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k < a[r] * 2`, then the loop breaks without modifying `l`, `r`, `a`, `k`, or `sunks` further. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `a[r] * 2 == k`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[r] >= a[l]`, no changes are made to `l`, `r`, `a`, `k`, or `sunks`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
