Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `l` and `r` are integers with `l` possibly equal to `r`. Additionally, `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`. The current value of `k` is `k - a[r] * 2`. If `a[l]` was initially greater than 0, `a[l]` is now 0, `l` is incremented by 1, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[l]` was initially 0, `l` and `a[r]` remain unchanged. `sunks` is incremented by 1. `r` is decremented by 1. The code continues to the next iteration of the loop.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `a[r] * 2` from it. If `a[l]` was greater than 0, it is set to 0, `l` is incremented by 1, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[l]` was already 0, `l` and `a[r]` remain unchanged, but `sunks` is still incremented by 1. `r` is decremented by 1. The code then continues to the next iteration of the loop without making any further changes to the other variables.
