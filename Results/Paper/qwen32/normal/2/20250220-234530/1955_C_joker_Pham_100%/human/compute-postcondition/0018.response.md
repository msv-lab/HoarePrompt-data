Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k - a[l] * 2 ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `l` and `r` are integers with `l` possibly equal to `r`, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, and `a[r]` is now 0. `sunks` is either 1 or 2 depending on the initial conditions.**

Explanation: The value of `sunks` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values except for `a[r]`, which has been updated to 0.
