Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ \(10^{18}\). If `n` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `n` or `k`. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `n` or `k` if `n` equals `k`. Otherwise, if `n` is not equal to `k`, `k - 1` is compared to `n - k + 1`; no specific change is indicated based on this comparison alone.**
