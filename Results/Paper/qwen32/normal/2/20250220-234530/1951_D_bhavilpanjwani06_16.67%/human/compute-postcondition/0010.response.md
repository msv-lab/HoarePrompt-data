Given the initial state, let's break down the information provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `n` and `k` are positive integers with `1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18`.
- `n` is not equal to `k`.
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- The condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` is satisfied.

The Python code snippet contains only one line:
```python
print('YES')
```

This line simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`, the output will always be the same regardless of the specific values of these variables, as long as they satisfy the given conditions.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **YES**
