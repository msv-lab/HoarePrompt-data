The given code snippet calculates `mod_y` using the expression `mod_y = num % y`. However, there is a discrepancy because `num` is not defined in the initial state. Based on the context, it seems like `num` should be `n` since `n` is used in a similar manner earlier in the description (`mod_x = n % x`). Assuming `num` is meant to be `n`, here's the output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is a list containing `beautiful_count`, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first three elements of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0, `mod_x` is `n % x`, `mod_y` is `n % y`**

In natural language: The variable `mod_y` is now calculated as `n % y`. All other variables retain their initial values.
