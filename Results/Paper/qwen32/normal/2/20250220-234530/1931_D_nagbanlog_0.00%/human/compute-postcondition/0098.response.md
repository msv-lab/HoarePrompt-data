The given code calculates `required_mod_x` based on the current values of `n` and `x`. Specifically, `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`, where `mod_x` is `n % x`.

Given the initial state, `mod_x` is already defined as `n % x`. The new variable `required_mod_x` is derived from this.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `test_cases` remains a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a).
- `results` remains a list containing the final `beautiful_count` for the current test case.
- `case` remains the next test case in `test_cases`.
- `n` remains the first element of `case['params']`.
- `x` remains the second element of `case['params']`.
- `y` remains the third element of `case['params']`.
- `a` remains `case['array']` and must have at least one element.
- `freq` remains an empty dictionary.
- `beautiful_count` remains 0.
- `mod_x` remains `n % x`.
- `mod_y` remains `n % y`.
- `required_mod_x` is now `(x - mod_x) % x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is a list containing the final `beautiful_count` for the current test case, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0, `mod_x` is `n % x`, `mod_y` is `n % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.**
