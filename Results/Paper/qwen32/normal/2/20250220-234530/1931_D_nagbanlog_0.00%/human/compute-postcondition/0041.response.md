The code snippet provided increments the count of the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the dictionary `freq` by 1. This means that the frequency of the pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` in `freq` will increase by one.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `test_cases` remains a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a).
- `results` remains an empty list.
- `n`, `x`, and `y` remain the values extracted from `case['params']`.
- `a` remains the list of integers from `case['array']`.
- `num` remains the next element in the list `a`.
- `mod_x` remains `num % x`.
- `mod_y` remains `num % y`.
- `required_mod_x` remains `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `required_mod_y` remains `mod_y`.
- `beautiful_count` remains unchanged unless the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` was already in `freq`.
- `freq` now has the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the values extracted from `case['params']`, `a` is the list of integers from `case['array']`, `num` is the next element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.**
