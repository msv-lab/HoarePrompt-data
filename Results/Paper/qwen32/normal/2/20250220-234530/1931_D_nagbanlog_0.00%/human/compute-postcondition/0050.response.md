To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **t**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This represents the number of test cases.
2. **test_cases**: A list containing at least one test case. Each test case is a tuple \((n, x, y, a)\).
3. **results**: A list that will store the results of each test case, specifically `beautiful_count`.
4. **case**: The next test case in `test_cases`. This is a tuple containing four elements: \(n\), \(x\), \(y\), and \(a\).
5. **n, x, y**: The first three elements of `case['params']`. However, based on the provided initial state, it seems more likely that `n`, `x`, and `y` are directly unpacked from the tuple `case` rather than being part of a dictionary with key `'params'`.
6. **a**: The fourth element of `case`, which is an array.
7. **freq**: An empty dictionary that will presumably be used to keep track of frequencies of elements.
8. **beautiful_count**: An integer initialized to 0, which will count the number of "beautiful" elements in the array.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
```

We need to determine the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` based on the initial state. Since `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, and each test case is a tuple \((n, x, y, a)\), we can infer that:
- `n` is the first element of `case`.
- `x` is the second element of `case`.
- `y` is the third element of `case`.
- `a` is the fourth element of `case`.

However, the exact values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` are not explicitly provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a] (where n, x, y, and a are the elements of the current test case in test_cases)**
