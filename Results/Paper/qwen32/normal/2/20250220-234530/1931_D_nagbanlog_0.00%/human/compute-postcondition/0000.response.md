Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three integers n, x, and y where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and a list of n integers a where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No other variables are affected, and the preconditions remain unchanged.
