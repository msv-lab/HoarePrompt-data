To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's break down the variables and their values based on the initial state:

1. **`num`**: This is the next element in the list `a`, which is part of the current test case `case`. Since the exact value of `num` is not specified, we'll denote it as `num`.

2. **`mod_x`**: This is calculated as `num % x`. Given that `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, we denote `x` as `x` and `mod_x` as `num % x`.

3. **`mod_y`**: This is calculated as `num % y`. Given that `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, we denote `y` as `y` and `mod_y` as `num % y`.

4. **`required_mod_x`**: This is calculated as `(x - (num % x)) % x`, which simplifies to `(x - mod_x) % x`. So, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.

5. **`required_mod_y`**: This is simply `mod_y`.

Given these definitions, the `print` statement will output the following formatted string:

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [num % x], mod_y: [num % y], required_mod_x: [(x - (num % x)) % x], required_mod_y: [num % y] (where num is the current number from the array a, x and y are parameters from the current test case)**

To make it more precise and clear:

- `[num]` represents the current number being processed from the array `a`.
- `[num % x]` represents the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
- `[num % y]` represents the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
- `[(x - (num % x)) % x]` represents the required adjustment to `num` to make it divisible by `x` without affecting its divisibility by `y`.

So, the final output is:

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [num % x], mod_y: [num % y], required_mod_x: [(x - (num % x)) % x], required_mod_y: [num % y]**
