Let's analyze the provided program to see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find pairs \((i, j)\) such that:
- \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
- \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

### Key Observations:
1. For \(a_i + a_j\) to be divisible by \(x\), we need:
   \[
   (a_i \mod x) + (a_j \mod x) \equiv 0 \pmod{x}
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   (a_i \mod x) \equiv -(a_j \mod x) \pmod{x} \quad \text{or} \quad (a_i \mod x) \equiv (x - (a_j \mod x)) \pmod{x}
   \]

2. For \(a_i - a_j\) to be divisible by \(y\), we need:
   \[
   (a_i \mod y) \equiv (a_j \mod y) \pmod{y}
   \]

### Correct Approach:
To efficiently count the pairs, we can use a frequency dictionary to keep track of the pairs of remainders \((a_i \mod x, a_i \mod y)\). For each element \(a_i\), we check how many previous elements have the required remainders that would form a beautiful pair with \(a_i\).

### Issues in the Provided Code:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Required Modulo for \(x\):**
   The code calculates `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x`. This is correct for finding pairs where \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).

2. **Incorrect Handling of Remainders for \(y\):**
   The code sets `required_mod_y` to `mod_y`, which is incorrect. We need to ensure that the remainders for \(y\) match exactly between the two elements.

3. **Debugging Statements:**
   The code includes several print statements for debugging purposes, which should be removed in the final version.

### Corrected Logic:
For each element \(a_i\):
- Calculate `mod_x = a_i % x` and `mod_y = a_i % y`.
- Determine the required pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` such that:
  - `required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x`
  - `required_mod_y = mod_y`
- Check if this pair exists in the frequency dictionary and add the count to `beautiful_count`.
- Update the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(mod_x, mod_y)`.

### Conclusion:
The provided code has logical errors in handling the required remainders for \(y\). Therefore, the program is not correct as it stands.

**Correctness:** **False**
