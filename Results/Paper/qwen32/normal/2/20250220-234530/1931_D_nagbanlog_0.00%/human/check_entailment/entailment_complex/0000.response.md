### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to find the number of beautiful pairs in an array for multiple test cases. A pair of indices \((i, j)\) is considered beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The logic used in the program is as follows:
- For each element in the array, it calculates the remainders when divided by \(x\) and \(y\).
- It then determines the required remainders for another element to form a beautiful pair with the current element.
- It uses a frequency dictionary to keep track of how many times each pair of remainders has been seen so far.
- For each element, it checks if the required pair of remainders exists in the frequency dictionary and updates the count of beautiful pairs accordingly.
- It then updates the frequency dictionary with the current element's pair of remainders.

Let's verify this logic step-by-step using the provided example:

#### Example Breakdown:
For the input:
```
6 5 2
1 2 7 4 9 6
```

- **Step 1:** Initialize `freq` as an empty dictionary and `beautiful_count` as 0.
- **Step 2:** Process each element in the array:
  - **Element 1:** `mod_x = 1 % 5 = 1`, `mod_y = 1 % 2 = 1`
    - Required pair: `(4, 1)` (since `(5 - 1) % 5 = 4`)
    - `freq` is empty, so no beautiful pairs found yet.
    - Update `freq`: `{(1, 1): 1}`
  - **Element 2:** `mod_x = 2 % 5 = 2`, `mod_y = 2 % 2 = 0`
    - Required pair: `(3, 0)`
    - `freq` does not have `(3, 0)`, so no beautiful pairs found yet.
    - Update `freq`: `{(1, 1): 1, (2, 0): 1}`
  - **Element 7:** `mod_x = 7 % 5 = 2`, `mod_y = 7 % 2 = 1`
    - Required pair: `(3, 1)`
    - `freq` does not have `(3, 1)`, so no beautiful pairs found yet.
    - Update `freq`: `{(1, 1): 1, (2, 0): 1, (2, 1): 1}`
  - **Element 4:** `mod_x = 4 % 5 = 4`, `mod_y = 4 % 2 = 0`
    - Required pair: `(1, 0)`
    - `freq` does not have `(1, 0)`, so no beautiful pairs found yet.
    - Update `freq`: `{(1, 1): 1, (2, 0): 1, (2, 1): 1, (4, 0): 1}`
  - **Element 9:** `mod_x = 9 % 5 = 4`, `mod_y = 9 % 2 = 1`
    - Required pair: `(1, 1)`
    - `freq` has `(1, 1)` once, so 1 beautiful pair found.
    - Update `freq`: `{(1, 1): 2, (2, 0): 1, (2, 1): 1, (4, 0): 1}`
  - **Element 6:** `mod_x = 6 % 5 = 1`, `mod_y = 6 % 2 = 0`
    - Required pair: `(4, 0)`
    - `freq` has `(4, 0)` once, so 1 beautiful pair found.
    - Update `freq`: `{(1, 1): 2, (2, 0): 1, (2, 1): 1, (4, 0): 2}`

- **Total Beautiful Pairs:** 2

This matches the expected output for the given example.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
