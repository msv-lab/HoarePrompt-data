Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a).
- `results` is an empty list.
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are the values extracted from `case['params']`.
- `a` is the list of integers from `case['array']`.
- `freq` has the count of the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1.
- `num` is the next element in the list `a`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
mod_x = num % x
```

### Impact Analysis:
- The code calculates the modulus of `num` with `x` and assigns the result to `mod_x`.
- No other variables are affected by this operation.

### Calculation:
- Since `num` is the next element in the list `a` and `x` is a parameter extracted from `case['params']`, `mod_x` will be the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.

### Output State:
- All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `freq`) remain unchanged.
- `mod_x` is now assigned the value `num % x`.

### Natural Language Description:
The value of `mod_x` is updated to be the remainder of `num` divided by `x`. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the values extracted from `case['params']`, `a` is the list of integers from `case['array']`, `freq` has the count of the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1, `num` is the next element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`.**
