Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is a list containing the final `beautiful_count` for each test case, `case` is the last test case processed in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']`, `freq` is a dictionary with the count of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair encountered in the last test case, `beautiful_count` is the total number of beautiful pairs found in the last test case.**

### Natural Language Description:
After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the following state holds:
- `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10,000, representing the total number of test cases.
- `test_cases` is a list containing all the test cases provided, where each test case includes parameters `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list `a`.
- `results` is a list that contains the `beautiful_count` for each test case, indicating the number of beautiful pairs found in each respective test case.
- `case` refers to the last test case that was processed, which includes its parameters and array.
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are the parameters extracted from the last test case.
- `a` is the list of integers from the last test case.
- `freq` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair encountered in the last test case.
- `beautiful_count` is the total count of beautiful pairs found in the last test case, which is also the last element added to the `results` list.
