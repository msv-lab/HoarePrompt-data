The code snippet assigns the values from the tuple `case['params']` to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. Since `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, and each test case is a tuple `(n, x, y, a)`, `case['params']` refers to the first three elements of this tuple.

Therefore, after executing the code snippet, `n`, `x`, and `y` will be updated to the respective values from the tuple `case['params']`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is a list containing `beautiful_count`, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first three elements of `case['params']`.**
