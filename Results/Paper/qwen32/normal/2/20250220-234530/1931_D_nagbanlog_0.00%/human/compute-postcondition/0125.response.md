The code increments `beautiful_count` by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `test_cases` remains a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a).
- `results` is a list containing the final `beautiful_count` for the current test case.
- `case` remains the next test case in `test_cases`.
- `n` remains the first element of `case['params']`.
- `x` remains the second element of `case['params']`.
- `y` remains the third element of `case['params']`.
- `a` remains `case['array']` and must have at least one element.
- `freq` remains a dictionary where `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.
- `num` remains the next element in the list `a`.
- `mod_x` remains `num % x`.
- `mod_y` remains `num % y`.
- `required_mod_x` remains `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `required_mod_y` remains `mod_y`.
- `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`.
