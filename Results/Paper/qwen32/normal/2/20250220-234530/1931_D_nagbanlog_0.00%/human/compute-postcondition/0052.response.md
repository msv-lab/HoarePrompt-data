The code snippet provided calculates the modulus of `num` with `x` and assigns it to the variable `mod_x`. However, there is no `num` variable defined in the initial state. Assuming `num` was intended to be `n` (as `n` is mentioned in the initial state and is part of the parameters of each test case), the calculation would be `n % x`.

Given this assumption, the new variable `mod_x` will be added to the output state, and its value will be `n % x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is a list containing `beautiful_count`, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first three elements of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0, `mod_x` is `n % x`**.
