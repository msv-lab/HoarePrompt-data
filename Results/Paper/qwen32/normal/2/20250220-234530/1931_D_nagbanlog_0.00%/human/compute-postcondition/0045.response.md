The only variable in the loop head is `case`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases` list. If there are more test cases in the list, the loop will execute again for the next `case`.

At the end of the last iteration, `case` was the last processed test case from `test_cases`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another test case left in `test_cases`. Therefore, `case` should be updated to the next test case in the list.

Let's denote the current `case` as `case_i`. The next `case` would be `case_{i+1}`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is a list containing `beautiful_count`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the values extracted from `case['params']`, `a` is the list of integers from `case['array']`, `freq` is a dictionary with the count of each unique tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` for all elements in `a`, `beautiful_count` is the total number of pairs of elements in `a` that satisfy the condition `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq`, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`**.

Since we don't have specific information about the current index of `case` in `test_cases`, we can denote the new state simply as the next `case` being processed:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is a list containing `beautiful_count`, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`**.
