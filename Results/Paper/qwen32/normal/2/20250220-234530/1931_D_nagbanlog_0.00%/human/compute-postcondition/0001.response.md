To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over `test_cases`, which is not explicitly defined in the provided state. However, based on the context, we can infer that `test_cases` is likely a list containing the test case data.

Given the structure of the loop, the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `case`. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one element. Here's how we can adjust the state:

1. Ensure that `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case.
2. Each test case should be a tuple or a list containing the integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list `a`.

Let's define the state accordingly:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a) with 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `results` is an empty list**.
