The code snippet provided initializes `beautiful_count` to 0. No other variables are modified by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `case`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `freq` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is a list containing `beautiful_count`, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first three elements of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']`, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0.**
