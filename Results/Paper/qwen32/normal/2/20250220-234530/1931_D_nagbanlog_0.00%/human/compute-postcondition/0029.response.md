Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the values extracted from `case['params']`, `a` is the list of integers from `case['array']`, `freq` is a dictionary. If `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not in `freq`, the count of the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` in `freq` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `freq` remains unchanged. `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `num` is the next element in `a` if it exists.**
