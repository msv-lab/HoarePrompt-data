The given code snippet attempts to calculate `mod_y` using the expression `mod_y = num % y`. However, there is no variable `num` defined in the initial state. Given the context, it seems likely that `num` should be `n` (as `n` is the only integer variable mentioned in the initial state that could logically be used in this context).

Assuming `num` should be `n`, the code would then set `mod_y` to `n % y`.

Given this assumption, the updated output state would be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a) with 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `results` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the values extracted from `case['params']`, `a` is the list of integers from `case['array']` and must have at least one element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0, `mod_x` is `n % x`, `mod_y` is `n % y`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. `test_cases` remains a list of at least one test case, each containing integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list `a` of integers. `results` remains an empty list. `n`, `x`, and `y` retain their values extracted from `case['params']`. `a` retains its list of integers from `case['array']`. `freq` remains an empty dictionary. `beautiful_count` remains 0. `mod_x` remains `n % x`. `mod_y` is now `n % y`.
