The code snippet assigns the integer value of the user input to the variable `ap`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, and for each test case, there are two integers `x` and `y` between 0 and 99, inclusive. These variables (`t`, `x`, and `y`) are not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, and `ap` is an input integer.**
