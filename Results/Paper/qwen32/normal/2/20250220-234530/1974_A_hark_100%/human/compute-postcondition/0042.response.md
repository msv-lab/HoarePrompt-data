Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is incremented by 1. If `x > 0 and y > 0`, then `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, where `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`. If `x <= 0`, `bxsfory1` is 0; otherwise, `bxsfory1` is `math.ceil(x / 15)`. If `x == 0 and y > 0`, the values of `t`, `ap`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged except that `k` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `ap`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged except that `k` is incremented by 1.**
