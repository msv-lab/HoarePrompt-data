The value of `x` is updated based on the given formula: `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. Here, `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`.

Given that `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`, the new value of `x` can be expressed as `x = x - ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4`.

The values of `t`, `ap`, and `k` remain unchanged. The value of `y` remains the same, and `bxsfory` is derived from `y`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is incremented by 1, `x` is updated to `x - ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4`, `y` is the same integer read from the input, `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`.**
