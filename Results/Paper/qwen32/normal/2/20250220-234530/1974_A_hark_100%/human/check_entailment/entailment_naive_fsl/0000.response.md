Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for certain inputs. Let's analyze the code and identify the problems:

1. **Function Definition and Call Order**: The function `func_1()` is called before it is defined, which will result in a `NameError`.

2. **Logic Errors**:
   - The calculation for `bxsfory` is incorrect. It should consider how many `2x2` icons can fit on a screen and how much space is left for `1x1` icons.
   - The adjustment of `x` after placing `2x2` icons is incorrect. The formula `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` does not correctly account for the remaining space on the screen after placing `2x2` icons.
   - The logic for calculating the number of screens required for `1x1` icons after placing `2x2` icons is flawed.

Let's consider a specific example to demonstrate the issue:

**Test Case**:
```
1
10 1
```

**Expected Output**:
```
1
```

**Explanation**:
- One `2x2` icon takes up 4 cells, leaving 11 cells available on the screen.
- The remaining 10 `1x1` icons can fit into the remaining 11 cells.

However, the provided code would incorrectly calculate the number of screens needed for this case.

Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        screens = 0
        
        # Place 2x2 icons first
        screens += y // 2
        y %= 2
        
        # If there's one 2x2 icon left, it needs a full screen
        if y == 1:
            screens += 1
            remaining_cells = 11  # 15 total cells - 4 cells used by 2x2 icon
        else:
            remaining_cells = 15  # Full screen available
        
        # Place 1x1 icons in the remaining cells
        if x > 0:
            screens += math.ceil(x / remaining_cells)
        
        print(screens)

func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that the `2x2` icons are placed first, and then the remaining `1x1` icons are placed in the leftover space, or additional screens are added as necessary.
