The code calculates `bxsfory` by taking the ceiling of `y / 2`. This means `bxsfory` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`.

Given that `y` is an integer greater than 0, `bxsfory` will be an integer greater than or equal to 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the input with `x` greater than 0 and `y` greater than 0, and `ap` is an integer greater than 0; `bxsfory` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`.**
