Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is an integer greater than 0, and `x` and `y` are integers. If `x` > 0 and `y` > 0, then `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, where `bxsfory` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the conditions remain as specified in the if part. Otherwise, either `x` is less than or equal to 0, or `y` is less than or equal to 0, and it is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0. Additionally, it is ensured that it is not the case that `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is equal to 0.**
