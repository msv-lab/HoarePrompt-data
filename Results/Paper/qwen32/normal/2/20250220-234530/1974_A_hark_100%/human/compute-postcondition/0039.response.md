Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `ap` is an integer greater than 0.
- `k` is incremented by 1 (though `k` is not used in the provided print statement).
- `x` is the first integer from the input.
- `y` is the second integer from the input.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(0)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(0)` statement is straightforward. It simply prints the integer `0` regardless of the values of `t`, `ap`, `k`, `x`, or `y`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
