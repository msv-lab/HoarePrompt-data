Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is incremented by 1, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input. If `x == 0 and y > 0`, the values of `t`, `ap`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged except that `k` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `ap`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged except that `k` is incremented by 1.**
