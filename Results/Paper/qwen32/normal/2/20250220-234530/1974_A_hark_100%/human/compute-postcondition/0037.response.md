To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `ap` is an integer greater than 0.
- `k` is incremented by 1 (though `k` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `x` is the first integer from the input.
- `y` is the second integer from the input.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(math.ceil(y / 2))
```

Here, the function `math.ceil()` is used to round up the division result of `y / 2` to the nearest integer. 

Let's analyze the expression `math.ceil(y / 2)`:
- `y` is the second integer from the input.
- `y / 2` computes the division of `y` by 2.
- `math.ceil(y / 2)` rounds up the result of `y / 2` to the nearest integer.

Since the exact value of `y` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `math.ceil(y / 2)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the ceiling of `y / 2`.

Therefore, the output will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`.

Output: **the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(y / 2\) (where \(y\) is the second integer from the input)**
