You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for certain inputs. Let's analyze the code and identify the problems:

1. **Function Definition and Call Order**: The function `func_1()` is called before it is defined, which will result in a `NameError`.

2. **Logic Errors**:
   - The calculation for `bxsfory` is incorrect. It should consider how many `2x2` icons can fit on a screen and how much space is left for `1x1` icons.
   - The adjustment of `x` after placing `2x2` icons is incorrect. The formula `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` does not correctly account for the remaining space on the screen after placing `2x2` icons.
   - The logic for calculating the number of screens required for `1x1` icons after placing `2x2` icons is flawed.

Let's consider a specific example to demonstrate the issue:

**Test Case**:
```
1
10 1
```

**Expected Output**:
```
1
```

**Explanation**:
- One `2x2` icon takes up 4 cells, leaving 11 cells available on the screen.
- The remaining 10 `1x1` icons can fit into the remaining 11 cells.

However, the provided code would incorrectly calculate the number of screens needed for this case.

Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        screens = 0
        
        # Place 2x2 icons first
        screens += y // 2
        y %= 2
        
        # If there's one 2x2 icon left, it needs a full screen
        if y == 1:
            screens += 1
            remaining_cells = 11  # 15 total cells - 4 cells used by 2x2 icon
        else:
            remaining_cells = 15  # Full screen available
        
        # Place 1x1 icons in the remaining cells
        if x > 0:
            screens += math.ceil(x / remaining_cells)
        
        print(screens)

func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that the `2x2` icons are placed first, and then the remaining `1x1` icons are placed in the leftover space, or additional screens are added as necessary.
