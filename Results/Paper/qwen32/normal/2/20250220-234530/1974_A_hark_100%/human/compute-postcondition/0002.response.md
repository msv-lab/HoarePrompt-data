The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The initial state specifies that `x` and `y` are integers within the range 0 to 99. After executing the code, the values of `x` and `y` will be updated to whatever integers are provided in the input, while `t` and `ap` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are the integers provided by the input, and `ap` is an integer greater than 0.**
