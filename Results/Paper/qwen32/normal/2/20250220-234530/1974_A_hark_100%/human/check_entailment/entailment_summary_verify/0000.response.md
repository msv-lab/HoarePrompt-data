### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Code Analysis:

1. **Function Definition and Call Order**:
   - The function `func_1()` is called before it is defined, which indeed results in a `NameError`. This is a critical issue that prevents the program from running correctly.

2. **Logic Errors**:
   - The calculation for `bxsfory` (`math.ceil(y / 2)`) is intended to determine the number of screens needed for the `2x2` icons. However, the subsequent logic for adjusting `x` and calculating `bxsfory1` is flawed.
   - Specifically, the formula `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. It does not properly account for the remaining space on the screen after placing `2x2` icons. Each `2x2` icon occupies 4 cells, so the remaining space on a screen after placing `bxsfory` `2x2` icons should be calculated accordingly.
   - The logic for calculating the number of screens required for `1x1` icons after placing `2x2` icons is also flawed. The formula `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)` assumes that each screen can hold 15 `1x1` icons, which is incorrect because some cells might already be occupied by `2x2` icons.

#### Example Analysis:

Let's consider the test case `10 1`:
- One `2x2` icon takes up 4 cells, leaving 11 cells available on the screen.
- The remaining 10 `1x1` icons can fit into the remaining 11 cells.
- According to the provided code, the calculation would be incorrect because it does not account for the remaining space properly.

#### Corrected Logic:

A corrected version of the logic should be:
1. Place as many `2x2` icons as possible on a screen.
2. Calculate the remaining space on the screen after placing `2x2` icons.
3. Place `1x1` icons in the remaining space.
4. If there are still `1x1` icons left after filling all screens, allocate additional screens for them.

Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
import math

def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        screens = 0
        
        # Place 2x2 icons first
        screens += y // 2
        y %= 2
        
        # If there's one 2x2 icon left, it needs a full screen
        if y == 1:
            screens += 1
            remaining_cells = 11  # 15 total cells - 4 cells used by 2x2 icon
        else:
            remaining_cells = 15  # Full screen available
        
        # Place 1x1 icons in the remaining cells
        if x > 0:
            screens += math.ceil(x / remaining_cells)
        
        print(screens)

func_1()
```

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program has significant issues, including a `NameError` due to incorrect function call order and flawed logic for calculating the number of screens required. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final:** **False**
