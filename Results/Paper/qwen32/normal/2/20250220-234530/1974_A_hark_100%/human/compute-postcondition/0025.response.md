To determine what will be printed by the `print(math.ceil(y / 2))` statement, let's analyze the given initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `ap` is an integer greater than 0.
- `k` is incremented by 1 (though `k` is not used in the print statement).
- `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input.

The `print` statement specifically involves the variable `y` and uses the `math.ceil` function to compute the ceiling of `y / 2`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `y` is an integer read from the input.
- `y / 2` computes the division of `y` by 2, which may result in a floating-point number.
- `math.ceil(y / 2)` rounds up the result of `y / 2` to the nearest integer.

Since the exact value of `y` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value to be printed. However, we can describe the output precisely in terms of `y`.

Output: **math.ceil(y / 2) (where y is the second integer read from the input)**
