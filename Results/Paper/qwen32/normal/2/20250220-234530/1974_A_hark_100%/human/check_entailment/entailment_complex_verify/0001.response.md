### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Function Definition and Input Handling:
- The program starts by calling `func_1()`, which reads the number of test cases (`ap`) and iterates over each test case.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons respectively.

#### Logic for Placing Icons:
- **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:**
  - The program calculates `bxsfory` as `math.ceil(y / 2)`. This is correct because each screen can hold at most 2 of the 2x2 icons (each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and a 5x3 grid can fit at most 2 such icons without overlapping).
  - The program then adjusts `x` by subtracting `bxsfory * 15` and adding `y * 4`. This adjustment is incorrect. Subtracting `bxsfory * 15` implies that each screen used for 2x2 icons leaves 15 cells free for 1x1 icons, which is not accurate. Each screen used for 2x2 icons actually leaves 11 cells free (15 total cells minus 4 cells occupied by 2x2 icons).
  - The program calculates `bxsfory1` as `math.ceil(x / 15)`, which is incorrect because it assumes that the remaining space can be filled by 1x1 icons in multiples of 15 cells, which is not necessarily true. It should consider the actual remaining cells per screen.
  
- **Case 2: Only `y` is greater than 0:**
  - The program prints `math.ceil(y / 2)`, which is correct as each screen can hold at most 2 of the 2x2 icons.

- **Case 3: Only `x` is greater than 0:**
  - The program prints `math.ceil(x / 15)`, which is incorrect. Each screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons, so the correct formula should be `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

- **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0:**
  - The program correctly prints `0` as no screens are needed.

#### Issues Identified:
- The logic for handling both `x` and `y` being greater than 0 is flawed. Specifically, the way `x` is adjusted and the subsequent calculation of `bxsfory1` are incorrect.
- The calculation for the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons when `y` is 0 is incorrect. It should be `math.ceil(x / 15)` instead of `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues, the program does not correctly compute the minimum number of screens needed in all cases.

**Final:** **False**
