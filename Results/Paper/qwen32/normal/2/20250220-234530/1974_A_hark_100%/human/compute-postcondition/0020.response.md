The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The initial state specifies that `t`, `ap`, and `k` have certain properties, but these are not affected by the code snippet provided. The only variables that change are `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is incremented by 1, `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input.**
This means that `x` and `y` now hold the values specified by the user input, while `t`, `ap`, and the incremented `k` retain their previous properties and values.
