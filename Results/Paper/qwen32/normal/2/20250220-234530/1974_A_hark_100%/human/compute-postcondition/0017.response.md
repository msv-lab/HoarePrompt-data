Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the input, and `ap` is an integer greater than 0. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the conditions remain as specified in the if part. Otherwise, either `x` is less than or equal to 0, or `y` is less than or equal to 0, and it is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0. Additionally, it is ensured that it is not the case that `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is equal to 0.**
