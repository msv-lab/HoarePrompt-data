The given code snippet modifies the string `s` by removing the substring 'ap' from the first occurrence of 'map'. Here's the breakdown:

- The original string `s` contains at least one 'map'.
- The code finds the index of the first occurrence of 'map' in `s` using `s.find('map')`.
- It then constructs a new string by concatenating the part of `s` before 'ma' (`s[:s.find('map')]`) and the part of `s` after 'map' (`s[s.find('map') + 3:]`), effectively removing 'ap' from 'map'.

Since `s` originally contained at least one 'map', the length of `s` will decrease by 2 characters after this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\) (but now `n` is reduced by 2), `s` is a string of length `n-2` that no longer contains 'ap' from the first 'map', `ans` is 2**.
