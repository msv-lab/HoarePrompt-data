Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to process multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, we have a string `s`.
   - We need to determine the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" from `s`.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.
   - It then calls `func_1(s)` to compute the minimum number of deletions required.
   - Inside `func_1(s)`, the program checks if the string `s` is exactly "mapie". If so, it returns 1. However, this special case is not necessary because the subsequent logic would handle it correctly.
   - The program enters two while loops:
     - The first loop removes all occurrences of "map" by finding the index of "map" and removing it by concatenating the parts of the string before and after "map".
     - The second loop does the same for "pie".
   - Each time a substring is removed, the counter `ans` is incremented.
   - Finally, the function returns the total count of deletions `ans`.

3. **Evaluating the Logic:**
   - The logic for removing substrings "map" and "pie" is correct. The `find()` method locates the first occurrence of the substring, and slicing is used to remove it.
   - The program counts the number of deletions accurately.
   - However, there is a potential issue with the special case check `if s == 'mapie': return 1`. This is unnecessary because the subsequent logic would handle this case correctly by removing both "map" and "pie" in separate steps, resulting in a total of 2 deletions. But since the problem specifies that the minimum deletions are required, and removing "map" and "pie" separately results in the minimum deletions, this special case does not affect the correctness of the solution.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Strings without "map" or "pie" should return 0, which the program handles correctly.
   - Strings with multiple occurrences of "map" and "pie" should be handled correctly by the while loops.
   - Strings with overlapping "map" and "pie" substrings are not explicitly tested but should be handled correctly by the removal logic.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful by removing all occurrences of "map" and "pie". The special case check is unnecessary but does not affect the correctness of the solution.

**Correctness: True**
