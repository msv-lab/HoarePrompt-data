You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func_1(s):
    if (s == 'mapie') :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. Additionally, the string s is not equal to 'mapie'.
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
        
        ans += 1
        
    #State: t is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), n is the new length of s after all 'map' substrings have been removed, s is a string of length n that no longer contains 'map', ans is the total number of times 'map' was found and removed.
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
        
        ans += 1
        
    #State: - `t` remains unchanged because it is not modified by the loop.
    #- `n` will be the new length of `s` after all "pie" substrings have been removed.
    #- `s` will no longer contain any occurrences of "pie".
    #- `ans` will be the total number of times "pie" was found and removed.
    #
    #Since the exact string `s` and the number of "pie" occurrences are not provided, we can only describe the final state in terms of these variables.
    #
    #Output State:
    return ans
    #The program returns the total number of times "pie" was found and removed from the string `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It returns 1 if no occurrences of the substring "pie" are found in the string. Otherwise, it returns the total number of times the substring "pie" was found and removed from the string `s`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 1

Case_2: The program returns the total number of times "pie" was found and removed from the string `s`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
