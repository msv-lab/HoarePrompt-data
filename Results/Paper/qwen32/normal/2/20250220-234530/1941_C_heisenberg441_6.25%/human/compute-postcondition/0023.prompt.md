Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), n is the new length of s after all 'map' substrings have been removed, s is a string of length n that no longer contains 'map', ans is the total number of times 'map' was found and removed.
Code of the loop:
while s.find('pie') != -1:
    s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
    ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the new length of `s` after all 'map' substrings have been removed, decreased by 4; `s` is a string that no longer contains the first occurrence of 'pie' and the character immediately following it; `ans` is the total number of times 'map' was found and removed, increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the new length of `s` after all 'map' substrings have been removed, decreased by 4; `s` is a string that contains the substring 'e' (from the original 'pie') and any characters before and after 'pie' except 'pi'; `ans` is the total number of times 'map' was found and removed, increased by 2.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the new length of `s` after all 'map' substrings have been removed, decreased by 4; `s` is a string that no longer contains 'pie' at the original position; `ans` is the total number of times 'map' was found and removed, increased by 3.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
