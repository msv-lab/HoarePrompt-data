Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always produce the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. Let's consider a specific example to demonstrate this:

### Counterexample:
**Input:**
```
1
10
mpimapiepi
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
To make the string "mpimapiepi" beautiful, we need to remove the minimum number of characters to eliminate both "map" and "pie" substrings. One optimal way to do this is to remove the following characters:
- Remove the 'm' at index 1 and the 'a' at index 2 to remove "map".
- Remove the 'p' at index 5 and the 'e' at index 7 to remove "pie".

This results in the string "mpiipi", which is beautiful after removing 3 characters.

**Actual Output from the Program:**
The program will likely remove characters in a greedy manner, possibly leading to more deletions than necessary. For instance, it might first remove the 'm', 'a', and 'p' from "map", resulting in "miimapiepi", and then remove the 'p', 'i', and 'e' from "pie", leading to more deletions than needed.

### Why the Program is Incorrect:
The program uses a greedy approach by repeatedly finding and removing the first occurrence of "map" and "pie" substrings. This approach does not guarantee the minimum number of deletions because it does not consider the overlap or interaction between different substrings. A more sophisticated algorithm would be needed to ensure the minimum deletions, possibly involving dynamic programming or other optimization techniques.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all cases optimally.
