Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to make a string `s` beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters.
- A string is considered ugly if it contains the substrings "pie" or "map".
- We need to handle multiple test cases.

### Program Analysis:

#### Step 1: Input Handling
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.

#### Step 2: Function `func_1`
- The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the minimum number of deletions required to make the string `s` beautiful.
- The function starts by checking if the string is exactly "mapie". If it is, it returns 1. However, this check is unnecessary and incorrect because "mapie" is not a special case that requires only one deletion; it should be handled like any other string containing "map" and "pie".
- The function then enters two while loops:
  - The first loop removes occurrences of "map" by finding the first occurrence of "map" and deleting the middle character ('a'), then increments the answer counter `ans`.
  - The second loop does the same for "pie".

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Special Case Handling**: The special case check for "mapie" is incorrect and unnecessary. It should be removed.
2. **Greedy Approach Flaw**: The current approach is greedy and may not always yield the optimal solution. For example, consider the string "mappie". Removing "map" first would leave "pie", which still needs to be removed, resulting in 2 deletions. However, removing "pie" first would leave "map", which also needs to be removed, but in this case, we could potentially do better by removing different characters.
3. **Efficiency Concerns**: The repeated use of `find` and string slicing inside the while loops can be inefficient, especially for long strings.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct result for all possible inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**

To fix the program, a more sophisticated algorithm that considers all possible ways to remove characters to eliminate both "map" and "pie" substrings optimally would be needed. This might involve dynamic programming or other advanced techniques.
