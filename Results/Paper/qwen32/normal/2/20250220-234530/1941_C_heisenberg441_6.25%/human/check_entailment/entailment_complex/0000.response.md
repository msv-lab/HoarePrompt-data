### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its logic against the problem requirements.

1. **Initial Check**: The function first checks if the string `s` is exactly "mapie". If it is, the function returns 1. However, according to the problem statement, the string "mapie" should be treated as containing both "map" and "pie", and thus should require two deletions (one for "map" and one for "pie"). This part of the function is incorrect.

2. **Removing "map" Substrings**: The function correctly identifies and removes occurrences of the substring "map" by finding the first occurrence using `s.find('map')`, slicing the string to exclude "map", and incrementing the `ans` counter each time a removal is made.

3. **Removing "pie" Substrings**: Similarly, the function correctly identifies and removes occurrences of the substring "pie" using the same method as for "map".

4. **Returning the Result**: After all occurrences of "map" and "pie" have been removed, the function returns the total count of deletions (`ans`).

### Issues Identified:
- The initial check for `s == 'mapie'` returning 1 is incorrect. It should behave the same way as other strings containing "map" and "pie", which means it should return 2 (one for each substring).

### Correctness:
Given the identified issue with the initial check for "mapie", the function is not entirely correct as per the problem requirements.

**Correctness: False**
