The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `ans` is 1, so after the increment, `ans` becomes 2. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `s` is a string of length `n` with the first occurrence of 'map' modified to 'm', `ans` is 2**.
