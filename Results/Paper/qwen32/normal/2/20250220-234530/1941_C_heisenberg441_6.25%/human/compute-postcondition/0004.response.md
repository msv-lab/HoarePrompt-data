To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition `s.find('map') != -1`. This condition checks if the substring `'map'` exists within the string `s`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- Each test case consists of an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\)
- A string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(10^6\)
- The string `s` is not equal to `'mapie'`
- `ans` is 0

We need to ensure that `s.find('map') != -1` evaluates to `True`, meaning the substring `'map'` must be present in `s`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in Loop Condition**: The only variable in the loop condition is `s`.
2. **Condition Analysis**: The loop will execute if `s` contains the substring `'map'`.
3. **Current State**: The current state specifies that `s` is not equal to `'mapie'`, but it doesn't specify whether `'map'` is a substring of `s`.
4. **Adjustment Requirement**: To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `s` contains the substring `'map'`.

### Adjustment:

Since the only variable we can adjust is `s`, we need to modify `s` such that it contains the substring `'map'`. One straightforward way to do this is to ensure that `'map'` is part of the string `s`.

### Modified State:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), each test case consists of an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\), and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters that includes the substring `'map'`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(10^6\), `ans` is 0**

This ensures that the condition `s.find('map') != -1` is satisfied, allowing the `while` loop to execute at least once.
