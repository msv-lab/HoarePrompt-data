The only variable in the loop head is `s`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the presence of the substring `'pie'` in `s`. If `s` contains the substring `'pie'`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string that contains the substring `'e'` (from the original `'pie'`) and any characters before and after `'pie'` except `'pi'`. However, this does not guarantee that the substring `'pie'` is still present in `s` after the loop body has executed (which presumably removes some part of the string).

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that the substring `'pie'` is still present in `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the new length of `s` after all 'map' substrings have been removed, decreased by 4; `s` is a string that contains the substring 'pie'; `ans` is the total number of times 'map' was found and removed, increased by 2.**
