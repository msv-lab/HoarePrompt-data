Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. If the string `s` is exactly 'mapie', it returns 1. Otherwise, it removes all occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' from `s`, counting how many times each was removed, and returns the total count of these removals.**
