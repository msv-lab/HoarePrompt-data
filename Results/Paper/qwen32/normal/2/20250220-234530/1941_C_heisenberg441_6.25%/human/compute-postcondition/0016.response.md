Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the new length of `s` after all 'map' substrings have been removed, decreased by 4; `s` is a string that no longer contains the first occurrence of 'pie' and the character immediately following it; `ans` is the total number of times 'map' was found and removed, increased by 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, reflecting one additional removal of the substring 'map'. All other variables (`t`, `n`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
