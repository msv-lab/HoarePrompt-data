Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of lowercase English letters and checks if there exists a permutation of `s` that is different from `s`. If such a permutation exists, it prints "Yes" followed by one such permutation; otherwise, it prints "No".**
