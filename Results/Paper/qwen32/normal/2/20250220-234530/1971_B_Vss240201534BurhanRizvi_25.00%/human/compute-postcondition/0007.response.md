Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `s` is the string representation of `t`.
- `s2` is a permutation of the characters in `s`.
- It is explicitly stated that `s` is equal to `s2`.

Given these conditions, let's break down the implications:
- Since `s` is equal to `s2`, and `s2` is a permutation of the characters in `s`, the only permutation of `s` that is equal to `s` itself is `s` itself. This means `s2` must be identical to `s`.

However, the `print` statement in the code is:
```python
print('No')
```

This statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `s`, or `s2`. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **No**
