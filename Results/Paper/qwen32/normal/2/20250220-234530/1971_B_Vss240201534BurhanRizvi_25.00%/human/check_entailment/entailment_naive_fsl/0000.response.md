Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program uses `random.sample` to shuffle the string `s`. While this approach may work for many cases, it does not guarantee that a different permutation will always be generated, especially for strings with repeated characters. For example, consider the string "aaaaa". Any permutation of "aaaaa" will still be "aaaaa", so the condition `if s != s2` may fail, leading to an incorrect "No" output. This means the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, making it incorrect according to the problem description.
