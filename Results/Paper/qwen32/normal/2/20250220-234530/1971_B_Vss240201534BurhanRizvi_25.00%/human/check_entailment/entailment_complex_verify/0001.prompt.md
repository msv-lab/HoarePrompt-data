You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
import random

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The loop has processed all `t` test cases, printing "Yes" followed by a random permutation of the input string `s` if `s` is not equal to the permutation; otherwise, it prints "No". The value of `t` and any other variables not modified by the loop remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of lowercase English letters and checks if there exists a permutation of `s` that is different from `s`. If such a permutation exists, it prints "Yes" followed by one such permutation; otherwise, it prints "No".


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by generating random permutations of the input string `s` and checking if the generated permutation is different from the original string. If a different permutation is found, it outputs "YES" followed by the permutation; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

However, there are a few issues with this approach:

1. **Randomness and Efficiency**: The program uses `random.sample` to generate permutations, which may require multiple attempts to find a permutation that is different from the original string. This could lead to inefficiency, especially for strings with many repeated characters (like "aaaaa"), where it might take many iterations to find a different permutation.

2. **Guaranteed Termination**: There is no guarantee that the program will terminate in a reasonable time for all inputs. For example, if the input string consists of all identical characters (e.g., "aaaaaaaaaa"), the program might keep generating the same permutation indefinitely.

3. **Deterministic Approach**: A more efficient and deterministic approach would be to check if there are at least two distinct characters in the string. If there are, we can swap these characters to create a new permutation. If there is only one distinct character, it is impossible to rearrange the string to form a different string.

Given these points, while the program might work for some inputs, it does not guarantee correctness for all inputs within a reasonable time frame.

Correctness: **False**
