To determine the output of the `print(s2)` statement, let's break down the initial state:

1. **Variable `t`:** It is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
2. **Variable `s`:** It is the string representation of the integer `t`. For example, if `t` is 123, then `s` would be "123".
3. **Variable `s2`:** It is a permutation of the characters in `s`, and it is explicitly stated that `s` is not equal to `s2`.

Given these conditions, `s2` is a rearrangement of the digits of `t` into a different order. Since `s2` is a permutation and not equal to `s`, it means that the digits of `t` have been reordered in some way.

For instance:
- If `t` is 123, `s` would be "123", and `s2` could be any permutation of "123" except "123" itself, such as "321", "231", "213", "312", or "132".

Since the exact value of `t` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `s2`. However, we know that `s2` will be a permutation of the digits of `t` that is different from `s`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(s2)` statement will be a permutation of the digits of `t` that is not equal to `s`.

Output: **s2 (where s2 is a permutation of the digits of t that is not equal to s)**
