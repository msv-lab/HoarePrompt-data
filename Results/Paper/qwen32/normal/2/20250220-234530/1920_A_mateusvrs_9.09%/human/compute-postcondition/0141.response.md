The code snippet provided is `tmp += 1`. This line increments the value of the variable `tmp` by 1. No other variables in the initial state are mentioned or affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `bx` is the maximum value of `x` when `a` is `1`
- `ax` is the minimum value of `x` when `a` is `2`
- `cx` is a set of all unique `x` when `a` is neither `1` nor `2` and must contain at least one element
- `n` is the input integer
- `r` includes `1000000009` and possibly `0`
- `bx` is less than `ax`
- `i` is the next element in `cx`

The only change is to the variable `tmp`.

Output State: **`bx` is the maximum value of `x` when `a` is `1`, `ax` is the minimum value of `x` when `a` is `2`, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` when `a` is neither `1` nor `2` and must contain at least one element, `n` is the input integer, `r` includes `1000000009` and possibly `0`, `bx` is less than `ax`, `i` is the next element in `cx`, `tmp` is incremented by 1.**
