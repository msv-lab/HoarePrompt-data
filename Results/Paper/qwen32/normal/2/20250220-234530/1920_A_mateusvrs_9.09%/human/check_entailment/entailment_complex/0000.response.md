### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided program to ensure it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `t` is read to determine the number of test cases.
   - `r` is initialized as an empty list to store the results for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, `n` is read to determine the number of constraints.
   - `cx` is initialized as an empty set to store the values of `x` for constraints of type 3.
   - `ax` is initialized to a large number (`1000000000 + 7`), representing the minimum value for constraints of type 2.
   - `bx` is initialized to `-1`, representing the maximum value for constraints of type 1.

3. **Reading Constraints:**
   - For each constraint, the type `a` and the value `x` are read.
   - If `a` is 1, `bx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `x`.
   - If `a` is 2, `ax` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `x`.
   - If `a` is 3, `x` is added to the set `cx`.

4. **Determining Valid Range:**
   - After reading all constraints, the program checks if `bx` (maximum value for type 1 constraints) is greater than or equal to `ax` (minimum value for type 2 constraints).
     - If true, it means there is no valid `k` that satisfies both types of constraints simultaneously, so `0` is appended to `r`.
     - If false, the program calculates the number of valid `k` values in the range `[bx, ax]` excluding those in `cx`.
       - It initializes `tmp` to `0` to count the number of elements in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.
       - It iterates over `cx` and increments `tmp` for each element that is within the range `[bx, ax]`.
       - Finally, it appends the result `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` to `r`, which represents the number of valid `k` values.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the results stored in `r` are printed, each on a new line.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints for each test case. It handles the constraints of type 1 and type 2 to establish a valid range and excludes values specified by constraints of type 3 from this range. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
