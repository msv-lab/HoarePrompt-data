The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `x`. This means that the values of `a` and `x` will be updated based on the input provided.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `n`, `r`, `cx`, `ax`, and `bx` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by the code. Since the code only updates `a` and `x`, the rest of the variables retain their initial values.

Here's the output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `r` is an empty list; `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 3, otherwise `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`; `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is 1 or 3, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and `x`; `bx` is `x` if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1; `a` and `x` are the integers read from the input where `a` ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.**

In simpler terms, the values of `a` and `x` are updated to whatever integers are provided in the input, while all other variables retain their initial values as described.
