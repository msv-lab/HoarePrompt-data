Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - It initializes an empty list `r` to store the results for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - It initializes a set `cx` to keep track of values that `k` cannot be (type 3 constraints).
   - It initializes `ax` to a large value (`1000000000 + 7`) and `bx` to `-1`. These variables will hold the maximum lower bound (from type 1 constraints) and the minimum upper bound (from type 2 constraints), respectively.

3. **Reading Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, it reads the type `a` and the value `x`.
   - If `a` is `1`, it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `bx` and `x` (since `k` must be at least `x`).
   - If `a` is `2`, it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `ax` and `x` (since `k` must be at most `x`).
   - If `a` is `3`, it adds `x` to the set `cx` (since `k` cannot be `x`).

4. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` (the minimum value `k` can take) is greater than or equal to `ax` (the maximum value `k` can take). If so, it means there are no possible values for `k` that satisfy all constraints, and it appends `0` to the result list `r`.

5. **Counting Valid `k` Values**:
   - If `bx < ax`, it calculates the total number of integers from `bx` to `ax` inclusive, which is `ax - bx + 1`.
   - It then subtracts the count of integers in the set `cx` that fall within this range (`tmp`), since these values are not allowed.
   - The result is appended to the list `r`.

6. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints all the results stored in `r`, separated by newlines.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic correctly identifies the feasible range for `k` using the type 1 and type 2 constraints.
- It correctly excludes values specified by type 3 constraints.
- The calculation of the number of valid `k` values is accurate.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem statement, such as when no valid `k` exists.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
