The code appends a new value to the list `r`. This new value is calculated as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.

- `bx` is the maximum value of `x` when `a` is `1`.
- `ax` is the minimum value of `x` when `a` is `2`.
- `cx` is a set of all unique `x` when `a` is neither `1` nor `2`.
- `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive).

Since `bx < ax`, the expression `ax - bx + 1` represents the number of integers from `bx` to `ax` inclusive. Subtracting `tmp` from this value gives the number of integers in this range that are not in `cx`.

Therefore, the updated state of `r` will include the newly appended value.

Output State: **`bx` is the maximum value of `x` when `a` is `1`; `ax` is the minimum value of `x` when `a` is `2`; `cx` is a set of all unique `x` when `a` is neither `1` nor `2`; `n` is the input integer; `r` includes `1000000009`, `0`, and `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.**
