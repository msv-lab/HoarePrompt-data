The code snippet `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `tmp`, we can only state that its value increases by 1.

Output State: **`bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was `1`, `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was `2`, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` values encountered when `a` was `3` and contains at least one element, `r` includes the new element `1000000009`, `bx` is less than `ax`, `i` is the next element from `cx` that hasn't been processed yet, `tmp` is increased by 1**.
