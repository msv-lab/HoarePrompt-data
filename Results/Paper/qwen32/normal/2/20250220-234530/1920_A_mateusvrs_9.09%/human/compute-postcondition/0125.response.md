The code snippet `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Given the initial state, `cx` is initially an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, and contains `{x}` otherwise. After executing `cx.add(x)`, `cx` will definitely contain `x`.

Here's the updated state:

- If `a` is 1 or 2, `cx` was initially an empty set and now contains `{x}`.
- If `a` is not 1 or 2, `cx` already contained `{x}` and remains unchanged.

Therefore, the new state of `cx` is `{x}` regardless of the initial value of `a`.

Output State: **`a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `cx` is `{x}`, `n` is greater than 0, `r` includes the element 1000000009**.
