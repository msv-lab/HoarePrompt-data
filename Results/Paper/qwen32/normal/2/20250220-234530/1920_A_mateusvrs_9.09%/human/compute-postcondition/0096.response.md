The code appends a new element to the list `r`. This new element is calculated as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. The values of `bx`, `ax`, and `tmp` remain unchanged, but `r` now includes this newly calculated value.

Output State: **`bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was `1`, `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was `2`, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` values encountered when `a` was `3`, `n` is `0`, `r` includes the new elements `1000000009` and `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, `bx` is less than `ax`, and `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive.**
