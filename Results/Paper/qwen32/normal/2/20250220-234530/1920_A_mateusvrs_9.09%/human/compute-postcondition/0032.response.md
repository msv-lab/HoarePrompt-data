To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the variables `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` evolve with each iteration based on the constraints provided by the input pairs `(a, x)`.

### Key Points:
- **`ax`**: Initially set to 1000000007. It gets updated to the minimum value of itself and `x` whenever `a` is 2.
- **`bx`**: Initially set to -1. It gets updated to the maximum value of itself and `x` whenever `a` is 1.
- **`cx`**: Initially an empty set. It adds `x` to the set whenever `a` is 3.

### Iteration Process:
- For each iteration, the loop reads a pair `(a, x)`.
- If `a` is 1, it updates `bx` to be the maximum of its current value and `x`.
- If `a` is 2, it updates `ax` to be the minimum of its current value and `x`.
- If `a` is 3, it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

### Final Output State:
After all `n` iterations, the final values of `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` will reflect the cumulative effects of all the constraints provided by the input pairs.

- **`ax`**: The smallest value of `x` encountered when `a` was 2.
- **`bx`**: The largest value of `x` encountered when `a` was 1.
- **`cx`**: A set containing all unique values of `x` encountered when `a` was 3.

### Conclusion:
Given that the loop runs `n` times, the final state will be determined by the last valid updates to `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` based on all the input pairs.

**Output State:** **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `r` is an empty list; `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values where `a` was 3; `ax` is the minimum `x` value where `a` was 2; `bx` is the maximum `x` value where `a` was 1.**

In simpler terms:
- `ax` will hold the smallest `x` from all type 2 constraints.
- `bx` will hold the largest `x` from all type 1 constraints.
- `cx` will contain all unique `x` values from all type 3 constraints.
- `t` and `n` remain unchanged as per their initial values.
- `r` remains an empty list as it is not modified in the loop.
