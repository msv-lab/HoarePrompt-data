Postcondition: **`bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was `1`, `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was `2`, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` values encountered when `a` was `3`, `n` is `0`, and `r` includes the element `1000000009`. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` also includes the element `0`. If `bx` is less than `ax`, `r` also includes the element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive.**
