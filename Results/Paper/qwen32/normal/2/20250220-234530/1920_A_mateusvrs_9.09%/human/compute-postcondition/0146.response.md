To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case and accumulates results in the list `r`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the loop operates:

1. **Initialization**: For each test case, `cx` is initialized as an empty set, `ax` is set to a large value (`1000000007`), and `bx` is set to `-1`.
2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - If a constraint is of type `1` (i.e., `a == 1`), `bx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `x`.
   - If a constraint is of type `2` (i.e., `a == 2`), `ax` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `x`.
   - If a constraint is of type `3` (i.e., `a == 3`), `x` is added to the set `cx`.
3. **Determine Result for Current Test Case**:
   - If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `0` is appended to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, `tmp` counts how many elements in `cx` fall between `bx` and `ax` inclusive. The value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` is then appended to `r`.

Given the loop runs `t` times, the final state will be the accumulated results in the list `r` after processing all `t` test cases.

### Output State after All Iterations

Since the problem doesn't specify the exact constraints for each test case, we can generalize the final state based on the loop's behavior:

- **`r`**: This list will contain `t` elements, each representing the result of one test case. Each element is either `0` (if `bx >= ax`) or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` (otherwise).

Thus, the final output state after all iterations is:

Output State: **`r` contains `t` integers, each derived from the constraints of one test case as described above.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `r` will have `t` elements, where each element is the result of evaluating the constraints for one test case according to the rules provided in the loop.
