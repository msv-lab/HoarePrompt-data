The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common placeholder for a loop variable when its value is not used inside the loop), and `n` which determines the number of iterations. Since `_` is just a placeholder, it does not need to be adjusted. The loop will continue as long as the number of iterations is less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, the loop has already completed one iteration. Therefore, to prepare for the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop progresses.

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `r` is an empty list
- `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 3, otherwise `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`
- `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is 1 or 3, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and `x`
- `bx` is `x` if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1
- `a` and `x` are the integers read from the input where `a` ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9

Since the loop variable `_` does not affect the state, and `n` determines the number of iterations, we don't need to change `t`, `r`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`, `a`, or `x`. The only thing that changes is the implicit iteration count, which is represented by the loop itself.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `r` is an empty list; `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 3, otherwise `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`; `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is 1 or 3, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and `x`; `bx` is `x` if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1; `a` and `x` are the integers read from the input where `a` ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9**
