The code snippet `ax = min(x, ax)` updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `x`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is the first integer from the input.
- `x` is the second integer from the input.
- `n` is now `n - 1`.
- `r` includes the new element `1000000009`.
- `bx` is `max(x, -1)` if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1.
- `ax` is `1000000007` if `a` is 1, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `1000000007` if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` remains `1000000007`.
- `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `x`.

After executing `ax = min(x, ax)`, the value of `ax` will be updated to the minimum of `x` and its previous value.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `n` is now `n - 1`, `r` includes the new element `1000000009`, `bx` is `max(x, -1)` if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1, `ax` is `min(x, 1000000007)` if `a` is 1, otherwise `ax` is `min(x, min(x, 1000000007))` if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` is `min(x, 1000000007)`, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `x`.**

In simpler terms:
- `a` and `x` remain unchanged.
- `n` is still `n - 1`.
- `r` still includes `1000000009`.
- `bx` remains `max(x, -1)` if `a` is 1, otherwise `-1`.
- `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and its previous value.
- `cx` remains an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise a set containing `x`.
