The code snippet initializes an empty set named `cx`. This action does not affect the values of `bx`, `ax`, `r`, or `n`. Therefore, the values of `bx`, `ax`, `r`, and `n` remain unchanged. The only change is that `cx` is now an empty set.

Output State: **`bx` and `ax` are integers. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` has an additional element `0` appended to it. Otherwise, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, and `r` includes the new element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. `n` is an input integer. `cx` is an empty set.**
