Output State: **`a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` contains `{x}`, `n` is greater than 1, `r` includes the element 1000000009.**

Explanation: The value of `bx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `x`. If `a` was initially 1, `bx` was `-1`, so `bx` now becomes `max(x, -1)`. If `a` was not 1, `bx` was already `-1`, and it remains `-1` unless `x` is greater than `-1`, in which case `bx` becomes `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
