The given code snippet initializes a variable `tmp` to `0`. This does not affect the values of `bx`, `ax`, `cx`, `n`, or `r`. The only change is the introduction of `tmp` with a value of `0`.

Output State: **`bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was `1`, `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was `2`, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` values encountered when `a` was `3`, `n` is `0`, `r` includes the new element `1000000009`, `tmp` is `0`, and `bx` is less than `ax`.**
