Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, and `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D"; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = input()
    if n % 2 == 0:
        results.append('no')
    elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
        results.append('yes')
    else:
        results.append('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `arr` is the string provided as input. If `n` is even, `results` is a list containing the string `'no'`. If `n` is odd, `results` is a list containing the string `'yes'` if `arr` has more 'U' characters than 'D' characters, or `'no'` if `arr` has fewer or equal 'U' characters compared to 'D' characters.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `arr` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `n` is even, `results` is a list containing either `['no', 'no']` or `['yes', 'no']` depending on the initial value of `results`. If `n` is odd, `results` has `'yes'` appended to it if `arr` has more 'U' characters than 'D' characters, otherwise `'no'` is appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `arr` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `n` is even, `results` includes `'no'` appended to it. If `n` is odd, `results` contains `'yes'` appended to it if the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D'; otherwise, `results` contains `'no'` appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
