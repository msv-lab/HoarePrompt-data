Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `arr` is the new input string. `results` is a list that contains `'yes'` appended to its previous content if `arr` has more 'U' characters than 'D' characters, otherwise `'no'` is appended to its previous content. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
