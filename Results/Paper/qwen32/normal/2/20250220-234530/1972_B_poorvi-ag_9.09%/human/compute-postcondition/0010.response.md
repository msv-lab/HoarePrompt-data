Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `results` is an empty list, `arr` is the string provided as input, and `n` is odd. Additionally, the number of 'U's in `arr` is less than or equal to the number of 'D's in `arr`.**
