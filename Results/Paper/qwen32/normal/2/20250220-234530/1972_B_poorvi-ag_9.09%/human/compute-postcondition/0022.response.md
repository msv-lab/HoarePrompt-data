The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was incremented by 1 from its previous value. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 again from its current value.

No other variables in the loop head (`t`) need to be adjusted because `t` remains constant throughout the loop.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `arr` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `results` is a list that has been modified according to the conditions specified.** 

Since we are only adjusting the state of `i` in the loop head, the specific state of `results` does not need to be detailed further unless required by the loop head, which it is not.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `arr` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
