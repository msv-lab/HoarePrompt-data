Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, the function returns the final position after processing the string `s`, where "U" indicates moving up by 1 unit and "D" indicates moving down by 1 unit.**
