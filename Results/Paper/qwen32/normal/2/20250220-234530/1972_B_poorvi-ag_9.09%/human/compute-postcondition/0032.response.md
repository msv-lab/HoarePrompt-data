To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, let's carefully analyze the initial state provided:

- `results` is a list of length `t` where `t` must be greater than 0, and each element is either `'yes'` or `'no'`.

However, the variable `i` is not mentioned in the initial state. This means that the value of `i` is not explicitly defined or initialized based on the information provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `i` from the given precondition alone.

Since the value of `i` is not specified, we cannot provide a precise numerical or descriptive value for it. The most accurate description would be to state that the output will be whatever value `i` holds at the time of execution, but since it is not defined, we cannot specify that value.

Given this analysis, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **i (where i is an undefined variable)**
