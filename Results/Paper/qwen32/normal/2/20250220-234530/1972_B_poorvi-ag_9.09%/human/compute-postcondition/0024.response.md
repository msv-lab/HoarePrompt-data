The code snippet `arr = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `arr`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `arr` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
