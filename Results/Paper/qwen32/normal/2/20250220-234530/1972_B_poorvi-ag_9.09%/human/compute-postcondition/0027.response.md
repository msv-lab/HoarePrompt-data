The code snippet appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. This means that `results` now contains the string `'no'` as its last element. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `arr` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `results` contains the string `'no'` as its last element.**
