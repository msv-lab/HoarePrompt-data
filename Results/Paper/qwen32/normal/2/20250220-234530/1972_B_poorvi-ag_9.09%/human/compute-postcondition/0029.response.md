Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `arr` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `n` is even, `results` includes `'no'` appended to it. If `n` is odd, `results` contains `'yes'` appended to it if the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D'; otherwise, `results` contains `'no'` appended to it.**
