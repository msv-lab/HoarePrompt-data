Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `arr` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `results` contains 'yes' appended to it.**

Explanation: The value of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `arr` remains unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1. The list `results` now includes an additional element 'yes'.
