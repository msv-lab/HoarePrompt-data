Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `arr` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D', `results` contains 'yes' appended to it. Otherwise, `results` contains 'no' as its last element.**
