The given code snippet updates the list `T` by mapping the integers from the split string `line`. This means `T` will now contain the integers from the new input string `line`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 500; `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the string `line`; `a` is `[1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]), ..., (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], 1000 - T[0], 1000]`; `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` joined by spaces; `line` is the new input string.**

In natural language: The value of `T` is updated to be a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the new input string `line`. All other variables remain unchanged.
