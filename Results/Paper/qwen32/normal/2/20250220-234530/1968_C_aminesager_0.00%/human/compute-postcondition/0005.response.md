The code snippet converts the string `line` into a list of integers and assigns it to the variable `T`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the integer value provided by user input; `x` is a list of n-1 integers where each element x_i satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500; `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the string `line`.**
