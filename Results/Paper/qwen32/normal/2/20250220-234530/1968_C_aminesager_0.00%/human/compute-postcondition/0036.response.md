The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the user input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `result`, or `t`.

Output State: **`a` contains `n` elements starting with the last element of the original `a` and each subsequent element is the previous element plus the corresponding element in `T` (in reverse order); `result` is a space-separated string of these elements; `t` is `False`; `n` is an input integer.**
