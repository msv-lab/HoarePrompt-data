#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers where each element x_i satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        line = input('')

        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])
        
        a = a[::-1]

    #State: 
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. It computes a new list based on these inputs and prints the list for each test case.
