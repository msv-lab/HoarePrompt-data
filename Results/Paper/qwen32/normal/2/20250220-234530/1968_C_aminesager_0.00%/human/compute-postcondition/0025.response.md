To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n-1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `n` must be greater than 1.
- A new element is appended to the list `a`, which is the result of `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`.

Let's analyze the state adjustments required:

1. **Variable `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was used to compute the new element for `a`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - `n` remains unchanged as it defines the upper limit of the loop.

Since the problem specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, we only need to adjust `i`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value (let's call it `i_prev`).
- Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.
- Given that the previous iteration ended with `i = i_prev`, the next iteration should start with `i = i_prev + 1`.

### Conclusion:
- `n` remains the same because it is the loop boundary.
- `i` is incremented by 1 to start the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1**.

If we assume `i` was 1 at the start of the first iteration (as per the loop definition), then after the first iteration, `i` would be 2, and so on. Thus, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

For the sake of a concrete example, if `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3.

So, the final state can be generalized as:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1**.

If we need a specific example:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 3** (assuming `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration).
