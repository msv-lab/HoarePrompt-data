The code snippet provided is:

```python
n = int(input())
```

This line of code reassigns the variable `n` to the integer value obtained from user input. The initial state specifies that `n` was already an integer between 2 and 500. After executing this line, `n` will take on whatever integer value is provided by the user input, which could be any integer (not necessarily within the original range unless the user provides a value within that range).

The variables `t` and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the integer value provided by user input; `x` is a list of n-1 integers where each element x_i satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500.**
