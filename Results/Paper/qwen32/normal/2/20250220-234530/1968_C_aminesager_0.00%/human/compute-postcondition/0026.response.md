To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

Initial State: `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 3
```
a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])
```

The code appends a new element to list `a`. This new element is the difference between `a[i - 1]` and `T[i - 1]`.

Given `i` is 3, the operation effectively does:
- `a.append(a[2] - T[2])`

This means the third element of list `a` (index 2) is subtracted from the third element of list `T` (index 2), and the result is appended to the end of list `a`.

Since the exact values of `a[2]` and `T[2]` are not specified, we can only express the new element in terms of these variables.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` must still be greater than 1 (precondition remains).
- `i` is still 3 (unchanged).
- `a` now has one additional element, which is `a[2] - T[2]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 3, `a` has an additional element equal to `a[2] - T[2]`.**
