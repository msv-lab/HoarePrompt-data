### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and its behavior to determine if it correctly constructs a k-level permutation as per the problem description.

#### Code Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes a list `permutation` of size `n` with zeros.
   - It also initializes `idx`, `idx_v`, and `curr_v` to 1. However, `idx` and `idx_v` are not used in the function.

2. **Filling the Permutation**:
   - The function iterates over `i` from 0 to `k-1`.
   - For each `i`, it fills the permutation at indices `multiples_of_k_plus_i` (which starts at `i` and increments by `k` each time) with the current value `curr_v` and then increments `curr_v`.

3. **Printing the Result**:
   - After filling the permutation, it joins the elements into a string separated by spaces and prints the result.

#### Verification Against Requirements

The goal is to create a k-level permutation where the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any k-length contiguous subarray is at most 1.

Let's consider how the current implementation attempts to achieve this:

- The approach fills the permutation in a pattern where every `k`-th position starting from `i` (for `i` from 0 to `k-1`) is filled sequentially with increasing numbers.
- This means the permutation will look something like this for `n=10` and `k=4`:
  - Starting from index 0: 1, 5, 9, ...
  - Starting from index 1: 2, 6, 10, ...
  - Starting from index 2: 3, 7, 11, ...
  - Starting from index 3: 4, 8, 12, ...

However, this pattern does not necessarily ensure that the sums of any k-length contiguous subarrays will differ by no more than 1. For instance, in the example provided, the sums of the subarrays might vary significantly depending on the distribution of numbers.

### Detailed Example Analysis

Let's take the example given in the problem statement for `n=10` and `k=4`:

- The function will fill the permutation as follows:
  - Index 0: 1, 5, 9
  - Index 1: 2, 6, 10
  - Index 2: 3, 7, 11
  - Index 3: 4, 8, 12

This results in the permutation: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`

Now let's calculate the sums of all k-length (4-length) contiguous subarrays:
- Sum of `[1, 2, 3, 4]` is 10
- Sum of `[2, 3, 4, 5]` is 14
- Sum of `[3, 4, 5, 6]` is 18
- Sum of `[4, 5, 6, 7]` is 22
- Sum of `[5, 6, 7, 8]` is 26
- Sum of `[6, 7, 8, 9]` is 30
- Sum of `[7, 8, 9, 10]` is 34

Clearly, the sums vary significantly, and the difference between the maximum and minimum sums is 24 (34 - 10), which is much greater than 1. Therefore, this permutation is not k-level.

### Conclusion

Given the pattern of filling the permutation, it is not guaranteed that the sums of all k-length contiguous subarrays will have a difference of at most 1. Therefore, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
