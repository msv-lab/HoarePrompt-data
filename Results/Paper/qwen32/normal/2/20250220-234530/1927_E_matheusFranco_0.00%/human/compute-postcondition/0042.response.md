The given Python code snippet modifies the `permutation` list by setting the value at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` to `curr_v`. Let's determine the new state of the `permutation` list and other relevant variables.

Given:
- `n` must be greater than 4
- `k` is even and `2 <= k <= n`
- `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with specific elements set to particular values
- `idx` is 0
- `idx_v` is 1
- `curr_v` is `floor((n-1)/k) + floor((n-2)/k) + 4`
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `k + 2`
- `i` is 2

The line of code `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v` sets the value at index `k + 2` of the `permutation` list to `curr_v`.

Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `k + 2`, and `curr_v` is `floor((n-1)/k) + floor((n-2)/k) + 4`, the value at index `k + 2` in the `permutation` list will be updated to `floor((n-1)/k) + floor((n-2)/k) + 4`.

No other variables are modified by this line of code, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `k` is even, `2 <= k <= n`, `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with elements at indices `0, k, 2*k, ..., floor((n-1)/k)*k` set to `1, 2, 3, ..., floor((n-1)/k)+1`, elements at indices `1, 1+k, 1+2*k, ..., 1+floor((n-2)/k)*k` set to `floor((n-1)/k) + 2, floor((n-1)/k) + 3, ..., floor((n-1)/k) + floor((n-2)/k) + 2`, except the element at index 2 which is now `floor((n-1)/k) + floor((n-2)/k) + 3`, and the element at index `k + 2` is now `floor((n-1)/k) + floor((n-2)/k) + 4`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `floor((n-1)/k) + floor((n-2)/k) + 4`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `k + 2`; `i` is 2**.
