To determine the output state, we need to know what `func_1()` does. Since the function definition is not provided, we cannot determine the exact changes to the variables. However, based on the given information, we can assume that `func_1()` might modify some variables or perform some operations, but since no specific details are provided, we'll assume it doesn't affect the variable `t` directly unless specified.

Given that `t` must be greater than 0 initially, and without any specific operations on `t` within `func_1()`, we can infer that `t` remains unchanged.

If `func_1()` returns a value, we would need to know what that value is to include it in the output state. Since no return value is mentioned, we'll assume it doesn't return anything explicitly.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with respect to `t`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0**.
