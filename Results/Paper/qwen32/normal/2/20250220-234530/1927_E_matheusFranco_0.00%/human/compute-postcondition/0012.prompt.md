You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters in its signature. It reads an integer t from the input, which represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k, where n is the length of the desired permutation and k is the level of the permutation. It is guaranteed that k is even and 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function then calls `func_1()` t times to process each test case.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        func_1()
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: t is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it reads an integer `t` from the input, which indicates the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the length of the desired permutation and `k` is the level of the permutation (guaranteed to be even and within the range 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5). The function then processes each test case by calling `func_1()` `t` times. There is no specified return value for `func_2`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
