Functionality: **The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it reads an integer `t` from the input, which indicates the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the length of the desired permutation and `k` is the level of the permutation (guaranteed to be even and within the range 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5). The function then processes each test case by calling `func_1()` `t` times. There is no specified return value for `func_2`.**
