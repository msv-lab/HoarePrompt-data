### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program using the provided annotations and the problem description to determine if the program correctly constructs a k-level permutation.

#### Code Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes a list `permutation` of size `n` with zeros.
   - Variables `idx`, `idx_v`, and `curr_v` are initialized. However, `idx` and `idx_v` are not used in the function.

2. **Filling the Permutation**:
   - The function iterates over `i` from 0 to `k-1`.
   - For each `i`, it fills the permutation at indices `multiples_of_k_plus_i` (which starts at `i` and increments by `k` each time) with the current value `curr_v` and then increments `curr_v`.

3. **Printing the Result**:
   - After filling the permutation, it joins the elements into a string separated by spaces and prints the result.

#### Verification Against Requirements:

The goal is to create a k-level permutation where the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any k-length contiguous subarray is at most 1.

Let's consider the pattern of filling the permutation:
- For `n=10` and `k=4`, the permutation will be filled as follows:
  - Starting from index 0: 1, 5, 9, ...
  - Starting from index 1: 2, 6, 10, ...
  - Starting from index 2: 3, 7, 11, ...
  - Starting from index 3: 4, 8, 12, ...

This results in a permutation like: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.

Now, let's calculate the sums of all k-length contiguous subarrays:
- For `k=4`, the subarrays and their sums are:
  - `[1, 2, 3, 4]` -> Sum = 10
  - `[2, 3, 4, 5]` -> Sum = 14
  - `[3, 4, 5, 6]` -> Sum = 18
  - `[4, 5, 6, 7]` -> Sum = 22
  - `[5, 6, 7, 8]` -> Sum = 26
  - `[6, 7, 8, 9]` -> Sum = 30
  - `[7, 8, 9, 10]` -> Sum = 34

Clearly, the sums of these subarrays vary significantly, and the difference between the maximum and minimum sums is not at most 1. This indicates that the current implementation does not produce a k-level permutation.

#### Annotations Evaluation:

The annotations provided describe the state of the program at key points, but they do not address the critical issue of whether the resulting permutation meets the k-level condition. The annotations focus on the filling pattern but do not verify the sums of the k-length subarrays.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The sums of k-length contiguous subarrays do not meet the requirement that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums is at most 1.

**Final: False**
