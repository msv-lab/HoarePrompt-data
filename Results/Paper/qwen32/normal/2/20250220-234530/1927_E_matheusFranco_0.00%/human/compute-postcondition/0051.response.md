The code snippet converts the list `permutation` into a string where each element is separated by a space and assigns this string to the variable `result`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `idx`, `idx_v`, `curr_v`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, where `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of `n` integers from 1 to `n` in a specific order determined by the loop; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `n + 1`; `result` is a string that is the space-separated representation of the list `permutation`.**
