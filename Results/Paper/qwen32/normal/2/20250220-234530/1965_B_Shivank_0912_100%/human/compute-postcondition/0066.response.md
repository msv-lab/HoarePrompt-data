Postcondition: **`n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `tc` is `tc + 1`, `t` remains the same, `i` is `i_final` where `1 << (i_final + 1)` is the smallest power of 2 greater than `k`. If `j` was not equal to `i`, `ans` is updated to include `1 << j`. `j` is incremented by 1.**
