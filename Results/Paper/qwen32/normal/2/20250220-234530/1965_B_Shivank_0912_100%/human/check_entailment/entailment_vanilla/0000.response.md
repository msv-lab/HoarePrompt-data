Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
- The sequence must satisfy two conditions:
  1. There should be no subsequence of `a` that sums to `k`.
  2. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Determination of `i`:**
   - The variable `i` is determined by finding the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`. This is done using a while loop that increments `i` until `1 << (i + 1)` (which is `2^(i+1)`) exceeds `k`.

3. **Constructing the Sequence `ans`:**
   - The sequence `ans` is initialized with three elements:
     - `k - (1 << i)`: This ensures that we have a number slightly less than `k` which can help in constructing sums around `k`.
     - `k + 1`: This ensures that we can construct sums greater than `k`.
     - `k + 1 + (1 << i)`: This adds another element that is significantly larger than `k` to help in constructing larger sums.
   - The program then appends powers of 2 (`1 << j` where `j` ranges from 0 to 19) to `ans`, except for the power of 2 corresponding to `i` (since `1 << i` is already used in the initial elements).

4. **Output:**
   - The length of the sequence `ans` is printed.
   - The elements of `ans` are printed.

### Verification of Conditions:

- **Condition 1: No Subsequence Sums to `k`:**
  - The construction of `ans` avoids having any combination of its elements sum exactly to `k`. This is ensured by carefully selecting the initial elements and excluding `1 << i` from the subsequent additions of powers of 2.

- **Condition 2: All Sums from 1 to `n` (except `k`) Can Be Formed:**
  - By including all powers of 2 up to `2^19` (except `2^i`), the sequence can form any sum that can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2, excluding `2^i`. Given the nature of binary representation, this allows forming a wide range of sums.
  - The inclusion of `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)` further aids in forming sums close to `k` and beyond, ensuring that all sums from 1 to `n` (except `k`) can be formed.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program correctly constructs a sequence that meets both conditions specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
