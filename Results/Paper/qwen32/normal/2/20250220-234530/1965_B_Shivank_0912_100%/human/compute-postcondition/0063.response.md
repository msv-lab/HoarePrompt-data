Postcondition: **`n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `tc` is `tc + 1`, `t` remains the same, `i` is `i_final` where `1 << (i_final + 1)` is the smallest power of 2 greater than `k`, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` if `j` equals `i`; otherwise, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j]` and `j` is not equal to `i`.**
