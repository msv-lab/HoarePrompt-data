The code appends `1 << j` to the list `ans`. This means the list `ans` now includes an additional element which is `2^j`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `k` is the second input integer.
- `tc` is incremented by 1.
- `t` remains the same.
- `i` is `i_final` where `1 << (i_final + 1)` is the smallest power of 2 greater than `k`.
- `ans` is initially `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`.
- `j` is not equal to `i`.

After executing the code snippet `ans.append(1 << j)`, the list `ans` will have an additional element `2^j`.

Therefore, the updated `ans` will be `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j]`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `tc` is `tc + 1`, `t` remains the same, `i` is `i_final` where `1 << (i_final + 1)` is the smallest power of 2 greater than `k`, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j]`, and `j` is not equal to `i`.**
