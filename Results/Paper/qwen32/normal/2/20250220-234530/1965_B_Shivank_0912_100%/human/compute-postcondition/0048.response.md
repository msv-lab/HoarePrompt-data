To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the `ans` list step-by-step.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variables `n` and `k`:**
   - `n` and `k` are input integers. Their specific values are not provided, but they influence the construction of the `ans` list.

2. **Variable `tc`:**
   - `tc` is incremented by 1, but it does not affect the `ans` list directly.

3. **Variable `t`:**
   - `t` remains the same, but it also does not affect the `ans` list directly.

4. **Variable `i_final`:**
   - `i_final` is the largest integer such that \(2^{(i_{\text{final}} + 1)} \leq k\).
   - This means \(2^{i_{\text{final}}} \leq \frac{k}{2}\).

5. **List Construction:**
   - The list `ans` is constructed as follows:
     - First three elements: `[k - (1 << i_{\text{final}}), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i_{\text{final}})]`
     - Powers of 2 from \(2^0\) up to \(2^{19}\), excluding \(2^{i_{\text{final}}}\).

### Step-by-Step Construction of `ans`:

1. **Determine `i_final`:**
   - Calculate the largest integer \(i_{\text{final}}\) such that \(2^{(i_{\text{final}} + 1)} \leq k\).
   - This can be done using logarithms or by trial and error.

2. **Construct the List:**
   - Start with the first three elements:
     - `k - (1 << i_{\text{final}})` which is \(k - 2^{i_{\text{final}}}\)
     - `k + 1`
     - `k + 1 + (1 << i_{\text{final}})` which is \(k + 1 + 2^{i_{\text{final}}}\)
   - Followed by powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{19}\), excluding \(2^{i_{\text{final}}}\).

### Example Calculation:

Let's assume `k = 20` for illustration purposes.

1. **Determine `i_final`:**
   - \(2^{(i_{\text{final}} + 1)} \leq 20\)
   - Possible values: \(2^1 = 2\), \(2^2 = 4\), \(2^3 = 8\), \(2^4 = 16\), \(2^5 = 32\) (too large)
   - Therefore, \(i_{\text{final}} = 3\).

2. **Construct the List:**
   - First three elements:
     - \(k - 2^{i_{\text{final}}} = 20 - 2^3 = 20 - 8 = 12\)
     - \(k + 1 = 20 + 1 = 21\)
     - \(k + 1 + 2^{i_{\text{final}}} = 20 + 1 + 2^3 = 20 + 1 + 8 = 29\)
   - Powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{19}\), excluding \(2^3\):
     - \(2^0 = 1\), \(2^1 = 2\), \(2^2 = 4\), \(2^4 = 16\), \(2^5 = 32\), ..., \(2^{19} = 524288\)

### Final List `ans`:

\[ \text{ans} = [12, 21, 29, 1, 2, 4, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288] \]

### Output:

Output: **12 21 29 1 2 4 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 (where ans is constructed based on the value of k and i_final)**

Note: The exact numerical values depend on the input `k`. The description above provides a general form based on the given conditions.
