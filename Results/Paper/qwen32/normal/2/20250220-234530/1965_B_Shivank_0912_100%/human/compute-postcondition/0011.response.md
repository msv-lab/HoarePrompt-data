Given the initial state:
```
ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
```

The code snippet does not modify the variable `ans` or any other variables directly. It simply defines the list `ans` based on the expressions provided.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`**.
