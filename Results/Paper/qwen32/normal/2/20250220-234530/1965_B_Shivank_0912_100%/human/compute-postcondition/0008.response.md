To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
    # the loop body is omit
```

This condition translates to checking if \(2^{(i + 1)} \leq k\).

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
- `n` is an integer read from the input
- `k` must be at least 4
- `i` is 2

Let's evaluate the condition \(2^{(i + 1)} \leq k\) with `i` being 2:

\[ 2^{(2 + 1)} = 2^3 = 8 \]

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition \(8 \leq k\) must hold true.

Since `k` must be at least 4, we need to adjust `k` to ensure that it is at least 8 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state needs to be modified such that `k` is at least 8.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an integer read from the input; `k` must be at least 8; `i` is 2**
