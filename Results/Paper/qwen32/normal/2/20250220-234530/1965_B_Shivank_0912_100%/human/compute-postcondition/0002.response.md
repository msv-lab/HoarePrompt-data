The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state only specifies that `t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000. Since `n` and `k` are newly introduced and assigned values from the input, they are not part of the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.**
