Output State: **`ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j, 1 << (j + 1)]` and `j` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The list `ans` originally contained four elements if `j` was not equal to `i`, or three elements if `j` was equal to `i`. After appending `1 << j` to `ans`, the list now contains one additional element, making it five elements long. Additionally, the variable `j` is incremented by 1.
