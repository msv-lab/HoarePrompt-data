The function processes `t` test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a list of integers starting with the length of the list, followed by specific values derived from `k`. The values include `k - 2^i`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + 2^i`, and `2^j` for `j` not equal to `i`, where `i` is the largest integer such that `2^(i+1)` is less than or equal to `k`.
