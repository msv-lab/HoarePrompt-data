Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `k` must be at least 8, `tc` is `tc + 1`, `t` remains the same, the list contains `[k - (1 << i_final), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i_final), 1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(i_final - 1), 2^(i_final + 1), ..., 524288]`, `i` is 3, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i_final), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i_final), 1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(i_final - 1), 2^(i_final + 1), ..., 2^19]`**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, changing from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
