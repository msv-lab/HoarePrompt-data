To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case and accumulates results based on the provided inputs.

### Loop Analysis

For each test case (`tc` ranging from 0 to `t-1`):
1. **Inputs**: Read `n` and `k`.
2. **Determine `i`**: Find the largest integer `i` such that `2^(i+1) <= k`.
3. **Construct `ans` List**:
   - Start with `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`.
   - Append `1 << j` for all `j` from 0 to 19 except `i`.
4. **Output**: Print the length of `ans` and then the elements of `ans`.

### Final Output State

After processing all `t` test cases, the final state will be the accumulation of outputs for each test case. Each test case will produce its own `ans` list and corresponding length, printed separately.

### Format of Output State

Since the problem asks for the final output state in a specific format, we need to describe it clearly:

- **Number of Test Cases Processed**: `t`
- **For Each Test Case**: 
  - Compute `i` as the largest integer such that `2^(i+1) <= k`.
  - Construct `ans` list as described.
  - Print the length of `ans` followed by the elements of `ans`.

### Final Output State Description

The final output state consists of `t` blocks of output, each corresponding to one test case. Each block starts with the length of the `ans` list, followed by the elements of the `ans` list.

### Example

If `t = 2`, and the inputs are:
- First test case: `n = 10`, `k = 5`
- Second test case: `n = 15`, `k = 10`

The output would be:
```

3 6 7 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288

8 11 12 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288
```

### Final Answer

Output State: **The final output state consists of `t` blocks, each starting with the length of the `ans` list followed by the elements of the `ans` list, computed for each test case as described.**

This means that for each test case, the program computes the appropriate `ans` list based on the given `k` and prints the length and elements of that list. The state of the program after all iterations is simply the sequence of these outputs for each test case.
