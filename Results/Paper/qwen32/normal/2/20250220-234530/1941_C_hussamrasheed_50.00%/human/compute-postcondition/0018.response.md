The code snippet updates the value of `m` to be the count of the substring 'map' in the string `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `p`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the newly input integer; `s` is the newly input string; `m` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`; `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the modified `s`; `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1**.
