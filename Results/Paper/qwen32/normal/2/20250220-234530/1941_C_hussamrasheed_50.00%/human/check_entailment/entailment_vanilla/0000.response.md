Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string `s` to make it beautiful.
- A string is considered ugly if it contains the substrings "pie" or "map".
- The goal is to count how many times these substrings appear and remove them to make the string beautiful.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        m = s.count('map')
        s = s.replace('map', '')
        p = s.count('pie')
        print(m + p)
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` (though `n` is not used).
   - It then reads the string `s`.

2. **Counting Substrings:**
   - The program counts the occurrences of the substring "map" in `s` using `s.count('map')` and stores this count in `m`.
   - It then removes all occurrences of "map" from `s` using `s.replace('map', '')`.
   - After removing "map", it counts the occurrences of the substring "pie" in the modified string `s` using `s.count('pie')` and stores this count in `p`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the sum of `m` and `p`, which represents the total number of "map" and "pie" substrings found in the original string `s`.

### Issues with the Program:

- **Incorrect Approach:** The program assumes that simply counting the occurrences of "map" and "pie" gives the minimum number of deletions required. However, this is not necessarily true because the removal of one substring might affect the presence of another.
- **Overlapping Substrings:** The program does not handle overlapping substrings correctly. For example, in the string "mpieamap", the program would count "map" once and "pie" once, but removing one character could eliminate both substrings simultaneously.
- **Minimum Deletions:** The program does not attempt to find the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie". It only counts them.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not account for overlapping substrings and does not find the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
