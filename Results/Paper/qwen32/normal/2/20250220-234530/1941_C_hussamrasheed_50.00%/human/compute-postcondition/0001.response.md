To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `t`:** This variable determines how many times the loop will iterate. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be at least 1. Given the problem statement, `t` is already constrained to be between 1 and 10^4, inclusive. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t`.

2. **Variable `i`:** This variable is the loop counter and is automatically initialized to 0 when the loop starts. It increments by 1 after each iteration. Since `i` is managed by the `range(t)` function, there's no need to manually set its initial value.

Since `t` is already guaranteed to be within the valid range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and `i` is correctly handled by the `range` function, no additional adjustments are necessary for these variables.

Thus, the state before the loop starts remains as given, with the understanding that `t` is already within the required range.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
