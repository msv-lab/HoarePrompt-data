Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string `s` and prints their sum. However, this approach does not necessarily give the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. 

Consider the following counterexample:

Input:
```
1
6
appiep
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Explanation:
- The string "appiep" contains the substring "pie". To make it beautiful, we only need to remove one character ('p' at index 3), resulting in "appep", which does not contain "pie" or "map".

However, the provided program would output `1` because it counts one occurrence of "pie" and no occurrences of "map", but it does not consider that removing a single character could break both substrings more efficiently.

To correctly solve this problem, a dynamic programming approach or another method to find the longest subsequence without "map" or "pie" should be used. The current solution fails to provide the minimum number of deletions in some cases.
