### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the input string `s` and then printing the total count of these occurrences for each test case. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.

2. **Counting Substrings**:
   - First, it counts the number of times "map" appears in the string `s` and stores this count in the variable `m`.
   - Then, it removes all occurrences of "map" from the string `s` using the `replace` method.
   - After removing "map", it counts the number of times "pie" appears in the modified string `s` and stores this count in the variable `p`.

3. **Output**: The program prints the sum of `m` and `p` for each test case, which represents the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

However, there is a flaw in this approach. Simply counting the occurrences of "map" and "pie" and summing them does not necessarily give the minimum number of deletions required. This is because removing characters to eliminate one occurrence of "map" might also affect the count of "pie" and vice versa.

For example, consider the string "mpieam". The program would count 1 "map" and 1 "pie", resulting in a total of 2 deletions. However, removing just the 'm' at the beginning would suffice to make the string beautiful, requiring only 1 deletion.

Thus, the current implementation does not guarantee the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

### Correctness: **False**
