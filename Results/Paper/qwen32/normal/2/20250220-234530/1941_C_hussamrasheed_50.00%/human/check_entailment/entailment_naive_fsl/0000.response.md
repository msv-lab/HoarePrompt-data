Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle overlapping occurrences of the substrings "pie" and "map". It simply counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" after removing all "map" occurrences, which does not account for the fact that removing characters from "map" might create new "pie" substrings or vice versa. 

Let's consider a test case:

**Input:**
```
1
7
mpiepam
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- We can remove the 'm' at index 0 and the 'a' at index 5 to get "piep", which does not contain "pie" or "map".

However, the given program would output `2` because it counts the "map" at indices 3-5 and the "pie" at indices 1-3, but it does not correctly handle the removal of characters that could affect other substrings.

**Actual Output of Provided Program:**
```
2
```

While this output happens to be correct for this specific case, the program does not guarantee correctness for all cases due to the issue mentioned above. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

To fix this, we need a more sophisticated approach that considers the effect of removing characters on both "map" and "pie" substrings simultaneously.
