Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; All test cases have been processed; `i` is equal to `t`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations; No more input values for `n` or `s` are read; The final results for each test case (sum of `m` and `p`) have been printed.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the loop variable `i` will have reached the value of `t`, meaning all test cases have been processed. No further input values for `n` or `s` will be read, and the program will have printed the sum of `m` (number of 'map' occurrences) and `p` (number of 'pie' occurrences) for each test case.
