The code updates the value of `p` to be the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in the modified string `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `s` is the new input string with all 'map' substrings removed; `m` is 0; `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the modified `s`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
