The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (let's assume it was `i-1`), and `t` is a constant input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

To proceed to the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the original string with all occurrences of 'map' removed; `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`; `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`; `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since `i` is the only variable we can adjust, and it needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the original string with all occurrences of 'map' removed; `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`; `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`; `i` is `i + 1`**.

Given that we don't know the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can represent the new state as:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the original string with all occurrences of 'map' removed; `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`; `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`; `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1**.

For clarity, if `i` was 0 at the start of the first iteration, then at the start of the second iteration, `i` would be 1. If `i` was 1 at the end of the first iteration, then at the start of the second iteration, `i` would be 2, and so on.

So, the final state representation is:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the original string with all occurrences of 'map' removed; `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`; `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`; `i` is `i + 1`**.
