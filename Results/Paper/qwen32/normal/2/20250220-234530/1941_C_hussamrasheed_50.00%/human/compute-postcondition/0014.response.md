Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step-by-step to determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t`: An input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable is mentioned but not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
- `n`: Another input integer. This variable is also mentioned but not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
- `s`: A new input string with all 'map' substrings removed. This means any occurrence of 'map' in the original string has been deleted.
- `m`: Initialized to 0. This variable is not modified anywhere in the provided code snippet.
- `p`: The number of times 'pie' appears in the modified string `s`. This variable holds the count of the substring 'pie' after all 'map' substrings have been removed from the original string.
- `i`: Mentioned as `i = i + 1`, but since `i` is not defined or used elsewhere in the provided code snippet, this operation does not affect the output.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code snippet contains only one line:
```python
print(m + p)
```

### Variable Values:
- `m` is explicitly initialized to 0.
- `p` is the count of the substring 'pie' in the modified string `s`.

### Calculation:
The expression `m + p` simplifies to `0 + p`, which is just `p`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement will be the value of `p`, which is the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in the modified string `s` (after all 'map' substrings have been removed).

### Final Output:
Output: **p (where p is the number of times 'pie' appears in the modified string s after removing all 'map' substrings)**
