The code snippet removes all occurrences of the substring 'map' from the string `s`. As a result, the new value of `s` will be the original string with all instances of 'map' deleted. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the original string with all occurrences of 'map' removed; `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`.**
