The code snippet `s = s.replace('map', '')` removes all occurrences of the substring 'map' from the string `s`. This means the new value of `s` will be the original string with all instances of 'map' deleted.

Given the initial state, `m` represents the number of times 'map' appears in the original string `s`. After executing the code, `m` will no longer be relevant to the current state of `s` since all 'map' substrings have been removed. However, `m` remains part of the description as it was before the modification.

The variable `p` is described as the number of times 'pie' appears in the modified `s`. Since the code does not modify anything related to 'pie', `p` remains unchanged.

The variable `i` is incremented by 1, as stated in the initial conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the newly input integer; `s` is the newly input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed; `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`; `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the modified `s`; `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1**.
