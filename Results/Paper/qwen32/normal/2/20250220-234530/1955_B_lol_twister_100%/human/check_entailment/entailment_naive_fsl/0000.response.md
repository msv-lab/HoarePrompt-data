Let's analyze the provided program to ensure it meets the problem description for all potential cases.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to construct a progressive square of size `n x n` using the formula `a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d`.
- Given `n`, `c`, and `d`, we need to check if a given list of `n*n` integers can form such a progressive square.
- The program should output "YES" if the list can form the progressive square, otherwise "NO".

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `c`, and `d`.
   - It then reads the list `l` of `n*n` integers.

2. **Constructing the Progressive Square:**
   - The program finds the minimum value `a` in the list `l`.
   - It constructs the progressive square by calculating `a + k*c + d*h` for each cell `(k, h)` in the `n x n` matrix.
   - These values are stored in the list `li`.

3. **Sorting and Comparison:**
   - Both the constructed list `li` and the input list `l` are sorted.
   - The program checks if the sorted `li` matches the sorted `l`.
   - If they match, it returns "YES", otherwise "NO".

### Potential Issues:
- The program assumes that the minimum value in the list `l` is `a_{1,1}`. This assumption might not always hold true because `a_{1,1}` could be any value, not necessarily the minimum value in the list.
- The program does not verify if the constructed list `li` contains unique values, which is necessary for it to represent a valid progressive square.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 2 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
Here, `a_{1,1}` could be 1, but the program assumes the minimum value is `a_{1,1}`. However, if `a_{1,1}` were 2, the progressive square would be:
```
2 5 8
4 7 10
6 9 12
```
which does not match the input list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`. The program would incorrectly output "YES" because it assumes `a_{1,1}` is 1.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it makes an incorrect assumption about `a_{1,1}` being the minimum value in the list and does not ensure that the constructed list contains unique values.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**.
