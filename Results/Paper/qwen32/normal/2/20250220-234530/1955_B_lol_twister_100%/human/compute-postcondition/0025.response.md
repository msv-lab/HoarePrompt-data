The given code appends a new element to the list `li`. The new element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`. After appending this element, the value of `h` is incremented by 1.

Given the initial state, the only changes are to `li` and `h`. The list `li` now contains one additional element, and `h` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of `n^2` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing `2*n + 3` elements where the first `n` elements are `a + k*c + d*i` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, the next `n` elements are `a + (k+1)*c + d*i` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, and the last three elements are `a + (k+1)*c + d*h`, `a + k * c + d * h`, and `a + k * c + d * (h+1)`, `k` is `k + 1`, `h` is `h + 1`.**
