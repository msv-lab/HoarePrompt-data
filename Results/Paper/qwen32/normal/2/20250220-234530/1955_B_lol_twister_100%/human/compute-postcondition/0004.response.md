The code appends a new element to the list `li`. This new element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`. Given the initial state, we know the following:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500
- `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6
- `l` is a list of `n^2` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9
- `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`
- `li` is an empty list

The variable `li` now contains one element, which is the result of the expression `a + k * c + d * h`. However, the variables `k` and `h` are not defined in the initial state, so their values are unknown. Therefore, the new element in `li` can be expressed as `a + k * c + d * h`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of `n^2` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing one element `a + k * c + d * h`**.
