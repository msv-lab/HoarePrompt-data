### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Understanding the Progressive Square Construction**:
   - The progressive square is defined by its top-left element `a_{1,1}` (which is the smallest element in the list `l`), and two constants `c` and `d`.
   - Each element in the square can be calculated using the formula `a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d`, where `i` and `j` are the row and column indices starting from 1.
   - This means that for a given `n`, `c`, and `d`, there is exactly one possible progressive square.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `c`, and `d`, and the list `l` of `n*n` integers.
   - It then calls `func_1(n, c, d, l)` to determine if the list `l` can form a progressive square with the given parameters.
   
3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It finds the minimum value in the list `l` and assigns it to `a` (which corresponds to `a_{1,1}`).
   - It constructs a new list `li` by calculating each element of the progressive square using the formula `a + k*c + d*h` for `k` and `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.
   - It sorts both `li` and the original list `l`.
   - If the sorted `li` matches the sorted `l`, it returns `'yes'`; otherwise, it returns `'no'`.

4. **Validation**:
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest element in the list as `a_{1,1}`.
   - It accurately constructs the progressive square using the given formula.
   - By sorting both lists and comparing them, it ensures that the provided list `l` contains exactly the same elements as the progressive square.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if the given list of integers can form a progressive square with the specified parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`.

**Correctness:** **True**
