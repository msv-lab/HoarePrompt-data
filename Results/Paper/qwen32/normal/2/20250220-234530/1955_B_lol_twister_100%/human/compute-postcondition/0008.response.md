The code appends a new element to the list `li`. The new element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`, where `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `k` and `c` are integers, and `d` and `h` are also integers with `h` being incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Given the initial state, the only change is that the list `li` now includes one additional element. The values of `t`, `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, `a`, and `h` remain unchanged except for `h` which is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of `n^2` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing elements including `a + k * c + d * h` (with one more element added), `h` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
