Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the integer value of the user input; `s` is the new value of the user input; `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and either `cnt1` is odd or `cnt1` is 1, the behavior of the if part is as described in the if part's postcondition. Otherwise, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1` remain unchanged.**
