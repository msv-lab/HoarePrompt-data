The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from the user, then for each of the next `t` iterations, it reads another integer `n` and a string `s`. It counts the number of '1's in `s` and prints 'YES' if the count is greater than 2 and even, or if there are no consecutive '1's in `s`. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept `start` and `end` as parameters nor does it return any value.
