The given code snippet updates the value of `cnt1` by counting the occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`. This change affects only the variable `cnt1`, while the other variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the new integer value of the user input; `s` is the new value of the user input; `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new `s`.**
