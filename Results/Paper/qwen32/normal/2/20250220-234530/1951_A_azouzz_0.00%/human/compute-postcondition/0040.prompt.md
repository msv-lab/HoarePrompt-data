Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    cnt1 = s.count('1')
    if cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif cnt1 > 2 and (cnt1 % 2 == 1 or cnt1 == 1):
        print('NO')
    elif '11' in s:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the value of the user input, and `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, the current value of `cnt1` remains as it is. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and odd, the current value of `cnt1` remains as it is. Otherwise, either `cnt1` is less than or equal to 2, or `cnt1` is even, and the substring '11' is either present in `s` or not present in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the integer value of the user input; `s` is the new value of the user input; `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, the behavior of the if part is as described in the if part's postcondition. Otherwise, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the new integer value of the user input; `s` is the new value of the user input; `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new `s`. Regardless of the condition `cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 % 2 == 0`, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
