The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `times`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The values of `t`, `n`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `times` is the integer read from the input; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
