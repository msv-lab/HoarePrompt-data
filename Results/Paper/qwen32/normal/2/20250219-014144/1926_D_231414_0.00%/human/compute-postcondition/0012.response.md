Output State: **`data` has at least one element; `s` is the result of `i ^ check`; `i` and `check` retain their original values; `s` is in `dic` and `dic[s]` is decreased by 1; `ans` is decreased by 1.**

This means that the variable `ans` has been decremented by 1, while all other variables retain their original states as described in the initial conditions.
