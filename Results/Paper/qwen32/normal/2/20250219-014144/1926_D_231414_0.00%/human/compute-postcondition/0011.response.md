The code snippet `dic[s] -= 1` decrements the value associated with the key `s` in the dictionary `dic` by 1. Given the initial state, `s` is already a key in `dic` and has a specific value. After executing the code, the value of `dic[s]` will be reduced by 1.

Output State: **`data` has at least one element; `s` is the result of `i ^ check`; `i` and `check` retain their original values; `s` is in `dic` and `dic[s]` is decreased by 1.**
