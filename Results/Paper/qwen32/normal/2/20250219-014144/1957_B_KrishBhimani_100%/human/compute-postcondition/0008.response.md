The code snippet provided initializes the variable `i` to 0. This does not affect any of the other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`). Therefore, the only change in the output state is the introduction of `i` with a value of 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `i` is 0.**
