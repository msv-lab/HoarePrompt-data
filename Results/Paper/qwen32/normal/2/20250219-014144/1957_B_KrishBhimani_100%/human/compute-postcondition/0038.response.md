The given code snippet only initializes an empty list `arr`. None of the other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `ans`, `i`, `temp`) are modified by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State except for the initialization of `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; if `n` equals 1, the program does not alter `t`, `l1`, `n`, or `k`; otherwise, `k0` remains equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing the elements \((1 << i) - 1\), `k - (1 << i) + 1`, and `n - len(ans)` zeros; `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became greater than or equal to `k`; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.**
