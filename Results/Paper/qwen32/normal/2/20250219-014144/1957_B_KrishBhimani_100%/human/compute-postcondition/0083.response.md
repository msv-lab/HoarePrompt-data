The given code snippet modifies the value of `temp` by doubling it. Let's determine the new state of the variables after executing the code.

Given:
- `temp` is initially set to 2 if `temp * 2 < k`, otherwise `temp` is set to 1.
- After the execution of `temp *= 2`, the new value of `temp` will be `temp * 2`.

Let's consider the two cases for `temp`:

1. If `temp` was initially 2 (which means `temp * 2 < k` was true):
   - After `temp *= 2`, `temp` becomes `2 * 2 = 4`.

2. If `temp` was initially 1 (which means `temp * 2 < k` was false):
   - After `temp *= 2`, `temp` becomes `1 * 2 = 2`.

Since the value of `temp` affects the value of `i` and the condition `temp * 2 < k`, we need to adjust `i` accordingly:
- If `temp` becomes 4, then `i` should be 1 if `4 * 2 < k`, otherwise `i` should be 0.
- If `temp` becomes 2, then `i` should be 1 if `2 * 2 < k`, otherwise `i` should be 0.

However, the problem statement does not require us to recalculate `i` explicitly in the output state, only to reflect the updated value of `temp`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a new list of strings obtained from the input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `i` is 1 if `temp * 2 < k`, otherwise `i` is 0; `temp` is 4 if `temp` was initially 2, otherwise `temp` is 2; `k0` is equal to `k`; The input that controls the loop has decremented by 1; `ans` is an empty list; `temp * 2` is less than `k` if `i` is 1, otherwise `temp * 2` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
