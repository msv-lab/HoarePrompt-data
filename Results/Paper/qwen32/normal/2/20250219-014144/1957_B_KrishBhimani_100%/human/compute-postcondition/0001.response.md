The code reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter, and assigns this list to the variable `l1`. The value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**
