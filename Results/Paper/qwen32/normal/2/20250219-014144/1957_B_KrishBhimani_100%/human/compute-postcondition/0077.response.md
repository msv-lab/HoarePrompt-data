The code snippet `temp *= 2` multiplies the current value of `temp` by 2. Given the initial state, `temp` starts with a value of 1. After executing this line, `temp` will be updated to 2.

No other variables are affected by this operation. The values of `t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `i`, `k0`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a new list of strings obtained from the input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; if `n` equals 1, the program does not alter `t`, `l1`, `n`, or `k`; otherwise, `ans` is a list containing `n` elements, where the first two elements are `[(1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1)]` and the remaining `n-2` elements are `0`; `i` is 0; `temp` is 2; `k0` is equal to `k`; The input that controls the loop has decremented by 1; `ans` is an empty list; `temp * 2` is less than `k`.**
