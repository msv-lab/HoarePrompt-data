Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `temp * 2` was less than `k` initially; `temp` is either `8 * temp` (if initially `temp * 2` was less than `k`) or `2` (if initially `temp * 2` was not less than `k`).**
