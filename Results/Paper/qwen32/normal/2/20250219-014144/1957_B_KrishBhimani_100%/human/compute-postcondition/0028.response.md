To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables `i` and `temp`.

The loop continues as long as `temp * 2 < k`. Each iteration doubles `temp` and increments `i` by 1 until `temp * 2` is no longer less than `k`. At this point, the loop breaks.

Let's analyze the final state:
- `i` will be the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became greater than or equal to `k`.
- `temp` will be the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.

Given the initial state:
- `temp` starts at 1.
- `i` starts at 0.

After each iteration:
- `temp` becomes `2 * temp`.
- `i` becomes `i + 1`.

The loop terminates when `temp * 2 >= k`. Therefore, the final value of `temp` will be `2^i` where `2^(i+1) >= k` but `2^i < k`.

**Output State:** The loop will continue doubling `temp` and incrementing `i` until `temp * 2` is no longer less than `k`. The final state will be:
- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `l1` remains a list of strings.
- `n` remains the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
- `k` remains the integer value of the second element of `l1`.
- `arr` remains an empty list.
- `k0` remains equal to `k`.
- `ans` remains an empty list.
- `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became greater than or equal to `k`.
- `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.

In natural language: The loop will keep doubling the value of `temp` and incrementing `i` until doubling `temp` again would make it greater than or equal to `k`. At that point, `temp` will be the highest power of 2 that is still less than `k`, and `i` will reflect how many times `temp` was doubled. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became greater than or equal to `k`; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.**
