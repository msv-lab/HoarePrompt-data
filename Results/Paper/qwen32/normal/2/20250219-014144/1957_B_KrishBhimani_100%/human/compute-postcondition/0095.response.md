The given code snippet appends zeros to the list `ans` until its length equals `n`. Since `ans` initially contains two elements, the number of zeros appended will be `n - 2`.

Given:
- `ans` initially contains `[(1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1)]`.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`.

After executing the code:
- `ans` will have a length of `n`, with the additional elements being zeros.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a new list of strings obtained from the input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `i` is the maximum value for which `temp * 2 < k` holds true; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`; `k0` is equal to `k`; The input that controls the loop has decremented by 1; `ans` is a list containing the elements `[(1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1)]` followed by `n - 2` zeros.**
