In this case, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute at least once regardless of the values of any variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `i` is 0; `ans` is an empty list; `temp` is 1**
