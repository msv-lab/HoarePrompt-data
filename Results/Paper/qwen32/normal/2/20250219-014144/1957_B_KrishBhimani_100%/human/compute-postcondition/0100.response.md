Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, if `n` is 1, it outputs `k`. Otherwise, it calculates a list starting with the largest power of 2 minus one that is less than `k`, followed by the remainder when `k` is subtracted by this value, and fills the rest of the list with zeros up to length `n`. The function prints the result for each test case.**
