The code appends the value of `k - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Given that `ans` initially contains one element \((1 << i) - 1\), the new element appended will be `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`.

Let's break down the changes:
- `ans` initially contains one element \((1 << i) - 1\).
- The new element being appended is `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`, which simplifies to `k - (1 << i) + 1`.

Thus, after the execution, `ans` will contain two elements: \((1 << i) - 1\) and `k - (1 << i) + 1`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` remains a list of strings; `n` remains the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` remains the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` remains an empty list; `k0` remains equal to `k`; `ans` is now a list containing the elements \((1 << i) - 1\) and `k - (1 << i) + 1`; `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became greater than or equal to `k`; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.**
