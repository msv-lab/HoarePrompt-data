In this case, the `while` loop is defined as `while True:`, which means it will always execute indefinitely unless there is a `break` statement inside the loop body (which is omitted here). Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

Here is the state as it is, since no changes are required:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `temp * 2 < k` is false or true respectively; `temp` is either 1 or `2 * temp` depending on whether `temp * 2 < k` is false or true respectively; `k0` is equal to `k`. If `temp * 2 < k`, then `i` is 1 and `temp` is `2 * temp`. Otherwise, `i` is 0 and `temp` is 1.**
