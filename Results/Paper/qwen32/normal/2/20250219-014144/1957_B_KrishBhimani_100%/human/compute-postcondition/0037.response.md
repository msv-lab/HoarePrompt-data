Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.

### Conditions:
- If `n` equals 1, the program does not alter `t`, `l1`, `n`, or `k`.
- Otherwise, several other variables (`arr`, `k0`, `ans`, `i`, `temp`) are defined, but these do not affect the value of `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(k)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k`. According to the initial state, `k` is the integer value of the second element of the list `l1`.

Since there are no operations modifying `k` unless `n` equals 1 (which doesn't change `k` either), the value of `k` remains as it was initially set from the second element of `l1`.

### Conclusion:
The value of `k` is derived directly from the input list `l1` and is not altered by any subsequent operations in the code snippet provided.

Therefore, the output will be the integer value of the second element of the list `l1`.

Output: **k (where k is the integer value of the second element of the list `l1`)**
