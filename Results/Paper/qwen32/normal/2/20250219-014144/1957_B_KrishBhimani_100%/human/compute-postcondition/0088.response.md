The given code snippet is `temp *= 2`. This operation doubles the value of the variable `temp`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `temp` is 4 if `temp * 2 < k` initially, otherwise `temp` remains 1.
- `i` is 2 if `temp * 2 < k` initially, otherwise `i` remains 0.

After executing `temp *= 2`:
- If `temp` was initially 4, it will now be 8.
- If `temp` was initially 1, it will now be 2.

No other variables are affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a new list of strings obtained from the input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `i` is 2 if `temp * 2 < k` initially, otherwise `i` remains 0; `temp` is 8 if `temp` was initially 4, otherwise `temp` is 2; `k0` is equal to `k`; The input that controls the loop has decremented by 1; `ans` is an empty list; `temp * 2` is less than `k` if `i` is 1, otherwise `temp * 2` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
