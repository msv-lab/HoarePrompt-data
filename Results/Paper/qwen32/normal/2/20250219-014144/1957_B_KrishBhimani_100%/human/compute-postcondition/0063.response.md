The given code snippet appends zeros to the `ans` list until its length matches `n`. 

Given the initial state, `ans` initially contains two elements: `[(1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1)]`. The code appends zeros to `ans` until its length is equal to `n`.

Let's denote the initial length of `ans` as `len(ans)`, which is 2. The number of zeros to be appended is `n - len(ans)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `ans` is a list containing `n` elements, where the first two elements are `[(1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1)]` and the remaining `n-2` elements are `0`; `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became greater than or equal to `k`; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`; `k0` is equal to `k`.**
