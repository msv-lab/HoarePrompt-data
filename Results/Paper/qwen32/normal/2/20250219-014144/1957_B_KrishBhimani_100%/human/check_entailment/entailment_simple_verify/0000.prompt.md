You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

If `n` was 1, it printed `k`. Otherwise, it printed a list starting with the largest power of 2 minus one that is less than `k`, followed by the remainder when `k` is subtracted by this power of 2 minus one, and then filled the rest of the list with zeros up to length `n`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

Let's analyze the provided program and see if it meets the problem requirements for all possible inputs.

### Program Analysis:

The program aims to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers whose sum is `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR.

Here is the provided program again for reference:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        if n == 1:
            print(k)
        else:
            arr = []
            k0 = k
            i = 0
            ans = []
            temp = 1
            while True:
                if temp * 2 < k:
                    temp *= 2
                    i += 1
                else:
                    break
            ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
            ans.append(k - sum(ans))
            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
            print(*ans)
```

### Issues Identified:

1. **Maximizing the Number of 1s in Bitwise OR:**
   - The current approach is to find the highest power of 2 less than `k`, subtract it from `k`, and then append the remainder and zeros to fill the sequence.
   - This strategy does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - Consider the case where `n = 3` and `k = 7`. The optimal solution would be `[3, 3, 1]` because `3 | 3 | 1 = 3` (binary `11`) which has 2 ones, whereas the current program might produce something like `[3, 4, 0]` which results in `3 | 4 | 0 = 7` (binary `111`) having 3 ones, but this is not always the best solution in terms of maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

### Counterexample:

Let's take the following input:

```
1
3 7
```

Expected Output (one of the possible correct outputs):

```
3 3 1
```

Actual Output from the Program:

```
7 0 0
```

Explanation of the Actual Output:

- The program finds the highest power of 2 less than 7, which is 4 (`2^2`).
- It then appends `4 - 1 = 3` and `7 - 3 = 4` to the sequence.
- Finally, it fills the remaining positions with zeros, resulting in `[3, 4, 0]`.

However, `[3, 3, 1]` is a better solution because the bitwise OR of `[3, 3, 1]` is `3` (binary `11`), which has 2 ones, whereas the bitwise OR of `[3, 4, 0]` is `7` (binary `111`), which has 3 ones. But the goal is to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR, and `[3, 3, 1]` achieves this by distributing the sum in a way that maximizes the number of 1s in the OR result.

### Conclusion:

The program does not always produce the sequence that maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
