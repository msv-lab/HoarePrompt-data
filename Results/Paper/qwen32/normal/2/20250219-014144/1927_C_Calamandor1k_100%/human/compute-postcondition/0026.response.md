The code creates a new set `relevant_a` that contains elements from `unique_a` which are less than or equal to `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list containing at least one tuple (n_next, m_next, k_next, a_next, b_next) where n_next and m_next are integers such that 1 ≤ n_next, m_next ≤ 2·10^5, k_next is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k_next ≤ 2·min(n_next, m_next), a_next is a list of n_next integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, b_next is a list of m_next integers where each integer b_j satisfies 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6, `results` is a list containing the string `'YES'`, `unique_a` is a set containing the unique elements of `a_next`, `unique_b` is a set containing the unique elements of `b_next`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` which are less than or equal to `k`.**
