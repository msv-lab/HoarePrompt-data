The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the variables or their values; it simply moves the control back to the beginning of the loop for the next iteration.

Given the initial state, the `continue` statement does not change any of the variables or their values. It merely skips the remaining part of the loop body for the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration.

Therefore, the output state remains exactly the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list containing at least one tuple (n_next, m_next, k_next, a_next, b_next) where n_next and m_next are integers such that 1 ≤ n_next, m_next ≤ 2·10^5, k_next is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k_next ≤ 2·min(n_next, m_next), a_next is a list of n_next integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, b_next is a list of m_next integers where each integer b_j satisfies 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6. `unique_a` is a set containing the unique elements of `a_next`, `unique_b` is a set containing the unique elements of `b_next`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` which are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` which are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements from `relevant_a` which are not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements from `relevant_b` which are not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set containing elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`. If the length of `only_b` is greater than k // 2, `results` is a list containing the string `'YES'` followed by the string `'NO'`. Otherwise, `results` remains as `'YES'`. `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`. `results` now includes `'NO'` as its last element.**
