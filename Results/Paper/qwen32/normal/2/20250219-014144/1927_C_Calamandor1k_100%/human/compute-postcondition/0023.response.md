The only objects in the loop head are the tuple `(n, m, k, a, b)` from the list `cases`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state related to these variables for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `cases` is a list containing at least one tuple (n, m, k, a, b)
- `results` is a list containing the string `'YES'`

Since the loop iterates over `cases`, the next iteration will process the next tuple in the list. Let's denote the current tuple as `(n, m, k, a, b)` and assume it has already been processed. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another tuple in `cases`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next tuple in the list `cases`. We don't have specific information about the next tuple, but we know it exists because the problem states that `cases` contains at least one tuple and we've just processed one.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list containing at least one tuple (n, m, k, a, b) where n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, b is a list of m integers where each integer b_j satisfies 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6, `results` is a list containing the string `'YES'`**.

However, to be more precise for the next iteration, we need to indicate that the first tuple has been processed and the loop is moving to the next tuple. Since we don't have the exact next tuple, we can represent it as `(n_next, m_next, k_next, a_next, b_next)`:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list containing at least one tuple (n_next, m_next, k_next, a_next, b_next) where n_next and m_next are integers such that 1 ≤ n_next, m_next ≤ 2·10^5, k_next is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k_next ≤ 2·min(n_next, m_next), a_next is a list of n_next integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, b_next is a list of m_next integers where each integer b_j satisfies 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6, `results` is a list containing the string `'YES'`**.

This represents the state at the start of the next iteration, assuming there is another tuple to process.
