To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's carefully analyze the logic and ensure it aligns with the problem requirements.

### Problem Recap

We need to determine if it's possible to choose exactly \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from both arrays \(a\) and \(b\) such that every integer from 1 to \(k\) is included among the chosen elements.

### Key Points to Verify

1. **Filtering Elements**: The program filters elements in both arrays to only consider those that are less than or equal to \(k\).
2. **Counting Unique Elements**:
   - `only_a`: Elements unique to array \(a\).
   - `only_b`: Elements unique to array \(b\).
   - `both`: Elements common to both arrays.
3. **Constraints**:
   - The number of elements in `only_a` and `only_b` should not exceed \(\frac{k}{2}\).
   - The total number of distinct elements (`total_distinct`) should be at least \(k\).

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Filtering Elements**:
   - The program correctly creates sets `unique_a` and `unique_b` from arrays \(a\) and \(b\) respectively.
   - It then filters these sets to include only elements that are less than or equal to \(k\), resulting in `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.

2. **Calculating Sets**:
   - `only_a` is calculated as `relevant_a - relevant_b`.
   - `only_b` is calculated as `relevant_b - relevant_a`.
   - `both` is calculated as `relevant_a & relevant_b`.

3. **Checking Constraints**:
   - The program checks if the number of elements in `only_a` or `only_b` exceeds \(\frac{k}{2}\). If so, it appends 'NO' to the results.
   - It calculates the total number of distinct elements that can be chosen from both arrays (`total_distinct`).
   - If `total_distinct` is less than \(k\), it appends 'NO' to the results; otherwise, it appends 'YES'.

### Potential Issues

1. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - **No Common Elements**: If there are no common elements between `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`, the program still checks if the total number of unique elements is at least \(k\).
   - **All Elements in One Array**: If all elements from 1 to \(k\) are present in only one array, the program correctly checks if the number of elements in that array is at least \(k\).

2. **Efficiency**:
   - The use of sets ensures that the operations are efficient, even for large input sizes.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **First Example**:
   - \(a = [2, 3, 8, 5, 6, 5]\)
   - \(b = [1, 3, 4, 10, 5]\)
   - \(k = 6\)
   - `relevant_a = {2, 3, 5, 6}`
   - `relevant_b = {1, 3, 4, 5}`
   - `only_a = {2, 6}`
   - `only_b = {1, 4}`
   - `both = {3, 5}`
   - `total_distinct = 5` (which is >= \(k\))
   - Output: 'YES'

2. **Second Example**:
   - \(a = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5]\)
   - \(b = [1, 3, 8, 10, 3]\)
   - \(k = 6\)
   - `relevant_a = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`
   - `relevant_b = {1, 3}`
   - `only_a = {2, 4, 5, 6}`
   - `only_b = {1}`
   - `both = {3}`
   - `total_distinct = 6` (which is >= \(k\)), but `only_a` has 4 elements which is > \(\frac{k}{2}\)
   - Output: 'NO'

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to choose exactly \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from both arrays such that every integer from 1 to \(k\) is included among the chosen elements. The program handles various edge cases and constraints appropriately.
