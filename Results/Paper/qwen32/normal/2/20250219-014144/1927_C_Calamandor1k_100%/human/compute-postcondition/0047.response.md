The code calculates the difference between two sets, `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`, and assigns the result to `only_a`. This means `only_a` will contain elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `only_a`. All other variables (`t`, `cases`, `unique_a`, `unique_b`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list containing at least one tuple `(n_next, m_next, k_next, a_next, b_next)`, and the next tuple `(n, m, k, a, b)` is the next item in `cases` to be processed; `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from the list `a`; `unique_b` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`; `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`; `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`; `only_a` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`.**
