The code snippet provided is simply `continue`, which means it will skip the rest of the current iteration in a loop and move to the next iteration. Given this, none of the variables will be modified in this particular step.

Therefore, the Output State remains exactly the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list containing at least one tuple `(n_next, m_next, k_next, a_next, b_next)`, and the next tuple `(n, m, k, a, b)` is the next item in `cases` to be processed; `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from the list `a`; `unique_b` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`; `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`; `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`; `only_a` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`; `only_b` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`; `both` is a set containing elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`; `results` contains an additional element `'NO'`. `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`.**
