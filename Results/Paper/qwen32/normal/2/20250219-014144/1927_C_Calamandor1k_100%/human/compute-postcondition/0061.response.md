Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list containing `t` tuples (n, m, k, a, b) where n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, b is a list of m integers where each integer b_j satisfies 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6. `results` is a list containing `t` strings, each either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, determined by the conditions specified in the loop.**

### Explanation in Natural Language:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive, representing the total number of test cases. The list `cases` contains exactly `t` tuples, each representing a distinct test case with specific parameters (n, m, k, a, b). The list `results` will contain exactly `t` strings, each indicating whether the corresponding test case met the specified conditions (`'YES'`) or did not (`'NO'`). Each string in `results` is determined by evaluating the sets derived from the lists `a` and `b` based on the value of `k` for that test case.
