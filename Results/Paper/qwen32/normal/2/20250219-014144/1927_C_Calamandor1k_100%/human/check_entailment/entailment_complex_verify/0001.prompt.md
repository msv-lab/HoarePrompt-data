You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an array a of n integers, an array b of m integers, and an even number k
.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly \frac{k}{2}
elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every
integer from 1 to k is included.

For example:

  * If a=[2, 3, 8, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 4, 10, 5] , k=6 , then it is possible to choose elements with values 2, 3, 6 from array a and elements with values 1, 4, 5 from array b . In this case, all numbers from 1 to k=6 will be included among the chosen elements.
  * If a=[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 8, 10, 3] , k=6 , then it is not possible to choose elements in the required way. 

Note that you are not required to find a way to choose the elements — your
program should only check whether it is possible to choose the elements in the
required way.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n, m \le 2\cdot10^5 , 2 \le k \le 2 \cdot \min(n, m) , k is even) — the length
of array a , the length of array b , and the number of elements to be chosen,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_j \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n and m over all test cases in a test
does not exceed 4 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to choose \frac{k}{2} numbers from
each array in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1
to k is included. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 2 , 3 , and 6 from array a and elements equal to 1 , 4 , and 5 from array b
. Thus, all numbers from 1 to k=6 are included among the chosen elements.

In the second test case of the example, it can be shown that it is not
possible to choose exactly three elements from each array in the required way.

In the third test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 1 and 3 from array a and elements equal to 2 and 4 from array b . Thus, all
numbers from 1 to k=4 are included among the chosen elements.

    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` containing `t` strings, each either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, determined by the conditions specified in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list `cases` containing `t` tuples. Each tuple includes integers `n` and `m` indicating the lengths of two lists, an even integer `k`, and two lists `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. For each test case, the function evaluates whether certain conditions related to the elements of lists `a` and `b` and the value of `k` are met. It returns a list of `t` strings, each either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, based on these evaluations.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Recap:
We need to determine if it's possible to choose exactly `k/2` elements from two arrays `a` and `b` such that all integers from 1 to `k` are included among the chosen elements.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads `t`, the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It creates sets `unique_a` and `unique_b` from arrays `a` and `b` respectively to get unique elements.
   - It then creates `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` which contain elements from `unique_a` and `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`.
   - It calculates:
     - `only_a`: Elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`.
     - `only_b`: Elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`.
     - `both`: Elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.
   
3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - If the number of elements in `only_a` is greater than `k//2`, it appends 'NO' to the results because we cannot choose more than `k/2` elements from `a`.
   - Similarly, if the number of elements in `only_b` is greater than `k//2`, it appends 'NO' to the results.
   - If the total distinct elements (from `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`) are less than `k`, it appends 'NO' to the results because we cannot cover all integers from 1 to `k`.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it appends 'YES' to the results.

### Verification:
- The logic checks whether the combination of elements from both arrays can cover all integers from 1 to `k` while respecting the constraint of choosing exactly `k/2` elements from each array.
- The use of sets ensures that we efficiently handle unique elements and perform set operations to determine the feasibility of the selection.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as per the given requirements and constraints.

**Correctness:** **True**
