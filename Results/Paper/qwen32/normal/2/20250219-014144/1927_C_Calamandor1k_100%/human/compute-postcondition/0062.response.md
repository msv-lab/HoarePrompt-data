Output State: **The program returns a list `results` containing `t` strings, each either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, determined by the conditions specified in the loop.**

This means that after processing each tuple in the `cases` list according to the specified conditions, the program will output a list of `t` strings, where each string is either `'YES'` or `'NO'`.
