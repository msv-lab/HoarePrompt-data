Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three parts: (1) a tuple `(n, m, k)` where `n` and `m` are integers representing the lengths of two lists, and `k` is an even integer; (2) a list `a` of `n` integers; and (3) a list `b` of `m` integers. The function processes each test case and returns a list `results` containing `t` strings, each either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, based on unspecified conditions within the function.**
