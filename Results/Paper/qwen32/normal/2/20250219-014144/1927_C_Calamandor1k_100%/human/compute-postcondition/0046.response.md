The code snippet creates a new set `relevant_b` that contains elements from `unique_b` which are less than or equal to `k`. This operation does not affect the existing sets `unique_a` and `relevant_a`, nor does it alter the variables `t`, `cases`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, or `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list containing at least one tuple `(n_next, m_next, k_next, a_next, b_next)`, and the next tuple `(n, m, k, a, b)` is the next item in `cases` to be processed; `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from the list `a`; `unique_b` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`; `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`; `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`.**
