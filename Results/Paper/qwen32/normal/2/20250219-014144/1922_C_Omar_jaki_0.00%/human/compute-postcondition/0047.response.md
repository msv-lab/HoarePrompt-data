To determine the output state, let's break down the given code snippet:

```python
b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
```

Here, `b` is initially `[0, 0]`. The operation `b += ...` means that the tuple `(b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y))` will be appended to `b`.

Let's analyze each part of the tuple separately:

1. `b[-2]`: This refers to the second-to-last element of `b`, which is `0` since `b` is `[0, 0]`.
2. `v ** (v > x - w)`: Here, `v > x - w` is a boolean expression. In Python, `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0`. So, `v ** (v > x - w)` will be `v ** 1` if `v > x - w` is `True`, or `v ** 0` if `v > x - w` is `False`. Since any number to the power of `0` is `1`, this expression simplifies to `v` if `v > x - w` is `True`, or `1` if `v > x - w` is `False`.
3. `b[-1]`: This refers to the last element of `b`, which is `0` since `b` is `[0, 0]`.
4. `v ** (v > z - y)`: Similar to the previous expression, this will be `v` if `v > z - y` is `True`, or `1` if `v > z - y` is `False`.

Given these points, the new elements being added to `b` are:
- `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)`: `0 + v` if `v > x - w` is `True`, or `0 + 1` if `v > x - w` is `False`.
- `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`: `0 + v` if `v > z - y` is `True`, or `0 + 1` if `v > z - y` is `False`.

Therefore, the updated `b` will be:
- If both `v > x - w` and `v > z - y` are `True`, `b` becomes `[0, 0, v, v]`.
- If `v > x - w` is `True` and `v > z - y` is `False`, `b` becomes `[0, 0, v, 1]`.
- If `v > x - w` is `False` and `v > z - y` is `True`, `b` becomes `[0, 0, 1, v]`.
- If both `v > x - w` and `v > z - y` are `False`, `b` becomes `[0, 0, 1, 1]`.

Since the exact values of `v`, `x`, `w`, `z`, and `y` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of the new elements in `b`. However, we can describe the possible states.

Output State: **`u` is potentially a different value; the list remains potentially modified; `t` is potentially a different value; `a` is a tuple with at least 4 elements, starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by at least two elements returned by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`; `b` is `[0, 0, v if v > x - w else 1, v if v > z - y else 1]`; `v` is `y - x`.**
