Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` and a sorted list `a` of `n` distinct integers. Additionally, it receives `m` queries, each consisting of two distinct integers `x_i` and `y_i`. The function processes these queries and returns the absolute difference between the elements at positions `x_i` and `y_i` in the list `a` for each query.**
