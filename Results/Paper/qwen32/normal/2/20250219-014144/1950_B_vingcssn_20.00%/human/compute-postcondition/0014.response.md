The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'##..##'`. This string is hardcoded and does not depend on any of the variables (`t`, `casos`, `n`) mentioned in the initial state.

Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 20.
- `casos` is an integer between 1 and 20.
- `n` is an integer that is neither 1 nor 2, and in this specific instance, it is 3.

However, none of these variables are used within the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will simply be the string `'##..##'`.

Output: **##..##**
