Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, `casos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ casos ≤ 20, `n` is an input integer, and `c` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, ensuring `c < casos`.**

Natural Language: The value of `n` is updated to the new input integer. The values of `t`, `casos`, and `c` remain unchanged except that `c` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
