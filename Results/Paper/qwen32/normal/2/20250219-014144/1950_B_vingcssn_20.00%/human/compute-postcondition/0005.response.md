Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- `casos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ casos ≤ 20.
- `n` is an input integer, and the current value of `n` is 1.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('##')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('##')
```
This statement explicitly prints the string `'##'`.

### Explanation:
- The values of `t`, `casos`, and `n` are provided but are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, they do not influence the output.
- The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'##'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **##**
