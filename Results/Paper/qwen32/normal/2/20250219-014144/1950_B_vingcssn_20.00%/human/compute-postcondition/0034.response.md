Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, `casos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ casos ≤ 20, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 2, then the current value of `n` remains 2. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to 1 and `n` is not equal to 2, which means `n` can be any integer other than 1 or 2.**
