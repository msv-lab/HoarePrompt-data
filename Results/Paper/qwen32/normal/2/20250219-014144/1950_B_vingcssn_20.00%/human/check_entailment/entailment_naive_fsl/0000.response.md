Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program only handles specific cases for `n` (1, 2, 3, and 4). It explicitly checks for these values and prints the corresponding checkerboard patterns. However, the problem description specifies that `n` can be any integer from 1 to 20. Therefore, the program will not work correctly for any value of `n` outside of these specific cases (i.e., for `n` equal to 5 through 20). For example, if `n` is 5, the program will print "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the appropriate 10x10 checkerboard pattern. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for all possible inputs within the specified range.
