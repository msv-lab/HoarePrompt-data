Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\).
- `casos` is an integer such that \(1 \leq casos \leq 20\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `c` is incremented by 1 (`c = c + 1`), ensuring `c < casos`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('##')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('##')` statement simply prints the string `'##'`. There are no variables or conditions affecting the content of the string being printed. The values of `t`, `casos`, `n`, and `c` do not influence the output of this specific print statement because they are not referenced within it.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string `'##'`.

Output: **##**
