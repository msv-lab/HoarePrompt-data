Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\).
- `casos` is an integer such that \(1 \leq casos \leq 20\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `c` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, ensuring `c < casos`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('##..##')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement `print('##..##')` directly outputs the string `'##..##'`. None of the variables (`t`, `casos`, `n`, `c`) are used within this print statement. Therefore, their values do not influence the output.

### Conclusion:
The output of the print statement is simply the string `'##..##'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **##..##**
