You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . Output a 2n \times 2n checkerboard made of 2
\times 2 squares alternating '\texttt{#} ' and '\texttt{.} ', with the top-
left cell being '\texttt{#} '.

The picture above shows the answers for n=1,2,3,4 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 20 ) — the number of test
cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 20
) — it means you need to output a checkerboard of side length 2n .

Output

For each test case, output 2n lines, each containing 2n characters without
spaces — the checkerboard, as described in the statement. Do not output empty
lines between test cases.

        if n == 1:

            print('##')
        elif n == 2:
            print('##..')

            print('##..##')
            print('..##..')
            print('..##..')
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
        elif n == 4:
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
        else:
            print('No esta en el rango')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 20. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20 and prints a specific pattern of hashes (`#`) and dots (`.`) based on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 4, it prints "No esta en el rango".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to handle multiple test cases where each test case requires generating a specific size of a checkerboard pattern. The pattern consists of 2x2 squares alternating between '#' and '.', starting with '#' in the top-left corner.

Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` from the input.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
3. It then checks the value of `n` and prints the corresponding checkerboard pattern based on the hardcoded values for `n = 1`, `n = 2`, `n = 3`, and `n = 4`.

However, there are several issues with this approach:
- The program only handles specific values of `n` (1, 2, 3, and 4). If `n` is outside this range, it prints "No esta en el rango" (which translates to "Not in range"), which is not the expected behavior according to the problem description.
- The program does not generate the checkerboard pattern dynamically for any arbitrary `n` within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20).

To be considered correct, the program should be able to generate the checkerboard pattern for any `n` within the given range dynamically, rather than relying on hardcoded patterns for specific values of `n`.

Given these points, the program is not correct as it fails to meet the requirements for all possible values of `n` within the specified range.

Correctness: **False**
