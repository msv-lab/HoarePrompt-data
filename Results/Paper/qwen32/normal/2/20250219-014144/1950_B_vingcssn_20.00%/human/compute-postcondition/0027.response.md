The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print('##..##..')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'##..##..'` without referencing any variables or conditions. Therefore, the output is simply the string as it is written.

The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `casos`, and `n`, but these do not affect the execution of this specific `print` statement since it does not use them.

Thus, the output is:

Output: **##..##..**
