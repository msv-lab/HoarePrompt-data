Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to handle multiple test cases where each test case requires generating a specific size of a checkerboard pattern. The pattern consists of 2x2 squares alternating between '#' and '.', starting with '#' in the top-left corner.

Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` from the input.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
3. It then checks the value of `n` and prints the corresponding checkerboard pattern based on the hardcoded values for `n = 1`, `n = 2`, `n = 3`, and `n = 4`.

However, there are several issues with this approach:
- The program only handles specific values of `n` (1, 2, 3, and 4). If `n` is outside this range, it prints "No esta en el rango" (which translates to "Not in range"), which is not the expected behavior according to the problem description.
- The program does not generate the checkerboard pattern dynamically for any arbitrary `n` within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20).

To be considered correct, the program should be able to generate the checkerboard pattern for any `n` within the given range dynamically, rather than relying on hardcoded patterns for specific values of `n`.

Given these points, the program is not correct as it fails to meet the requirements for all possible values of `n` within the specified range.

Correctness: **False**
