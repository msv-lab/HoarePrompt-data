### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to handle multiple test cases, each requiring the generation of a 2n x 2n checkerboard pattern with alternating 2x2 blocks of '#' and '.' characters. The top-left block should always be '#'.

The program correctly handles the cases for n = 1, 2, 3, and 4 by explicitly printing the required patterns. However, it does not provide a solution for values of n greater than 4. Instead, it prints "No esta en el rango" (which translates to "Not in the range"), which is not in line with the problem's requirements. The problem specifies that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, so the program should generate the correct pattern for all values within this range.

Since the program fails to meet the requirements for n > 4, it cannot be considered correct for all possible valid inputs.

### Correctness: **False**
