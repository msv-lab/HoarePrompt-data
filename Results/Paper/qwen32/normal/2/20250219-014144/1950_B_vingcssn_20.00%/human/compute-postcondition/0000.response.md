The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `casos`. Given the initial state, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, which means `casos` will also be an integer within this range after the input is taken.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, `casos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ casos ≤ 20.**
