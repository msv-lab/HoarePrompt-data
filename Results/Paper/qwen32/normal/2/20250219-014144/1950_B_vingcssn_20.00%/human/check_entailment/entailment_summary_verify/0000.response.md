### Reasoning:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program only handles specific cases for `n` (1, 2, 3, and 4). For these values, it correctly prints the corresponding checkerboard patterns. However, for any value of `n` greater than 4, the program outputs "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the appropriate checkerboard pattern. This means the program does not meet the requirements for all possible inputs within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20).

To be considered correct, the program should generate the checkerboard pattern for any value of `n` within the given range. Since the program fails to do this for `n` values greater than 4, it cannot be considered correct according to the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
