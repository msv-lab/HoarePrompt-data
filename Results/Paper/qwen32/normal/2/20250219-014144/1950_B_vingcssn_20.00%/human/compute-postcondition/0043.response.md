The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is:

```python
print('..##')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'..##'` without any reference to the variables `t`, `casos`, `n`, or `c`. Therefore, the output does not depend on the values of these variables.

Based on the initial state provided, none of the variables (`t`, `casos`, `n`, `c`) influence the output of this specific `print` statement. The string `'..##'` is hardcoded and will be printed as is.

Output: **..##**
