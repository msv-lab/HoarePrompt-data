Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `s` is a non-empty string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in the non-empty string `s`, `i` is the next key in `hmp`. If `hmp[i] < m`, `ans` is incremented by `m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
