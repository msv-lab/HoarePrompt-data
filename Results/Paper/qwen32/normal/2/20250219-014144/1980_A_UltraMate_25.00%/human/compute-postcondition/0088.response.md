To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the components of the expression used to calculate `ans`.

### Given Information:
- `t` is 1 (though it's not used in the calculation of `ans`).
- `n` is the first integer from the new input.
- `m` is the second integer from the new input.
- `s` is the string from the new input.
- `p` is the string 'ABCDEF'.
- `hmp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each character in the string `s`.
- `ans` is calculated as `3 * m + sum(max(0, m - hmp[i]) for i in hmp)`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Calculate `hmp`**:
   - `hmp` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`.
   - For example, if `s = "AABBC"`, then `hmp` would be `{'A': 2, 'B': 2, 'C': 1}`.

2. **Calculate `ans`**:
   - `ans` consists of two parts:
     1. `3 * m`: This is simply three times the value of `m`.
     2. `sum(max(0, m - hmp[i]) for i in hmp)`: This part sums up the maximum of 0 and the difference between `m` and the count of each character in `hmp`.

### Example Calculation:

Let's assume `m = 3` and `s = "AABBC"` for concreteness.

- `hmp` would be `{'A': 2, 'B': 2, 'C': 1}`.
- `3 * m` is `3 * 3 = 9`.
- The sum part is calculated as follows:
  - For 'A': `max(0, 3 - 2) = max(0, 1) = 1`
  - For 'B': `max(0, 3 - 2) = max(0, 1) = 1`
  - For 'C': `max(0, 3 - 1) = max(0, 2) = 2`
  - Summing these values gives `1 + 1 + 2 = 4`.
- Therefore, `ans = 9 + 4 = 13`.

### General Description:

Given the initial state, `ans` is calculated based on the value of `m` and the frequency of characters in the string `s`. The formula ensures that for each character in `s`, if its count is less than `m`, the difference is added to `ans`; otherwise, 0 is added.

### Final Output:

Since the exact values of `m` and `s` are not provided, we describe `ans` in terms of `m` and `hmp`.

Output: **ans (where ans is calculated as 3 * m + sum(max(0, m - hmp[i]) for i in hmp))**
