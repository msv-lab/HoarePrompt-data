To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the formula for `ans`.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is `t - 1`: This suggests that `t` was initially some value, but it's decremented by 1. However, `t` is not used in the calculation of `ans`, so we can ignore this for now.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.
- `s` is the string from the input.
- `p` is the string `'ABCDEF'`.
- `hmp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each character in `s`.
- `ans` is calculated as `4 * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)`.

### Calculation of `ans`:
1. **First Term**: `4 * m`
   - This term is straightforward; it's simply four times the value of `m`.

2. **Second Term**: `sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)`
   - This term involves iterating over each character `i` in the `hmp` counter.
   - For each character `i` in `hmp`, if the frequency of `i` (`hmp[i]`) is less than `m`, then `m - hmp[i]` is added to the sum.
   - Essentially, this term calculates how many more occurrences of each character are needed to reach `m` for characters that currently have fewer than `m` occurrences.

### Putting It Together:
Given the above breakdown, `ans` is the sum of `4 * m` and the total number of additional occurrences required for characters in `s` to each have at least `m` occurrences.

### Output Description:
Since the specific values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe it precisely based on the given information.

Output: **ans (where ans is 4 * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m), with m being the second integer from the input and hmp being the frequency counter of the string s from the input)**
