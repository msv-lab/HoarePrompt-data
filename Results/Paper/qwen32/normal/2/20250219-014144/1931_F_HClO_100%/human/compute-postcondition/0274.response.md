Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's analyze the situation step-by-step:

1. **Variables and Lists Initialization:**
   - `a1`: The first integer from the input.
   - `l1`: A list of the remaining integers from the input.
   - `a2`: Set to 12.
   - `l2`: Set to `[13, 14, 15]`.
   - `l11`: A list of elements from `l1` excluding any 12s.
   - `l22`: `[13, 14, 15]` excluding `a1` if `a1` is in `[13, 14, 15]`.
   - `val`: Set to `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (8, [9, 10, 11])]`.

2. **Other Variables:**
   - `_`: Calculated as `x + (m - 2)` where `x` is the initial value of `_` and `x + (m - 2) < t`.
   - `t`: Such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`.
   - `n` and `m`: Values read from the input.
   - `idx1`: Not `-1`.
   - `idx1 <= idx2`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('no')`.

The print statement `print('no')` directly outputs the string `'no'` regardless of the values of the other variables and lists defined in the initial state. This is because the string `'no'` is explicitly provided in the print statement.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **no**
