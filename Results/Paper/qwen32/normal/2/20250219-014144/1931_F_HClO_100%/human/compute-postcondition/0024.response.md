The given code initializes two variables `p1` and `p2` to 0. No other variables are modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; if `m` is 1, it remains 1; `a1` is the first integer from the next input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be at least 3; `idx1` is -1; `idx2` is -1; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0.**
