Output State: **`_` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration and `x + 1 < t`; `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`; `n` and `m` are the values read from the input; `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged; `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged; `idx1` is not `-1`; `idx1 <= idx2`; `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (8, [9, 10, 11])]`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, all the variables retain their previous values and conditions.
