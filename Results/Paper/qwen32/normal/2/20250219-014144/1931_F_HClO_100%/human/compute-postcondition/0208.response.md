Postcondition: **`_` is `n - 1` if `l11` equals `l22`, otherwise `_` is `n + m - 2`. `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`. `n` and `m` remain unchanged. `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged. `l1` and `l2` remain unchanged. `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged. If `idx2` is `-1` and `idx1` is not `-1`, then `idx2` is updated to `n - 2`. `idx1` is not `-1` if `idx2` was initially `-1`. `p1` and `p2` are either `0` or `1` depending on whether `a2` or `a1` was encountered in `l1` or `l2` respectively. `val` is an empty list.**
