The code snippet assigns the value of `l2` to `l`. This means that `l` now holds the same list as `l2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `l2` has `a2` inserted at position `idx1`, and considering all other conditions and values remain as specified, the output state is:

Output State: **`m` is 2; `_` is `n - 1` if `l11` equals `l22`, otherwise `_` is `n + m - 2`; `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`; `n` and `m` remain unchanged; `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged; `l1` remains unchanged; `l2` has `a2` inserted at position `idx1`; `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged; `idx1` is not `-1` if `idx2` was initially `-1`; `p1` and `p2` are either `0` or `1` depending on whether `a2` or `a1` was encountered in `l1` or `l2` respectively; `val` is an empty list; `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`; `a3` is 4; `l3` is [5, 6, 7]; the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`; `l` is `l2` which has `a2` inserted at position `idx1`.**
