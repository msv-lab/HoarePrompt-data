The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 5.

Since `n` is at least 5, `n - 1` is at least 4, and thus the loop can still execute with `i` being 5.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 5, `m` is an integer read from the input (and must be at least 3 if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`), `a1` is the first integer from the next input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`. `i` is 5.**
