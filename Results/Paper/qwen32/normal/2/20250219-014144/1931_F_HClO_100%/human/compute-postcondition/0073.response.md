Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 5, `m` is an integer read from the input (and must be at least 3 if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`), `a1` is the first integer from the next input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, and `i` is 5. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, no additional changes are made. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` is set to 5, `idx2` is set to 5, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
