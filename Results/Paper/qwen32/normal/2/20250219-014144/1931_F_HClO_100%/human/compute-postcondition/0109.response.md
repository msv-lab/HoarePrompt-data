To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for _ in range(m - 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state. The controlling variable here is `m`. Since the loop runs for `m - 2` iterations, we need to adjust `m` accordingly.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `m` is at least 3
- `n` is an integer read from the input
- `a1` is the first integer from the next input line
- `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` if `idx1 >= idx2`, otherwise `l1` remains unchanged
- `a2` is the first integer from the new input line
- `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` if `idx1 < idx2`
- `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2` (before the insertion of `a1`)
- `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`
- `l11` is not equal to `l22`
- `idx1` is either -1 or `n - 2`
- `idx2` is not -1
- `p1` is 0
- `p2` is 0
- The loop has completed all `n - 1` iterations without setting `idx1` to a non-negative value (except possibly in the last iteration)
- `val` contains an additional element `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from the new input line and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line
- If `idx1 > idx2`, `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` and `m` is decremented by 1. If `idx1 < idx2`, `l` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`
- `a3` is the first integer from the new input line
- `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line

Since the loop runs for `m - 2` iterations, at the start of the next iteration, `m` should be decremented by 1 because one iteration has just completed. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is at least 2, `n` is an integer read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the next input line, `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` if `idx1 >= idx2`, otherwise `l1` remains unchanged, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` if `idx1 < idx2`, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2` (before the insertion of `a1`), `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `idx1` is either -1 or `n - 2`, `idx2` is not -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, the loop has completed all `n - 1` iterations without setting `idx1` to a non-negative value (except possibly in the last iteration), `val` contains an additional element `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from the new input line and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, if `idx1 > idx2`, `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`. If `idx1 < idx2`, `l` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, `a3` is the first integer from the new input line, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line**
