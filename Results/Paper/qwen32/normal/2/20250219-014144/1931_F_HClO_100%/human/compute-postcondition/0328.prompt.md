Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is 12, `l2` is [13, 14, 15], `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any 12s, `l22` is [13, 14, 15] excluding `a1` if `a1` is in [13, 14, 15], `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (8, [9, 10, 11])]`, `_` is `x + (m - 2)` where `x` is the initial value of `_` and `x + (m - 2) < t` if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `_` remains unchanged, `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`, `n` and `m` are the values read from the input, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `idx1 <= idx2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is 12, `l2` is [13, 14, 15], `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any 12s, `l22` is [13, 14, 15] excluding `a1` if `a1` is in [13, 14, 15], `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (8, [9, 10, 11])]`, `_` is `x + (m - 2)` where `x` is the initial value of `_` and `x + (m - 2) < t` if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `_` remains unchanged, `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is the values read from the input. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, then `idx1` is set to `i` if `l1[i + p1] == a2` else `-1`, `idx2` is `-1` if `l1[i + p1] == a2` else `i`, `p1` is `1` if `l1[i + p1] == a2` else `0`, and `p2` is `0` if `l1[i + p1] == a2` else `1`. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to `i`, `p1` is 0, and `p2` is 0. Otherwise, `idx1` and `idx2` remain unchanged if `l1[i + p1] == l2[i + p2]`. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are greater than or equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is 12, `l2` is [13, 14, 15], `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any 12s, `l22` is [13, 14, 15] excluding `a1` if `a1` is in [13, 14, 15], `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (8, [9, 10, 11])]`, `_` is `x + (m - 2)` where `x` is the initial value of `_` and `x + (m - 2) < t` if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `_` remains unchanged, `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is the value read from the input, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to `i`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, then `idx1` is set to `i` and `p1` is incremented by 1. If `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx2` is set to `i` and `p2` is incremented by 1. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` or both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is 12, `l2` is [13, 14, 15], `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any 12s, `l22` is [13, 14, 15] excluding `a1` if `a1` is in [13, 14, 15], `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (8, [9, 10, 11])]`, `_` is `x + (m - 2)` where `x` is the initial value of `_` and `x + (m - 2) < t` if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `_` remains unchanged, `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is the value read from the input, `i` is `k + 2`, `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged unless `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l1[i + p1] != a2`, `idx1` is `k + 2` if `l1[i + p1] == a2` else `idx1` remains unchanged, `idx2` is `k + 2` if `l1[i + p1] != a2` else `idx2` remains unchanged. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, `p1` and `p2` may change, and `idx1` or `idx2` may be updated accordingly.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
