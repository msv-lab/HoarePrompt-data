Postcondition: **`a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is 12, `l2` is [13, 14, 15], `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any 12s, `l22` is [13, 14, 15] excluding `a1` if `a1` is in [13, 14, 15], `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (8, [9, 10, 11])]`, `_` is `x + (m - 2)` where `x` is the initial value of `_` and `x + (m - 2) < t` if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `_` remains unchanged, `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is the values read from the input. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, then `idx1` is set to `i` if `l1[i + p1] == a2` else `-1`, `idx2` is `-1` if `l1[i + p1] == a2` else `i`, `p1` is `1` if `l1[i + p1] == a2` else `0`, and `p2` is `0` if `l1[i + p1] == a2` else `1`. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to `i`, `p1` is 0, and `p2` is 0. Otherwise, `idx1` and `idx2` remain unchanged if `l1[i + p1] == l2[i + p2]`. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are greater than or equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
