The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Since there is no loop structure provided in the context, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the flow in this isolated snippet.

Therefore, none of the variables are altered, and the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is 12, `l2` is [13, 14, 15], `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any 12s, `l22` is [13, 14, 15] excluding `a1` if `a1` is in [13, 14, 15], `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (8, [9, 10, 11])]`, `_` is `x + (m - 2)` where `x` is the initial value of `_` and `x + (m - 2) < t`, `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`, `n` and `m` are the values read from the input, `idx1` is not `-1`, `idx1 <= idx2`.**
