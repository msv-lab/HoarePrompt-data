To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variable `_` in the `for` loop head and the condition that allows the loop to continue executing.

Given:
- The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`.
- `_` at the end of the previous iteration was some value that is less than `t`.
- `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
- The value of `_` depends on whether `l11` equals `l22`:
  - If `l11` equals `l22`, `_` is `n - 1`.
  - Otherwise, `_` is `n + m - 2`.

Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this increment.

Let's denote the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration as `x`. Therefore, `x < t`. At the start of the next iteration, `_` will be `x + 1`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `_` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration.
- Since `x < t`, it follows that `x + 1 <= t` for the loop to continue executing.

Given that the exact value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we can represent the state in terms of the relationship between `_` and `t`.

State: **`_` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration and `x + 1 < t`; `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`; `n` and `m` remain unchanged; `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged; `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged; `idx1` is not `-1`; `idx1 <= idx2`; `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (8, [9, 10, 11])]`**.

However, to simplify and provide a concrete example, let's assume `_` was `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration (since it could be either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`). Then at the start of the next iteration, `_` would be `n`.

State: **`_` is `n`; `t` is such that `n` is less than `t`; `n` and `m` remain unchanged; `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged; `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged; `idx1` is not `-1`; `idx1 <= idx2`; `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (8, [9, 10, 11])]`**.

If `_` was `n + m - 2` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `_` would be `n + m - 1`.

State: **`_` is `n + m - 1`; `t` is such that `n + m - 1` is less than `t`; `n` and `m` remain unchanged; `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged; `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged; `idx1` is not `-1`; `idx1 <= idx2`; `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (8, [9, 10, 11])]`**.

Without knowing the exact value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize:

State: **`_` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration and `x + 1 < t`; `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`; `n` and `m` remain unchanged; `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged; `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged; `idx1` is not `-1`; `idx1 <= idx2`; `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (8, [9, 10, 11])]`**.
