The code snippet assigns the value of `l2` to `l`. This means `l` now holds the same list as `l2`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `a3` is the first integer from the new input line; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l2` has `a2` inserted at index `idx1`; the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`; `l` is equal to `l2`.**
