The given code snippet inserts the value of `a2` into the list `l2` at the position specified by `idx1`. 

Given that `a2` is 12 and `idx1` is `n - 2` if `idx1 == -1 and idx2 != -1`, otherwise `idx1` remains -1, we need to consider the possible scenarios for `idx1`.

However, the problem statement does not specify the exact value of `idx1` before the insertion operation. For the sake of providing a concrete output state, let's assume `idx1` is indeed `n - 2` (as it would be if `idx1` was initially -1 and `idx2` was not -1).

Thus, the value 12 (`a2`) will be inserted into `l2` at the position `n - 2`.

Let's update `l2` accordingly:

- If `idx1` is `n - 2`, and assuming `n` is such that `n - 2` is a valid index in `l2` (which currently has 3 elements), the insertion will occur at that position.

For example, if `n` is 3, `idx1` would be 1, and `l2` would become `[13, 12, 14, 15]`.

If `n` is 4, `idx1` would be 2, and `l2` would become `[13, 14, 12, 15]`.

If `n` is 5, `idx1` would be 3, and `l2` would become `[13, 14, 15, 12]`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can generalize the output state based on the assumption that `idx1` is `n - 2` and `n` is such that `n - 2` is a valid index in `l2`.

Output State: **`a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is 12, `l2` is `[13, ..., 12, ..., 14, 15]` with `12` inserted at index `n - 2`, `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any 12s, `l22` is `[13, 14, 15]` excluding `a1` if `a1` is in `[13, 14, 15]`, `val` is [], `_` is `x + (m - 2)` where `x` is the initial value of `_` and `x + (m - 2) < t` if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `_` remains unchanged, `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`, `n` is the value read from the input, `m` is the value read from the input, `i` is `n - 1`, `p1` and `p2` are determined by the comparisons made during the iterations, `idx1` is `n - 2` if `idx1 == -1 and idx2 != -1`, otherwise `idx1` remains -1, and `idx2` is `n - 2` if `idx2 == -1 and idx1 != -1`. Additionally, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`. If `m` is 2, then `_` is updated to `x + (m - 2)` if `l11` is not equal to `l22`. `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, and the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`.**
