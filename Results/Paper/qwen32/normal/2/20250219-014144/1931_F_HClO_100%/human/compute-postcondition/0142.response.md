The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is used as an iteration counter in the `range(m - 2)`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `_` by 1.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is `n - 1`.
- The loop runs for `m - 2` iterations.

To proceed with the next iteration, `_` should be incremented by 1.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `_` is less than `m - 2`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `_` was `n - 1`.
- For the next iteration, `_` should be `n`.

Since none of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`) are part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`_` is `n`, `t` is such that `n` is less than `t`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` must be greater than 2, `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input line, `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any elements that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding any elements that are equal to `a1`**
