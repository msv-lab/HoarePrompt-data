The code snippet `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into integers, assigns the first integer to `a3`, and the remaining integers to `l3`.

Given the initial state, the only variables that will be affected are `a3` and `l3`. The values of `a3` and `l3` will be determined by the input provided.

Let's assume the input is `4 5 6 7` (as per the example given in the initial state).

- `a3` will be assigned the value `4`.
- `l3` will be assigned the list `[5, 6, 7]`.

All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l`, `val`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is `n - 1` if `l11` equals `l22`, otherwise `_` is `n + m - 2`; `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`; `n` and `m` remain unchanged except `m` must be greater than 2; `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged; `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged; `idx1` is not `-1`; If `idx1 < idx2`, then `l2` has `a2` inserted at position `idx1` and `idx1` is less than `idx2 + 1`; If `idx1 > idx2`, then `idx2` is `n - 2` and `l1` has `a1` inserted at index `n - 2`; If `idx1 <= idx2`, then `m` is 1, `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7])]`, `a3` is 4, `l3` is `[5, 6, 7]`. If the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, `l1` is modified by inserting `a1` at position `idx2` and `l2` remains unchanged, resulting in `l` being `l1` with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`. Otherwise, `l1` remains unchanged, `l2` has `a2` inserted at position `idx1`, and `l` is `l2` with `a2` inserted at position `idx1`. `m` must be greater than 2; `a3` is 4; `l3` is `[5, 6, 7]`.**
