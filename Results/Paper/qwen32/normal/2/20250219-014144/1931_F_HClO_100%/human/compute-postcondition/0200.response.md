Postcondition: **`_` is `n - 1` if `l11` equals `l22`, otherwise `_` is `n + m - 2`; `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1; `m` is the second integer from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the latest input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input line; `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any elements that are equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding any elements that are equal to `a1`; `i` is incremented by 1. If `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to `i` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is also broken out of. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, the control continues without modifying `idx1` and `idx2`.**
