Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` is `n - 1`
- `t` is such that `n < t`
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `m` is the second integer from the input

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the string `'yes'`. The values of the variables `_`, `t`, `n`, and `m` do not affect the output of this particular `print` statement because it does not reference any of these variables. It directly outputs the string `'yes'`.

### Output:
Output: **yes**
