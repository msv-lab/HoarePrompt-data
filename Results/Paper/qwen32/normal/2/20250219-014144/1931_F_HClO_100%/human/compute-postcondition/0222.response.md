Postcondition: **`m` is 2; `_` is `n - 1` if `l11` equals `l22`, otherwise `_` is `n + m - 2`; `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`; `n` and `m` remain unchanged; `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged; `l1` and `l2` remain unchanged; `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged; `idx1` is not `-1` if `idx2` was initially `-1`; `p1` and `p2` are either `0` or `1` depending on whether `a2` or `a1` was encountered in `l1` or `l2` respectively; `val` is an empty list; `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`; `a3` is 4; `l3` is [5, 6, 7]; the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`.**
