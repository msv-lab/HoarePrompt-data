The code snippet `l = l1` assigns the value of `l1` to `l`. This means that `l` now holds the same list as `l1`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `a3` is the first integer from the new input line; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l1` has `a1` inserted at the position `idx2`; the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`; `l` is the same as `l1`.**
