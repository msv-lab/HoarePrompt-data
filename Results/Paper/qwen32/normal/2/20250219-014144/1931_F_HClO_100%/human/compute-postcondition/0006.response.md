Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; the current value of `m` is 1.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not affect the values of the variables. It is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the provided context, the `continue` statement has no effect on the variables `t`, `n`, or `m`. Therefore, the values remain unchanged.
