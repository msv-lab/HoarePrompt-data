Output State: **`_` is `n - 1` if `l11` equals `l22`, otherwise `_` is `n + m - 2`; `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`; `n` and `m` remain unchanged; `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged; `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged; `idx1` is not `-1`; `idx1 <= idx2`; `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7])]`; `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables. It only causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement. All other conditions and variable values remain as specified in the initial state.
