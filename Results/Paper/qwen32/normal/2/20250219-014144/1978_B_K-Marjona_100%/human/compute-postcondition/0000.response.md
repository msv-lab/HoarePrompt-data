In the given task, the for loop iterates based on the number of test cases, which is read from the input. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable that doesn't affect the loop's execution directly; it simply iterates a specified number of times.

Here's the loop statement again for reference:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the value that `int(input())` will return. This value determines how many times the loop will iterate. Since the problem states that `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, we need to ensure that the input function returns a value within this range.

Given that the loop head only involves the input function and the loop variable `_`, we can only adjust the input to ensure the loop executes. Therefore, the state should reflect that the input must be an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and `input()` returns `t`**
