Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `a` is the second integer read from the input, `b` is the third integer read from the input, and `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. If `b <= a`, the value of `k` remains the same as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. Otherwise, the value of `k` remains the same as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.** 

Since the postconditions for both the if and else parts are identical, the overall postcondition does not change the state of the variables beyond what is already described in the precondition and the definition of `k`.
