Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `a` is the second integer read from the input, `b` is the third integer read from the input. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `k` is 0. Otherwise, `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.**
