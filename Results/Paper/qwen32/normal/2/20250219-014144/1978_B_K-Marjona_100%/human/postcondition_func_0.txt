The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it computes and prints a value based on the relationship between `a` and `b`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `a * n`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints a more complex expression involving `n`, `a`, and `b` to determine the result.
