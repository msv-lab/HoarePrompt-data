The given code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The initial state includes the variable `t` which is an integer between 1 and 10^4, and `k` which is defined based on the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.

After executing the code snippet, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will be updated to the integers read from the input. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the value of `k` is still defined based on the minimum of `n` and `b - a`, but since `n`, `a`, and `b` have been reassigned, `k` would need to be recalculated using these new values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are the integers read from the input, `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.**
