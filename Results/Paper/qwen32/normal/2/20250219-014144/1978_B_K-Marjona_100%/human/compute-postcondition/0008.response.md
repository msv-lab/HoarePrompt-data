In this case, the loop is defined as:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head contains only the underscore `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The underscore `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted. The loop will continue to execute as long as the value of `int(input())` is greater than 0.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, the only thing we need to consider is how many times the loop can still execute. This is determined by the number of times `int(input())` can be called and return a positive integer.

Since the loop head does not involve `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, or `k`, these variables do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. The loop's continuation depends solely on the number of remaining iterations, which is controlled by the input.

Therefore, the state remains the same in terms of the variables mentioned, but conceptually, the number of iterations left decreases by one each time the loop runs.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `a` is the second integer read from the input, `b` is the third integer read from the input. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `k` is 0. Otherwise, `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.**
