### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in the code aligns with the problem statement and correctly computes the maximum profit Bob can obtain from selling the buns under the given conditions.

1. **Understanding the Promotion Logic:**
   - Bob can sell up to `k` buns at a modified price, where the price of the `i-th` bun is `(b - i + 1)` coins.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each.
   - The goal is to maximize the total revenue.

2. **Choosing `k`:**
   - The value of `k` should be chosen such that the total revenue is maximized.
   - The maximum possible value of `k` is `min(n, b - a + 1)`. This is because if `b - a + 1` is less than `n`, selling more than `b - a + 1` buns at the modified price would not increase the revenue since the price would drop below `a`.
   - However, the code uses `min(n, b - a)`, which is slightly off. It should be `min(n, b - a + 1)` to correctly handle the scenario where `b - a + 1` is the maximum number of buns that can be sold at a higher price.

3. **Calculating Revenue:**
   - If `b <= a`, then selling all buns at the usual price `a` is optimal, and the total revenue is `a * n`.
   - If `b > a`, the total revenue is calculated as:
     - Revenue from the first `k` buns: `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2` (sum of an arithmetic series).
     - Revenue from the remaining `(n - k)` buns: `(n - k) * a`.
     - Total revenue: `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.

4. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code correctly handles the case where `b <= a` by printing `a * n`.
   - For `b > a`, the code calculates the revenue using the formula mentioned above.
   - However, the choice of `k` as `min(n, b - a)` instead of `min(n, b - a + 1)` could lead to incorrect results in scenarios where `b - a + 1` is the optimal number of buns to sell at the modified price.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program is almost correct but contains a minor flaw in the calculation of `k`. The correct value of `k` should be `min(n, b - a + 1)` instead of `min(n, b - a)`. Therefore, the current implementation may not always yield the correct maximum profit.

**Correctness: False**

However, if the intention was to simplify the logic and the problem constraints ensure that `b - a` is sufficient to cover the optimal `k`, then the program might still work correctly in practice. But strictly speaking, based on the problem description, the correct `k` should be `min(n, b - a + 1)`.

Thus, the final answer considering strict adherence to the problem description is:

**Correctness: False**
