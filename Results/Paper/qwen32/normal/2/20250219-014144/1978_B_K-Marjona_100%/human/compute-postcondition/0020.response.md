To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each set of inputs and what the final state will look like once all iterations are completed.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each iteration, it reads three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- It calculates `k` as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.
- If `b <= a`, it prints `a * n`.
- Otherwise, it prints `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.

### Final Output State:
After all iterations, the loop will have processed all `t` test cases, and the output will be the concatenation of the results from each test case.

### Variables Affected:
- `t`: This variable determines the number of iterations and remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- `n`, `a`, `b`: These variables change with each iteration as they are read from the input.
- `k`: This variable is recalculated in each iteration based on the current values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

### Unchanged Variables:
- The initial value of `t` remains unchanged.
- The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` do not persist between iterations; they are overwritten in each iteration.

### Output State:
The final output state consists of the results printed for each of the `t` test cases. Each result is determined by the logic inside the loop based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for that particular test case.

### Conclusion:
The output state after all iterations is a series of printed results, one for each test case, based on the provided logic. Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not specified beyond the initial conditions, we can only describe the final state in terms of the process rather than specific values.

Output State: **The output consists of `t` lines, each representing the result of the computation for each test case based on the given logic.**
