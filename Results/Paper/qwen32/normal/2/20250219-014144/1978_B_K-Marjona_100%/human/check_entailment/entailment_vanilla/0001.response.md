Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

Bob wants to maximize his profit from selling `n` buns. He can choose an integer `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b)) such that:
- The first `k` buns are sold at decreasing prices starting from `b` down to `b - k + 1`.
- The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

The goal is to find the value of `k` that maximizes the total revenue.

### Program Explanation

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Choosing `k`:**
   - The program calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. This is because:
     - If `b - a` is greater than `n`, then we can't sell more than `n` buns at the modified price.
     - If `b - a` is less than `n`, then we can only sell up to `b - a` buns at the modified price because the price cannot go below 1.

3. **Calculating Profit:**
   - If `b <= a`, it means selling at the modified price doesn't give any advantage, so all buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
   - Otherwise, the profit is calculated as:
     - `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`: This part calculates the sum of the arithmetic series from `b` to `b - k + 1`.
     - `(n - k) * a`: This part calculates the revenue from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`.

### Correctness Verification

Let's verify the logic with the example test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
   - Calculation: `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = 1`
   - Profit: `5 * 1 - 1 * (1 - 1) // 2 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 12 = 17`

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Calculation: `k = min(5, 9 - 5) = 5`
   - Profit: `9 * 5 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 45 - 10 = 35`

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
   - Calculation: `k = min(10, 5 - 10) = 0`
   - Profit: `10 * 10 = 100`

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - Calculation: `k = min(5, 11 - 5) = 5`
   - Profit: `11 * 5 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 55 - 10 = 45`

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `n = 10^9`, `a = 10^9`, `b = 10^9`
   - Calculation: `k = min(10^9, 10^9 - 10^9) = 0`
   - Profit: `10^9 * 10^9 = 10^18`

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input: `n = 10^9`, `a = 10^9`, `b = 1`
   - Calculation: `k = min(10^9, 1 - 10^9) = 0`
   - Profit: `10^9 * 10^9 = 10^18`

7. **Test Case 7:**
   - Input: `n = 1000`, `a = 1`, `b = 1000`
   - Calculation: `k = min(1000, 1000 - 1) = 999`
   - Profit: `1000 * 999 - 999 * (999 - 1) // 2 + (1000 - 999) * 1 = 999000 - 498501 + 1 = 499499 + 1 = 50050
