You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (n, x) representing Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling, respectively, with the constraints 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9. The length of q is between 1 and 100, inclusive.

The length of q is between 1 and 100, inclusive. If w is an integer such that w is equal to its integer division by 1 and w is greater than or equal to x - 1, then M is a list containing the single element w. Otherwise, M remains an empty list.

    return M
    #The program returns `M`, which contains all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` along with their corresponding quotients if those quotients are also greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `q` where each tuple contains two integers `(n, x)` representing Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling, respectively, with the constraints \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\). It also accepts an integer `x`. The function returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `n` from each tuple in `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, along with their corresponding quotients if those quotients are also greater than or equal to `x - 1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the number of possible values of `k` such that, given Vasya's position `n` in the line and the number `x` he received during the settling, the conditions of the problem are satisfied.

The settling pattern is periodic with a period of `2k - 2`. Within one period, the sequence starts from 1 and increases to `k`, then decreases back to 2. We need to determine how many different `k` values can produce the number `x` at position `n`.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`.
   - If `y` is odd, the code immediately prints `0` because the pattern described in the problem cannot produce an odd sum of `n` and `x`.

3. **Finding Possible `k` Values:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with parameters `(y - 2) // 2` and `x`. This function finds divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, the function `func_1` is called again with parameters `(n - x) // 2` and `x`. This accounts for another part of the pattern where the sequence might start over.
   - The results from both calls to `func_1` are combined into a list `L1`, duplicates are removed using `set`, and the length of the resulting list is printed.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It checks both `i` and `q // i` to ensure all divisors are considered.

### Evaluation:
- The logic seems to correctly identify potential `k` values by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequence and checking divisors.
- The initial check for `y % 2 != 0` is correct because the sum `n + x` must be even for the sequence to fit the described pattern.
- The use of `set` to remove duplicates ensures that each `k` value is counted only once.

### Conclusion:
The provided code appears to correctly implement the solution based on the problem description and handles edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
