The code snippet `M += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `M`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the list `M` will now contain the element `1`.

The initial state specifies several conditions about the list `q` and the variable `i`, which remain unchanged by this operation. Specifically, `q` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `(n, x)` with the constraints `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9` and `x` must be at least 2. The length of `q` is between 1 and 100, inclusive, and the length of `q` modulo `i` equals 0. Additionally, `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

Since only `M` is modified, the output state is:

Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `(n, x)` representing Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling, respectively, with the constraints 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and x must be at least 2. The length of `q` is between 1 and 100, inclusive. The length of `q` modulo `i` equals 0. Additionally, `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. `M` is a list containing the single element `[1]`.**
