Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Understanding:
The problem involves determining how many values of `k` fit the given constraints where:
- `n` is Vasya's position in the line.
- `x` is the number Vasya received during the settling process.
- The settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.

### Key Points:
1. **Settling Pattern**: 
   - The first `k` positions are numbered `1, 2, ..., k`.
   - The next `k - 2` positions are numbered `k - 1, k - 2, ..., 2`.
   - This pattern repeats.

2. **Constraints**:
   - `1 <= x < n <= 10^9`
   - `k > 1`

3. **Objective**:
   - Find all possible values of `k` such that the number at position `n` is `x`.

### Code Analysis:

#### Main Loop:
- The main loop reads `t` test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`.
- It calculates `y = n + x` and checks if `y` is odd. If it is, it prints `0` because an odd `y` cannot satisfy the conditions for any `k`.
- If `y` is even, it calls `func_1` with `(y - 2) // 2` and `x` to find potential `k` values.
- If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it calls `func_1` again with `(n - x) // 2` and `x` and adds the results.
- It removes duplicates from the list of potential `k` values and prints the count.

#### Function `func_1(q, x)`:
- This function finds divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
- It includes both the divisor and its complement if they meet the condition.
- It also checks if the square root of `q` is an integer and meets the condition.

### Verification:
- The logic seems to be based on finding divisors of certain expressions derived from `n` and `x` that could represent valid `k` values.
- However, there are some concerns:
  - The function `func_1` is not defined within the scope of the provided code snippet.
  - The condition `n >= 3 * x - 2` might not be correctly capturing all valid `k` values.
  - The approach of using `y = n + x` and checking divisors might not fully cover all possible `k` values.

### Conclusion:
Given the incomplete definition of `func_1` and the potential issues with the logic for determining valid `k` values, the code cannot be considered correct without further verification and completion.

**Correctness: False**
