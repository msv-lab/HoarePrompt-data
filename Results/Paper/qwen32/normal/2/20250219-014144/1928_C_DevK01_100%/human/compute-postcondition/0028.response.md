Postcondition: **`q` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `(n, x)`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `w` is at least `i + 1`. If `q % i == 0`, and `i >= x - 1`, `M` includes the value of `i`. Additionally, if `q[0][0] // i >= x - 1`, `M` now includes an additional element which is `q[0][0] // i`. If `q % i != 0`, no changes are made to `M`.**
