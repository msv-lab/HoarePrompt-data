Postcondition: **`q` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (n, x) representing Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling, respectively, with the constraints 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and x must be at least 2. The length of `q` is between 1 and 100, inclusive. `i` is 1. The length of `q` modulo `i` equals 0. Additionally, `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**
