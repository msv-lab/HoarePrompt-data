The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `q` where each tuple contains two integers `(n, x)` representing Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling, respectively, with the constraints \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\). It also accepts an integer `x`. The function returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `n` from each tuple in `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, along with their corresponding quotients if those quotients are also greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
