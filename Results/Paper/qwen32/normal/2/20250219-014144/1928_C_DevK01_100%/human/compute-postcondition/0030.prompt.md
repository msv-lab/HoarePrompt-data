Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: q is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (n, x) representing Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling, respectively, with the constraints 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9. The length of q is between 1 and 100, inclusive. If w is an integer such that w is equal to its integer division by 1 and w is greater than or equal to x - 1, then M is a list containing the single element w. Otherwise, M remains an empty list. i is 1.
Code of the loop:
while i < w:
    if q % i == 0:
        if i >= x - 1:
            M += [i]
        if q // i >= x - 1:
            M += [q // i]
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `q` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `(n, x)` representing Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling, respectively, with the constraints 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and x must be at least 2. The length of `q` is between 1 and 100, inclusive. If the length of `q` modulo `i` equals 0 and `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` is a list containing the single element `[1]`. Otherwise, `M` is not defined. `i` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `q` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `(n, x)`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `w` must be at least `i + 1`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` includes the new element `i`. Additionally, if `q[0][1] // i >= x - 1`, `M` now includes the new element `q[0][1] // i`. If `q % i != 0`, no changes are made to `M`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `q` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `(n, x)`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `w` is at least `i + 1`. If `q % i == 0`, and `i >= x - 1`, `M` includes the value of `i`. Additionally, if `q[0][0] // i >= x - 1`, `M` now includes an additional element which is `q[0][0] // i`. If `q % i != 0`, no changes are made to `M`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
