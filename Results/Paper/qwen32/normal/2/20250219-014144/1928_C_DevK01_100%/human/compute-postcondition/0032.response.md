Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `q`, which is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (n, x) representing Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling, respectively, with the constraints 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9. The function also accepts a parameter `x`, which is an integer. The function returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `n` from each tuple in `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, along with their corresponding quotients if those quotients are also greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**
