To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given conditions:

- We have a `while` loop condition `while i < w`.
- The variable `i` is initialized to 1.
- The variable `w` is determined based on the condition: if `w` is an integer such that `w` is equal to its integer division by 1 and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` is a list containing the single element `w`. Otherwise, `M` remains an empty list.

Given these conditions, we need to ensure that `i < w` holds true for the loop to execute at least once. Since `i` is initialized to 1, `w` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Let's break down the possible values for `w`:
- `w` must be an integer.
- `w` must satisfy `w >= x - 1`.

Since `x` is part of the tuples in the list `q` and `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`, the smallest possible value for `x` is 1. Therefore, the smallest possible value for `w` is `1 - 1 = 0`. However, since `w` must be greater than `i` (which is 1), `w` must be at least 2.

Thus, to ensure the loop executes at least once, `w` must be at least 2. This means `x - 1` must be less than 2, so `x` must be less than 3. Given the constraints, the smallest valid `x` is 1, and the next possible value is 2. To ensure the loop executes, `x` should be 1 or 2, making `w` at least 2.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state so that `w` is at least 2. Since `w` is derived from `x`, we need to ensure that `x` is at least 2 to make `w` at least 2.

State: **`q` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (n, x) representing Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling, respectively, with the constraints 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and x must be at least 2. The length of q is between 1 and 100, inclusive. i is 1.**
