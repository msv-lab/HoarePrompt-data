The code appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is the new input integer; `arr` is the new string input provided by the user; `results` is a list that now contains an additional 'no', making its length one more than before; `i` is incremented by 1.**
