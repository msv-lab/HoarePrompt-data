Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is at least 1, `results` is a list of length `t` containing `'yes'` or `'no'`, and all elements in `results` have been printed.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the state will be that `start` and `end` remain as they were initially (non-negative integers with `start` less than or equal to `end`), `t` will still be at least 1, and `results` will be a list of length `t` containing either `'yes'` or `'no'`. Additionally, every element in the `results` list will have been printed out by the loop.
