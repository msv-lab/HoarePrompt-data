The code snippet assigns the value of `input()` to the variable `arr`. This means `arr` now holds the string input provided by the user. The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `results`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that start <= end; `t` must be greater than 0; `results` is an empty list; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is the string input provided by the user.**
