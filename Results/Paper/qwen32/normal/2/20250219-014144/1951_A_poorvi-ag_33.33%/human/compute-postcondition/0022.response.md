The code appends the string `'no'` to the `results` list. The other variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is the new string input provided by the user; `results` is a list containing the string 'no'; `i` is incremented by 1.**
