Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is the string input provided by the user and contains exactly two occurrences of the character '1', with these two '1's being consecutive ('11' is a substring of `arr'); `results` is a list containing the strings 'no' and 'no'.**

Explanation: The code appends the string 'no' to the list `results`. Initially, `results` contained one element, 'no'. After the execution, `results` now contains two elements, both of which are 'no'. All other variables remain unchanged.
