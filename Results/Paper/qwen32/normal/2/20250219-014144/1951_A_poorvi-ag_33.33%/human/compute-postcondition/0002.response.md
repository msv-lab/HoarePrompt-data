In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range defined by the variable `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variables `start`, `end`, and `results` are mentioned in the initial state but are not part of the loop's head, so they cannot be directly adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

- The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0.
- The variables `start` and `end` do not affect the execution of the loop, but they are part of the initial state, so they should remain as specified.
- The variable `results` being an empty list does not impact the loop's execution, so it remains unchanged.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to set `t` to be greater than 0. The other variables (`start`, `end`, and `results`) remain as they are.

State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that start <= end; `t` must be greater than 0; `results` is an empty list**
