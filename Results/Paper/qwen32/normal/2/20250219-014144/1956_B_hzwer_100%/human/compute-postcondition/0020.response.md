To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation involved:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is set to the integer value of `t`.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers.
- `ans` is computed as the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for each `x` in `cnt`.

### Computation:
The variable `ans` is derived from the `cnt` list. Specifically, it is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for each element `x` in `cnt`. This means that for each element in `cnt`, if the element is greater than 1, we subtract 1 from it; otherwise, we take 0. We then sum up all these results.

### Output:
Given the above computations, the output of `print(ans)` will be the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for each element `x` in the `cnt` list.

Since the exact values of `cnt` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output this computed sum.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of max(0, x - 1) for each x in cnt)**
