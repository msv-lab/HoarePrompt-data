### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Understanding:
- There are `2n` cards with integers ranging from `1` to `n`, and each integer appears exactly twice.
- Cards are distributed between two players: you and Nene, each receiving `n` cards.
- Players take turns placing their cards on the table. If a card with the same integer is already on the table, the player earns a point.
- Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.
- We need to determine the maximum number of points you can earn assuming optimal play from both sides.

#### Key Observations:
- Since Nene plays optimally, she will try to maximize her score and minimize yours.
- If you have a pair of cards with the same integer, you can only earn a point once after Nene has placed the first card.
- If you have a unique card (only one occurrence), you cannot earn a point for it.
- To maximize your points, you should aim to place pairs of cards after Nene has placed the first card of the pair.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of each integer in your hand and calculating the potential points based on these counts.

```python
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = [0] * (n + 1)
        for x in a:
            cnt[x] += 1
        ans = 0
        for x in cnt:
            ans += max(0, x - 1)
        print(ans)

func()
```

- **Counting Occurrences:** The code uses a list `cnt` to count how many times each integer appears in your hand.
- **Calculating Points:** For each integer `x` in your hand, if it appears `cnt[x]` times, you can earn `max(0, cnt[x] - 1)` points. This is because for each pair of the same integer, you can earn one point after the first card of the pair is placed on the table.

#### Correctness Verification:
- The logic of counting occurrences and calculating points based on pairs is correct.
- The code efficiently handles the constraints (up to `2 * 10^5` total cards across all test cases).
- The approach ensures that you are maximizing your points by considering the pairs you have in your hand.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
