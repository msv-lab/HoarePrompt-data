### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to ensure its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
- **Deck Composition**: 2n cards with integers from 1 to n, each integer appearing exactly twice.
- **Game Rules**: Players take turns placing cards on the table. A player scores a point if they place a card that matches a card already on the table.
- **Objective**: Maximize your score, given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

#### Key Points:
1. **Card Distribution**: Each player gets `n` cards, and each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice in the deck.
2. **Scoring**: You can only score points from pairs of cards you hold. If you have two cards of the same integer, you can place the second card after the first one is on the table to score a point.
3. **Optimal Play**: Nene's strategy does not affect your ability to score points from your own pairs since she plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

#### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can score by counting the pairs of cards you hold:
- **Count Array Initialization**: `cnt = [0] * (n + 1)` initializes an array to count occurrences of each integer.
- **Counting Occurrences**: `for x in a: cnt[x] += 1` populates the count array with the frequency of each integer in your hand.
- **Calculating Score**: `ans = 0` initializes the score. `for x in cnt: ans += max(0, x - 1)` adds the number of pairs for each integer to the score. If you have `x` cards of a certain integer, you can form `x - 1` pairs, hence `max(0, x - 1)` ensures that you only add positive pairs.

#### Annotations:
The annotations confirm the state of the program at various points:
- Before the function call: The input is correctly parsed into the number of test cases and the details of each test case.
- Inside the loop: The count array is correctly populated, and the score is calculated based on the pairs of cards you hold.

#### Conclusion:
The solution correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can achieve by counting the pairs of cards you hold. Since Nene's optimal play does not affect your ability to score from your pairs, the solution is indeed correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
