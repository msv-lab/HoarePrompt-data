The code increments the value at index `x` in the list `cnt` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged except for `cnt`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer value of `t`, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must contain at least one element, `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers where the value at index `x` has been incremented by 1, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for each `x` in `cnt`, `x` is the next element in the list `a`. The value at index `x` in `cnt` is now `cnt[x] + 1`.**
