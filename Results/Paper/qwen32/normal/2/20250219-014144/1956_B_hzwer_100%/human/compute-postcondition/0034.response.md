The code snippet `ans += max(0, x - 1)` updates the value of `ans` by adding the maximum of `0` and `x - 1`. Since the initial value of `ans` is `0`, the new value of `ans` will be `max(0, x - 1)`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer value of `t`, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers, `ans` is `max(0, x - 1)`**.
