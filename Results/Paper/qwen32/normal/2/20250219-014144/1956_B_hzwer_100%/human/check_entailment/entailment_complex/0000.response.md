### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to verify its correctness.

#### Problem Breakdown:
- We have `2n` cards, with each integer from `1` to `n` appearing exactly twice.
- Cards are distributed equally between two players.
- Players take turns placing cards on a table.
- A player earns a point if they place a card that already has a matching card on the table.
- Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.
- We need to determine the maximum score you can achieve if you play optimally.

#### Key Observations:
- Since Nene plays optimally, she will always try to maximize her score and minimize yours.
- To maximize your score, you should aim to place cards that will match cards already on the table.
- The optimal strategy involves counting how many cards you have that appear more than once in your hand, because those are the ones that can potentially earn you points.

#### Solution Analysis:
- The provided code reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and the list `a` of `n` integers.
- It initializes a count array `cnt` to keep track of the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
- It then iterates over the count array and sums up `max(0, x - 1)` for each element `x`, which effectively counts the number of pairs of cards you have.
- Finally, it prints this sum as the answer for each test case.

#### Verification:
- The logic of counting pairs (`max(0, x - 1)`) is correct because each pair of cards can contribute to one point if played optimally.
- The provided code correctly implements this logic and handles multiple test cases efficiently.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can achieve under the given conditions.

**Correctness: True**
