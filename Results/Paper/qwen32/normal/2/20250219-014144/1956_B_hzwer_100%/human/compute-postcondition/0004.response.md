The code initializes a list `cnt` with `n + 1` zeros. Given that `n` is the integer value of `t`, and `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the list `cnt` will have a length of `t + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.

The other variables (`t` and `a`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value of `t`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` zeros.**
