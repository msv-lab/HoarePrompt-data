The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used for iteration and does not affect the loop's continuation condition, the only variable we need to adjust is `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue executing. Since the loop decrements `t` by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be at least 2.

Therefore, we need to adjust `t` to be `t - 1` from its current value, ensuring it remains greater than 1.

State: **`path` is `data[4]`; `data` is a list of strings `['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']`; `t` must be greater than 1 (specifically, `t` should be adjusted to `t - 1`); `index` is 5; `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1('a_3')` and the return value of `func_1(data[4])`; `n` is the integer value of `a_2` (which is assumed to be 2 if `data[1]` is `'2'`).**
