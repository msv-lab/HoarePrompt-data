In this task, the loop iterates over the elements in the `results` list. The loop head only involves the variable `result`, which takes each element from the `results` list one by one.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `data` is a list of strings `['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']` where `a_1` is a valid integer such that `2*t` is a valid index in `data`, `t` is the integer value of `a_1`.
- `path` is `data[2*t]`.
- `index` is `1 + 2*t`.
- `results` is a list containing at least one element which is the return value of `func_1(path)`.

Since the loop iterates over `results`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the `result` variable itself, which should take the next value from the `results` list if it exists.

However, since the problem specifies that we only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, and the loop head only contains `result`, we don't need to adjust `data`, `path`, `index`, or `results` directly. We just need to ensure that there is another element in `results` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`data` is a list of strings `['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']` where `a_1` is a valid integer such that `2*t` is a valid index in `data`, `t` is the integer value of `a_1`, `path` is `data[2*t]`, `index` is `1 + 2*t`, `results` is a list containing at least two elements, `result` is the second element of `results`**
