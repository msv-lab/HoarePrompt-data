To determine the output of the `print(result)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **data**: This is a list of strings `['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']` where `a_1` is a valid integer. Let's denote this integer value as `t`.

2. **t**: This is the integer value of the first element in the `data` list, i.e., `t = int(data[0])`.

3. **path**: This is the element in the `data` list at the index `2*t`, i.e., `path = data[2*t]`.

4. **index**: This is calculated as `1 + 2*t`.

5. **results**: This is a list containing at least three elements.

6. **result**: This is the third element of the `results` list, i.e., `result = results[2]`.

Given the `print(result)` statement, we need to identify the value of `result`. According to the initial state, `result` is explicitly defined as the third element of the `results` list.

Since the exact contents of the `results` list are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the third element of the `results` list.

Therefore, the output of the `print(result)` statement will be the third element of the `results` list.

Output: **result (where result is the third element of the results list)**
