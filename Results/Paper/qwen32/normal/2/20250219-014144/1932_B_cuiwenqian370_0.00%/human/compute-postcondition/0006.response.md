The code snippet assigns the value of the integer conversion of `data[index]` to the variable `n`. Given the initial state, `index` is 1, so `data[index]` refers to the second element in the list `data`, which is `'a_2'`. Therefore, `n` will be assigned the integer value of `'a_2'`.

Output State: **`path` is a string representing space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n; `data` is a list of strings ['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']; `t` must be greater than 0; `index` is 1; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `a_2`.**
