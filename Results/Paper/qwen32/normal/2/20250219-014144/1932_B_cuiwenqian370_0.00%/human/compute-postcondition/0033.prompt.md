Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `path` is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*', representing different conditions in a sequence, and the length of `path` (n) is a non-negative integer greater than 0; `n` is the length of `path`. `dp` is a list where the first element is 1 if the first element of `path` is '@', otherwise it is `-inf`. If `n` is greater than 1, the second element of `dp` is `-inf` if the second element of `path` is '*', otherwise, it is 2 if the first element of `path` is '@', otherwise it is `-inf`. All other elements of `dp` are 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(2, n):
    if path[i] == '*':
        dp[i] = -float('inf')
    else:
        dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `path` is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*', the length of `path` (n) is at least 3. `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 1 if `path[0]` is '@', otherwise it is `-inf`, `dp[1]` is `-inf` if `path[1]` is '*', otherwise, it is 2 if `path[0]` is '@', otherwise it is `-inf`. If `path[i]` is '*', then `dp[2]` is `-inf`. Otherwise, `dp[2]` is 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `path` is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*', the length of `path` (n) is at least 3. `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 1 if `path[0]` is '@', otherwise it is `-inf`, `dp[1]` is `-inf` if `path[1]` is '*', otherwise, it is 2 if `path[0]` is '@', otherwise it is `-inf`. If `path[2]` is '*', then `dp[2]` is `-inf`. Otherwise, `dp[2]` is 3. If `path[3]` is '*', then `dp[3]` is `-inf`. Otherwise, `dp[3]` is `max(dp[2], dp[1]) + (1 if path[3] == '@' else 0)`. `i` is 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `path` is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*', the length of `path` (n) is at least 4. `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 1 if `path[0]` is '@', otherwise it is `-inf`, `dp[1]` is `-inf` if `path[1]` is '*', otherwise, it is 2 if `path[0]` is '@', otherwise it is `-inf`. If `path[2]` is '*', then `dp[2]` is `-inf`. Otherwise, `dp[2]` is 3. If `path[3]` is '*', then `dp[3]` is `-inf`. Otherwise, `dp[3]` is `max(dp[2], dp[1]) + (1 if path[3] == '@' else 0)`. If `path[4]` is '*', then `dp[4]` is `-inf`. Otherwise, `dp[4]` is `max(dp[3], dp[2]) + (1 if path[4] == '@' else 0)`. `i` is 4.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
