The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. No other variables are modified. Therefore, the values of `path`, `data`, `t`, and `index` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`path` is a string representing space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n; `data` is a list of strings ['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']; `t` is the integer value of `a_1`; `index` is 1; `results` is an empty list.**
