### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on the periodicity of each sign.
- Each subsequent sign must occur strictly after the previous one.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The code consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function processes a string of characters ('@' and '*').
   - It uses dynamic programming to compute a score based on the sequence of these characters.
   - The function returns the maximum value from the `dp` list that is greater than negative infinity.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Reads input from standard input.
   - Parses the input into test cases.
   - Calls `func_1` for each test case with a string (`path`) derived from the input.
   - Prints the results returned by `func_1`.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations describe the state of the program at various points but do not relate to the problem of determining the year of the n-th sign's occurrence.
- The annotations indicate that `func_1` processes a sequence of '@' and '*' characters, which is not relevant to the problem.

#### Evaluation:
- The problem requires calculating the year of the n-th sign's occurrence based on periodicity and sequential order.
- The provided code does not address this requirement. Instead, it processes sequences of '@' and '*' characters, which is unrelated to the problem.
- The annotations confirm that `func_1` is processing a sequence of characters and not the periodicity of signs.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
