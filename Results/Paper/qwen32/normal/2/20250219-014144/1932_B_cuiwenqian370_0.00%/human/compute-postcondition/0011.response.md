The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state of other variables in the loop. However, the loop's continuation depends on the variable `t`. Since `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `t` is decremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `path` is `'a_3'`
- `data` is a list of strings `['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']`
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `index` is 3
- `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1('a_3')`
- `n` is the integer value of `a_2`

Since `t` must be decremented by 1 for the loop to execute again, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`path` is `'a_3'`; `data` is a list of strings `['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']`; `t` must be greater than 1; `index` is 3; `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1('a_3')`; `n` is the integer value of `a_2`**
