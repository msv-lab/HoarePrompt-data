Reasoning:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem described. Let's break down why:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function seems to be designed to process a sequence of characters ('@' and '*') and calculate some kind of score based on that sequence.
   - However, the problem requires us to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs based on their periodicities.
   - The function `func_1` is completely unrelated to the problem at hand. It does not handle the periodicity of events or sequential occurrences of signs.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads input and processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` with a string of space-separated integers, which represent the periodicities of the signs.
   - Since `func_1` does not correctly solve the problem, calling it here will not yield the correct results.
   - The function `func_2` is also incorrectly implemented for the given problem because it treats the periodicities as a string rather than a list of integers and passes it to `func_1`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need a function that calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs based on their periodicities. Here's a brief outline of how such a function could look:

- Initialize the current year to 0.
- For each sign, find the next occurrence of that sign after the current year.
- Update the current year to the year of the next occurrence.
- Continue this process until all signs have occurred.
- Return the year of the last sign's occurrence.

Given the above reasoning, the provided code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
