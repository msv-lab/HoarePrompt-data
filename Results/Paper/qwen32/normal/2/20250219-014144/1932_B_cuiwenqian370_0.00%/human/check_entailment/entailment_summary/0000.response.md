Reasoning:  
The provided code does not match the problem description at all. The problem requires determining the year in which the nth sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicity of each sign. The provided functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, seem to be solving a completely different problem related to scoring a sequence of characters ('@' and '*').

`func_1` appears to be calculating some kind of score based on a sequence of characters, where '@' increments the score and '*' marks an invalid state. `func_2` reads input, presumably from multiple test cases, and applies `func_1` to each test case's input, which is a string of space-separated integers, not a sequence of '@' and '*'.

The problem requires iterating through each test case, determining the year each sign occurs sequentially based on its periodicity, and then finding the year the nth sign occurs. This involves a completely different logic and data handling compared to what is implemented in the given functions.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect for the problem described.

Correctness: **False**
