Reasoning:  
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem described. The problem requires determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicity of each sign. The sequence of signs must occur sequentially, meaning that after the i-th sign occurs, the (i+1)-th sign must occur strictly after it.

However, the provided code seems to be solving a completely different problem related to a sequence of '@' and '*' characters, possibly counting the maximum number of '@' characters under certain conditions. This is evident from the function `func_1`, which processes a list of characters and uses dynamic programming to compute some value based on the presence of '@' and '*' characters.

The function `func_2` appears to be reading input and calling `func_1` with parts of the input, but since `func_1` is not relevant to the problem at hand, the overall program does not solve the required task.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the occurrence of each sign in sequence, keeping track of the current year and ensuring that each subsequent sign occurs strictly after the previous one. Here's an outline of how the correct solution might look:

1. For each test case, read the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
2. Initialize the current year to 0.
3. For each sign, find the next occurrence of the sign that is strictly after the current year.
4. Update the current year to this occurrence.
5. After processing all signs, the current year will be the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

Given the mismatch between the problem statement and the provided code, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
