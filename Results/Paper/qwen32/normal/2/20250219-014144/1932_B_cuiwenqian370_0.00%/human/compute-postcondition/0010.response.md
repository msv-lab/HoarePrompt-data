To determine the output state, we need to consider the given initial state and the effect of the provided Python code snippet.

Initial State:
- `path` is `'a_3'`
- `data` is a list of strings `['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']`
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `index` is 3
- `results` is an empty list
- `n` is the integer value of `a_2`

Code Snippet:
```python
results.append(func_1(path))
```

Impact of the Code:
- The function `func_1(path)` is called with `path` being `'a_3'`.
- The result of `func_1('a_3')` is appended to the `results` list.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific value returned by `func_1('a_3')`. However, we know that `results` will now contain one element, which is the return value of `func_1('a_3')`.

Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`path` is `'a_3'`; `data` is a list of strings `['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']`; `t` must be greater than 0; `index` is 3; `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1('a_3')`; `n` is the integer value of `a_2`.**
