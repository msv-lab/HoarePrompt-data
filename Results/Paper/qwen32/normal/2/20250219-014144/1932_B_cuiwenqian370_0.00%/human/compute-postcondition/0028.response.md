The only object in the loop head is the variable `result`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If there are more elements in the `results` list, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `result` is the second element of `results`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be a third element in the `results` list, and `result` should be set to this third element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`data` is a list of strings `['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']` where `a_1` is a valid integer such that `2*t` is a valid index in `data`, `t` is the integer value of `a_1`, `path` is `data[2*t]`, `index` is `1 + 2*t`, `results` is a list containing at least three elements, `result` is the third element of `results`**
