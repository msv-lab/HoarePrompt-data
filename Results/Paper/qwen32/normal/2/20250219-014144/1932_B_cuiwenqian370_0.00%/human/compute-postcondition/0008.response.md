The code snippet assigns the value of `data[index]` to `path`. Given that `index` is 2, `path` will now hold the value of `data[2]`, which is `'a_3'`.

Output State: **`path` is `'a_3'`; `data` is a list of strings ['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']; `t` must be greater than 0; `index` is 2; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `a_2`.**
