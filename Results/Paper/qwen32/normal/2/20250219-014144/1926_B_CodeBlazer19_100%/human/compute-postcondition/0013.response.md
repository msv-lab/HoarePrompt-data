Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the string read from input. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' and `b` remains an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` remains 0 and `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains no '1's, then both `a` remains 0 and `b` remains an empty string.**
