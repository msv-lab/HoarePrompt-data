Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is 0, `b` is '', `n` is the input integer, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` is greater than the new value of `i`, `j` is equal to the previous value of `n`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    s = input()
    if s.count('1') == 1:
        a = 'TRIANGLE'
    elif s.count('1') > 1:
        b = 'SQUARE'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0; `s` is the input string. If the count of '1' in `s` is exactly 1, then `a` is set to `'TRIANGLE'`. If the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1, then `b` is set to `'SQUARE'`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if the count of '1' in `s` is exactly 1, otherwise `a` remains unchanged, `b` is 'SQUARE' if the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1, otherwise `b` remains unchanged, and `j` is unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if the count of '1' in the original `s` was exactly 1, otherwise `a` remains unchanged, `b` is 'SQUARE' if the count of '1' in the original `s` was greater than 1, otherwise `b` remains unchanged, and `j` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
