The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. The values of `n`, `k`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `num` is determined based on whether `c` equals `r`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer read from the input (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5); `k` is the second integer read from the input (1 ≤ k ≤ n); each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `k` must be at least 1; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input; if `c` equals `r`, `num` is 2. Otherwise, `num` is 4; `i` is 4; `c` and `r` are the integers read from the input.**
