The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `m` must be at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4. The value of `m` remains unchanged as long as it is at least 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is `2k - count_equal`, `m` must be at least 2, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with the first element being 1, the third element being 3, all other elements initialized to 0 except `dp[i]` which is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `i` is 4**
