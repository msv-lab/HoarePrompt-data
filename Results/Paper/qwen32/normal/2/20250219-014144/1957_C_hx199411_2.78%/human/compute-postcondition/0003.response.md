The given code snippet reads two integers from the input, which represent the values of `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer between 1 and 300,000, and `k` is an integer between 0 and `n`.

After executing the code snippet, `n` and `k` are assigned the values read from the input. The other variables (`t`, the `r_i`, and `c_i` values) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer read from the input (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5); `k` is the second integer read from the input (0 ≤ k ≤ n); each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
