To determine the new state after executing the given line of code, we need to compute the value of `dp[i]` using the formula provided.

Given:
- `i` is 4.
- `dp` is a list where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[3]` is 7.

The formula to update `dp[i]` is:
\[ dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ dp[4] = (dp[3] + (4 - 1) \times dp[2] \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[4] = (7 + 3 \times 3 \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[4] = (7 + 18) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[4] = 25 \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[4] = 25 \]

All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer read from the input (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5); `k` is the second integer read from the input (0 ≤ k ≤ n); each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`; `i` is 4; `m` is at least 3; `m` is not equal to 1; `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, and `dp[4]` which is 25.**
