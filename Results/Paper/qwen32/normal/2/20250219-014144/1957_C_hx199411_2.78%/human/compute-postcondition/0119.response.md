To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

Given Initial State:
- `t` is 1
- `n` is the first integer read from the input
- `k` is the second integer read from the input
- `num` is `2k - count_equal`
- `m` must be at least 2
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with the first element being 1, the third element being 3, and all other elements initialized to 0

Code Snippet:
```python
dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

This line of code modifies the `dp` list at index `i`. The value at `dp[i]` is calculated based on the values at `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]`.

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we will assume `i` is a variable that has been defined elsewhere in the code and is within the bounds of the `dp` list (i.e., `2 <= i <= m`).

The formula used to update `dp[i]` is:
\[ dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]

Let's denote the new value of `dp[i]` as `new_dp_i`.

The Output State will reflect the updated value of `dp[i]` while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is `2k - count_equal`, `m` must be at least 2, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with the first element being 1, the third element being 3, all other elements initialized to 0 except `dp[i]` which is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`**

In natural language, the output state means that the value at index `i` of the `dp` list has been updated according to the given formula, while all other variables retain their original values.
