Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is `2k - count_equal`, `m` is either 1 or 5, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1`. If `m` is 1, `dp` has a length of 2 with `dp[1]` as 1 and `dp[2]` not yet calculated. If `m` is 5, `dp` is [1, 0, 3, 3, 27].**
