Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the pairs `(c, r)` read during the `k` iterations, `i` is `k`, `m` is `n - num` and `m` is not equal to 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, and `dp[2]` which is 3, and subsequent values computed using the loop formula.**
