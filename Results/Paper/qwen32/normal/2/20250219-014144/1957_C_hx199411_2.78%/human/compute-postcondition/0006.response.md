The code snippet reads a line of input containing two integers and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. The initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, `k`, and `num` are already defined with specific constraints. After executing the code, the values of `c` and `r` will be updated based on the input, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer read from the input (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5); `k` is the second integer read from the input (1 ≤ k ≤ n); each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `num` is 0; `k` must be at least 1; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input.**
