To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the variables evolve with each iteration based on the given conditions.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is the first integer read from the input
- `k` is the second integer read from the input
- `num` is 0
- `i` is `k + 1` if `m == 1`, otherwise `i` is `m + 1`
- `m` is `n - num`
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, and `dp[2]` which is 3, and subsequent values computed using the loop formula

### Loop Execution:
The loop runs `k` times. In each iteration, it reads two integers `c` and `r`. Depending on whether `c` equals `r`, it increments `num` by 1 or 2.

### Observations from Given States:
- After 1 iteration:
  - If `c == r`, `num` becomes 1.
  - If `c != r`, `num` becomes 2.
- After 2 iterations:
  - If `c == r` in both iterations, `num` becomes 2.
  - If one of the pairs has `c != r`, `num` becomes 3.
- After 3 iterations:
  - The value of `num` depends on the previous pairs. If all pairs have `c == r`, `num` is 3. If any pair has `c != r`, `num` is 6.

### Generalizing the Pattern:
- For each iteration where `c == r`, `num` increases by 1.
- For each iteration where `c != r`, `num` increases by 2.
- After `k` iterations, `num` will be the sum of 1s and 2s based on the pairs read.

### Final State Calculation:
After `k` iterations, `num` will be determined by the specific pairs of `c` and `r` read. However, the loop variable `i` is not used in the loop body and seems to be a misinterpretation since it is not updated within the loop. The correct interpretation should be that `i` is simply a loop counter running from 0 to `k-1`.

### Final Output State:
- `t` remains `t - 1`.
- `n` remains the first integer read from the input.
- `k` remains the second integer read from the input.
- `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the pairs `(c, r)` read during the `k` iterations.
- `i` is `k` (since it runs from 0 to `k-1`).
- `m` is `n - num`.
- `dp` remains as initially defined but is not modified in the loop.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the pairs `(c, r)` read during the `k` iterations, `i` is `k`, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, and `dp[2]` which is 3, and subsequent values computed using the loop formula.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` and `k` remain the same, `num` is the total increment based on the pairs `(c, r)`, `i` equals `k`, `m` is adjusted based on the final `num`, and `dp` remains as initially set.
