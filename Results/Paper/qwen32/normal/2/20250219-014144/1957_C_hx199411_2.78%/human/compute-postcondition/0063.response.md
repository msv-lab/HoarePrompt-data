Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the new state after executing the code.

Initial State:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is the first integer read from the input
- `k` is greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `m` is `n - num`
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, and `dp[2]` which is 3, and subsequent values computed using the loop formula
- `c` and `r` are the integers read from the second input pair
- If `c` equals `r`, `num` is 2; otherwise, `num` is 3

Code Snippet:
```python
num += 2
```

Impact of the Code:
- The value of `num` is incremented by 2.

Calculation:
- If initially `num` was 2 (when `c` equals `r`), then `num` becomes 4.
- If initially `num` was 3 (when `c` does not equal `r`), then `num` becomes 5.

Output State:
- `t` remains `t - 1`
- `n` remains the first integer read from the input
- `k` remains greater than 0
- `i` remains 1
- `m` changes to `n - (num + 2)` (since `num` has been incremented by 2)
- `dp` remains a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, and `dp[2]` which is 3, and subsequent values computed using the loop formula
- `c` and `r` remain the integers read from the second input pair
- `num` is now either 4 or 5 depending on whether `c` equals `r` or not

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is `n - (num + 2)`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, and `dp[2]` which is 3, and subsequent values computed using the loop formula, `c` and `r` are the integers read from the second input pair, `num` is either 4 or 5**
