The code snippet `dp[2] = 3` modifies the third element (index 2) of the list `dp` to be 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is `2k - count_equal`, `m` is `n - (2k - count_equal)`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with the first element being 1, the third element being 3, and all other elements initialized to 0.**
