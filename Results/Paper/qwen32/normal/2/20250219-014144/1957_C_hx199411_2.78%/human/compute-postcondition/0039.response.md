To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop progresses and modifies the `dp` array. The loop iterates from `i = 3` to `i = m`, updating the `dp` array according to the formula:

\[ \text{dp}[i] = (\text{dp}[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times \text{dp}[i - 2] \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]

From the given information, we know the state after the first three iterations:

- After 1 iteration: `dp[3] = 7`
- After 2 iterations: `dp[4] = 25`
- After 3 iterations: `dp[5] = 81`

We need to continue this process until `i = m`. Let's compute the next few values manually to identify a pattern or to reach the final value of `dp[m]`.

Let's calculate `dp[6]`:

\[ \text{dp}[6] = (\text{dp}[5] + 5 \times \text{dp}[4] \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ \text{dp}[6] = (81 + 5 \times 25 \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ \text{dp}[6] = (81 + 250) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ \text{dp}[6] = 331 \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ \text{dp}[6] = 331 \]

Next, let's calculate `dp[7]`:

\[ \text{dp}[7] = (\text{dp}[6] + 6 \times \text{dp}[5] \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ \text{dp}[7] = (331 + 6 \times 81 \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ \text{dp}[7] = (331 + 972) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ \text{dp}[7] = 1303 \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ \text{dp}[7] = 1303 \]

Continuing this process up to `dp[m]` would be tedious without automation, but we can infer that the final value of `dp[m]` will be the result of the last iteration of the loop.

Since the problem specifies that `m` is at least 3 and not equal to 1, and given the pattern, the final output state will have `dp[m]` computed as described above.

Thus, the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that
