The code snippet updates the value of `m` to `n - num`. Given that `num` is defined as `2k - count_equal`, the new value of `m` will be `n - (2k - count_equal)`. This means the value of `m` is recalculated based on the given formula.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `dp`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is `2k - count_equal`, `m` is `n - (2k - count_equal)`, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with `dp[1]` as 1, `dp[2]` as 3, and `dp[i]` for `i` from 3 to `m` updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` if `m` is greater than 1.**
