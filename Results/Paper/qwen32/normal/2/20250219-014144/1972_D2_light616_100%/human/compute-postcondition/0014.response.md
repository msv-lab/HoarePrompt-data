To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the `while` loop statement:

```
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means the loop will continue as long as both `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be at least 3.
- `m` must be at least 6.
- `x` is 1.
- `y` is 3.
- The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1.
- `cnt` is increased by `min(n // 3, m // 6)` if the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1.

Let's evaluate the current values of `x` and `y` against the conditions:
- `(x + y) * x = (1 + 3) * 1 = 4`
- `(x + y) * y = (1 + 3) * 3 = 12`

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. `(x + y) * x <= n` should be true, which means `4 <= n`. Since `n` must be at least 3, this condition is satisfied.
2. `(x + y) * y <= m` should be true, which means `12 <= m`. Since `m` must be at least 6, this condition is not necessarily satisfied.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `m` must be at least 12.

No other adjustments are necessary since the current values of `x` and `y` satisfy the first condition, and adjusting `m` to be at least 12 will satisfy the second condition.

State: **`n` must be at least 3, `m` must be at least 12, `x` is 1, `y` is 3, and the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1**.
