To determine the new state after executing the given code snippet, let's break down the operations:

Given:
- `n` must be at least 3
- `m` must be at least 6
- `x` is 1
- `y` is 2
- The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1

The operation to perform:
```python
cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
```

Let's substitute the known values of `x` and `y` into the expressions:
- `(x + y) * x` becomes `(1 + 2) * 1 = 3`
- `(x + y) * y` becomes `(1 + 2) * 2 = 6`

So the operation simplifies to:
```python
cnt += min(n // 3, m // 6)
```

Since `n` must be at least 3 and `m` must be at least 6, the minimum values for these expressions are:
- `n // 3` is at least `3 // 3 = 1`
- `m // 6` is at least `6 // 6 = 1`

Thus, `min(n // 3, m // 6)` will be at least 1. However, without specific values for `n` and `m`, we can't determine the exact value of `min(n // 3, m // 6)`. But we know `cnt` will be incremented by this minimum value.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `m` must be at least 6, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, and `cnt` is increased by `min(n // 3, m // 6)`**.
