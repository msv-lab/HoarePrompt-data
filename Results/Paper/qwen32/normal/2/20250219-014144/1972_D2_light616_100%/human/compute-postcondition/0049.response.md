To determine the new value of `cnt`, we need to evaluate the expression `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.

Given:
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 2
- `n` is at least 15
- `m` is at least 10
- The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1 (though this detail does not affect the calculation here)
- `cnt` is 11

First, calculate `(x + y) * x` and `(x + y) * y`:
- `(x + y) * x = (2 + 2) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8`
- `(x + y) * y = (2 + 2) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8`

Next, calculate `n // 8` and `m // 8`:
- Since `n` is at least 15, `n // 8` is at least `15 // 8 = 1`.
- Since `m` is at least 10, `m // 8` is at least `10 // 8 = 1`.

Thus, `min(n // 8, m // 8)` is at least `min(1, 1) = 1`.

Finally, update `cnt`:
- `cnt += 1` results in `cnt = 11 + 1 = 12`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 2, `n` is at least 15, `m` is at least 10, the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, and `cnt` is 12**.
