To determine the new value of `cnt`, we need to evaluate the expression `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.

Given:
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 3
- `cnt` is 7
- `n` must be at least 10
- `m` must be at least 15

First, let's calculate the denominators:
- `(x + y) * x` = `(2 + 3) * 2` = `5 * 2` = `10`
- `(x + y) * y` = `(2 + 3) * 3` = `5 * 3` = `15`

Next, we calculate the two terms inside the `min` function:
- `n // ((x + y) * x)` = `n // 10`
- `m // ((x + y) * y)` = `m // 15`

Since `n` must be at least 10, `n // 10` is at least 1.
Since `m` must be at least 15, `m // 15` is at least 1.

The exact values of `n // 10` and `m // 15` depend on the specific values of `n` and `m`, but both are integers and at least 1. To find the minimum of these two values, we need to consider the smallest possible values they can take given the constraints.

Let's assume the smallest possible values:
- `n` = 10, so `n // 10` = `10 // 10` = `1`
- `m` = 15, so `m // 15` = `15 // 15` = `1`

Thus, `min(n // 10, m // 15)` = `min(1, 1)` = `1`.

Finally, `cnt` is incremented by this minimum value:
- `cnt` = `7 + 1` = `8`

The other variables (`x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 3, `cnt` is 8, `n` must be at least 10, `m` must be at least 15**.
