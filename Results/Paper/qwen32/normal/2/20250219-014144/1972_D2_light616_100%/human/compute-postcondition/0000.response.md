Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. Each test case consists of two positive integers `n` and `m`, where 1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^6.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to be the integer value of the input, which represents the number of test cases. The conditions on `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged as they were part of the initial state description.
