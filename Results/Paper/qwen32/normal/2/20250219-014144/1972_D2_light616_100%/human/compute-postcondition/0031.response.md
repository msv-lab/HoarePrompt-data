To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the `while` loop head:

```
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

This means that for the loop to continue executing, both `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` must be true.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 3
- `cnt` is 7 if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` is 1, otherwise `cnt` remains 6. Since GCD(2, 3) = 1, `cnt` is 7.
- `n` must be at least 8.
- `m` must be at least 8.

Let's evaluate the conditions:
1. `(x + y) * x <= n` translates to `(2 + 3) * 2 <= n` which is `5 * 2 <= n` or `10 <= n`.
2. `(x + y) * y <= m` translates to `(2 + 3) * 3 <= m` which is `5 * 3 <= m` or `15 <= m`.

Since `n` must be at least 8 and `m` must be at least 8, these values are not sufficient to satisfy the conditions `10 <= n` and `15 <= m`. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` and `m` to meet these new requirements.

State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 3, `cnt` is 7, `n` must be at least 10, `m` must be at least 15**
