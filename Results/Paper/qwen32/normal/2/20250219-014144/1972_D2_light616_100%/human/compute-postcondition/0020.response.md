The only variable in the loop head is `n`, as the condition `x * x <= n` depends on `n`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `n` such that `x * x` (which is `2 * 2 = 4`) is still less than or equal to `n`.

Given that `x` is 2, `x * x` equals 4. Therefore, `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

Since the values of `x`, `y`, and `cnt` do not affect the loop condition, they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 5, `cnt` is 5, `n` must be at least 4**
