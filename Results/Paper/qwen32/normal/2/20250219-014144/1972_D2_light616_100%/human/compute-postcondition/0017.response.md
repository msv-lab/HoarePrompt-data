The value of `y` is incremented by 1. Given that `y` was initially 3, it is now 4. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` was initially 1, and since `x` remains 1 and `y` is now 4, their GCD is still 1. The other variables (`n`, `m`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `m` must be at least 12, `x` is 1, `y` is 4, and the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1. The variable `cnt` is increased by either 0 or 1.**
