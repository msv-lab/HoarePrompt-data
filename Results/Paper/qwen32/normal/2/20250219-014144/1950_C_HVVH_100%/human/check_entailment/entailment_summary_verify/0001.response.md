Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to verify its correctness based on the problem description.

### Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `day` is initialized to `'AM'`. This is fine as a default value, but it gets reassigned based on the hour value in each iteration.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of test cases `n` is read from the input.
   - A loop runs `n` times to process each test case.

3. **Splitting Time**:
   - For each test case, the time string `s` is split into hours `h` and minutes `m` using `map(int, input().split(':'))`.

4. **Converting Hours**:
   - If `h` is `0`, it is set to `12` and `day` is set to `'AM'`. This correctly handles midnight.
   - If `h` is greater than `12`, it is converted to 12-hour format by subtracting `12` from `h`, and `day` is set to `'PM'`.
   - If `h` is between `1` and `12`, `day` is set to `'AM'` unless `h` is exactly `12`, in which case `day` is set to `'PM'`. This correctly handles noon.
   - There is a redundancy in the original code where `day` is set to `'AM'` before checking if `h` is `12`. This can be simplified by rearranging the conditions.

5. **Printing Output**:
   - The formatted time string is printed using `f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}'` to ensure that both hours and minutes are displayed with two digits, followed by the appropriate period (`AM` or `PM`).

### Issues Found:
- The logic for setting the `day` variable when `h` is between `1` and `12` is correct, but the code unnecessarily sets `day` to `'AM'` before checking if `h` is `12`. This can be simplified by removing the redundant assignment.
- The original code handles all edge cases correctly, including midnight (`00:00`) and noon (`12:00`).

### Simplified Code:
While the original code is functionally correct, it can be slightly optimized for clarity:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h -= 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program correctly converts the given times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and handles all edge cases such as midnight (`00:00`) and noon (`12:00`). The minor redundancy in setting `day` does not affect the correctness of the program.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
