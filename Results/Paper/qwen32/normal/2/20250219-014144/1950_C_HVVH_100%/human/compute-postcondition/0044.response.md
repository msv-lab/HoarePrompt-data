Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (where 1 <= t <= 1440) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts a string `s` of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", where "hh" represents the hour from "00" to "23" and "mm" represents the minute from "00" to "59". The function returns a result for each test case based on the given time string.**
