The code sets the variable `day` to the string `'AM'`. The values of `t`, `s`, `h`, `m`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 with the format "hh:mm". `h` is the hour part of the input time string converted to an integer, `m` is the minute part of the input time string converted to an integer. `day` is 'AM', `n` is unchanged.**
