Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, and for each of the t test cases, there is a string s of length 5 with the format "hh:mm" where hh is a string representing the hour from "00" to "23" and mm is a string representing the minute from "00" to "59"; day is 'AM'; n is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
    if h == 0:
        h = 12
        day = 'AM'
    elif h > 12:
        h = h - 12
        day = 'PM'
    else:
        day = 'AM'
        if h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
    print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 with the format "hh:mm". If `h` (the hour part of the input time string converted to an integer) is 0, then `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'. If `h` is greater than 12, `h` is reduced by 12 and `day` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'PM'. Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM'. `n` is greater than 0, `h` is between 1 and 12 (inclusive), and `m` is the minute part of the input time string converted to an integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 with the format "hh:mm". `h` is the hour part of the input time string converted to an integer, and `m` is the minute part of the input time string converted to an integer. If the original `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is set to 'AM'. If the original `h` is greater than 12, `h` is reduced by 12 and `day` is set to 'PM'. If the original `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'PM'. Otherwise, `day` remains unchanged. `n` is unchanged throughout.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 with the format "hh:mm". `h` and `m` are the integer values extracted from the input string "hh:mm". If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'. If `h` > 12, `h` is updated to `h - 12` and `day` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'PM'. Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM'. `n` is unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
