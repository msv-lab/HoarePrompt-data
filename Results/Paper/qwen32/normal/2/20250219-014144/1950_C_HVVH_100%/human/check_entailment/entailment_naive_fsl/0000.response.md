Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case when the hour is exactly 12 correctly. Specifically, the program sets `day` to 'PM' only when `h > 12`. However, when `h` is 12, it should also be set to 'PM'. Additionally, the program incorrectly sets `day` to 'AM' when `h == 12`, which is incorrect because 12:00 in 24-hour format corresponds to 12:00 PM in 12-hour format.

Here's a specific case that demonstrates the issue:

- Input: `12:00`
- Expected Output: `12:00 PM`
- Actual Output: `12:00 AM` (incorrect)

To fix this, the condition for setting `day` to 'PM' should include the case when `h` is 12. Here is the corrected part of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

This modification ensures that the program correctly handles the edge case of 12:00 being PM.
