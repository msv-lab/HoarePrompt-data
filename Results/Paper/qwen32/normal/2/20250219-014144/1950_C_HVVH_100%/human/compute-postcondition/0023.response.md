Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 with the format "hh:mm". `h` is the hour part of the input time string converted to an integer minus 12, `m` is the minute part of the input time string converted to an integer. `day` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged.**

In simpler terms, the hour `h` has been reduced by 12, while all other variables remain unchanged.
