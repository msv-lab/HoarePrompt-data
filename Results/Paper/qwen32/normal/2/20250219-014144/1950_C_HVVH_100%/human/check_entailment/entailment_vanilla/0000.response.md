Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description:

1. **Initialization**: The variable `day` is initialized to `'AM'`. This is fine because we need to start with AM as the default period.

2. **Reading Input**: The number of test cases `n` is read from the input. Then, a loop runs `n` times to process each test case.

3. **Splitting Time**: For each test case, the time string `s` is split into hours `h` and minutes `m` using `map(int, input().split(':'))`.

4. **Converting Hours**:
   - If `h` is `0`, it is set to `12` and `day` is set to `'AM'`. This correctly handles midnight.
   - If `h` is greater than `12`, it is converted to 12-hour format by subtracting `12` from `h`, and `day` is set to `'PM'`.
   - If `h` is between `1` and `12`, `day` remains `'AM'` unless `h` is exactly `12`, in which case `day` is set to `'PM'`. This correctly handles noon.

5. **Printing Output**: The formatted time string is printed using `f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}'` to ensure that both hours and minutes are displayed with two digits, followed by the appropriate period (`AM` or `PM`).

### Issues Found:
- The logic for setting the `day` variable when `h` is between `1` and `12` is correct, but the code unnecessarily sets `day` to `'AM'` before checking if `h` is `12`. This can be simplified by removing the redundant assignment.
- However, the core logic for converting the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format appears to be correct.

### Simplified Code:
While the original code is functionally correct, it can be slightly optimized for clarity:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h -= 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program correctly converts the given times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and handles all edge cases such as midnight (`00:00`) and noon (`12:00`). Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
