The provided code snippet reads a string input in the format "hh:mm", splits it into two parts, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `h` and `m`. This means that `h` will now hold the hour part of the time and `m` will hold the minute part.

Given the initial state, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, there is a string `s` of length 5 with the format "hh:mm". However, the code snippet only processes one instance of such a string, so we'll focus on the changes made to `h` and `m`.

The other variables (`t`, `s`, `day`, `n`) remain unchanged by this snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 with the format "hh:mm". `h` is the hour part of the input time string converted to an integer, `m` is the minute part of the input time string converted to an integer. `day` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged.**
