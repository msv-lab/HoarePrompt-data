Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of time strings to process. For each of the `n` time strings in the format "hh:mm" (where "hh" is the hour from "00" to "23" and "mm" is the minute from "00" to "59"), it converts the time to a 12-hour format with the appropriate AM/PM designation and prints the result. The original input values remain unchanged.**
