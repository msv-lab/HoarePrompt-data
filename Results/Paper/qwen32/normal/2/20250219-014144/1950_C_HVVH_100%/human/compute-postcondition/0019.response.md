The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a common placeholder indicating that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. The loop runs `n` times, so to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop progresses.

Given that the loop runs `n` times, the loop will execute as long as the number of iterations is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have completed one of its iterations. Therefore, the loop counter (which is represented by `_` but is essentially an internal counter managed by Python) would have incremented by 1.

Since `_` is not modified or used within the loop, we don't need to change its value explicitly in the state description. However, conceptually, the loop counter has increased by 1, meaning that one more iteration has been completed.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same in terms of the variables we are concerned with (`t`, `s`, `h`, `m`, `day`, and `n`), except that the loop is ready to execute its next iteration because the internal counter has incremented.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 with the format "hh:mm". If `h` (the hour part of the input time string converted to an integer) is 0, then `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'. If `h` is greater than 12, `h` is reduced by 12 and `day` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'PM'. Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM'. `n` is greater than 0, `h` is between 1 and 12 (inclusive), and `m` is the minute part of the input time string converted to an integer.**
