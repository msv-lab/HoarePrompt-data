Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `day` is initialized to `'AM'`. This is fine since we'll update it based on the hour value.
   
2. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of test cases `n` is read.
   - For each test case, the input string is split into hours `h` and minutes `m`.

3. **Conversion Logic**:
   - If `h` is 0, it is set to 12, and `day` is set to `'AM'`.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, it is converted to the 12-hour format by subtracting 12, and `day` is set to `'PM'`.
   - Otherwise, `day` is set to `'AM'`. However, there's an additional check that if `h` is 12, `day` is set to `'PM'`.

4. **Output**:
   - The time is printed in the format `hh:mm AM` or `hh:mm PM`, ensuring that both `h` and `m` are printed with leading zeros using `f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}'`.

### Issues Identified:
- The logic for setting `day` when `h` is 12 is incorrect. According to the problem statement, 12:00 should be "12:00 PM", but the current logic sets it to "12:00 AM".
- There's no need to reset `day` to `'AM'` when `h` is not greater than 12, because it could already be `'PM'` from a previous iteration.

### Corrected Code:
Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        if h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has a logical error in handling the conversion of 12-hour format, particularly for the hour 12. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **False**
