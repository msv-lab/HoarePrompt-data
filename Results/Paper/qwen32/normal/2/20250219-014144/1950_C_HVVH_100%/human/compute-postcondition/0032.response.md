The given code snippet reads a string input in the format "hh:mm" and splits it into two integers, `h` (hour) and `m` (minute). This affects the values of `h` and `m` but does not change the values of `t`, `s`, `day`, or `n`.

Here's the updated state:

- `h` and `m` are now the integer values extracted from the input string "hh:mm".
- `t`, `s`, `day`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 with the format "hh:mm". `h` and `m` are the integer values extracted from the input string "hh:mm". `day` is unchanged. `n` is unchanged.**
