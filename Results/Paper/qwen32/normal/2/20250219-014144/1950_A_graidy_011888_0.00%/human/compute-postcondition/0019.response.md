To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `x`, `y`, and `z` are random integers between 1 and 9.
- The variable `res` is determined based on the conditions involving `x`, `y`, and `z`, but it is not used in the `print` statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement outputs the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`, separated by spaces.
- Since `x`, `y`, and `z` are random integers between 1 and 9, their exact values cannot be determined without additional information.
- However, we know that each of these variables will hold a value within the range 1 to 9.

### Conclusion:
Given the randomness of `x`, `y`, and `z`, the exact values printed will vary each time the code is run. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the given information.

### Final Output:
Output: **x y z (where x, y, and z are random integers between 1 and 9)**
