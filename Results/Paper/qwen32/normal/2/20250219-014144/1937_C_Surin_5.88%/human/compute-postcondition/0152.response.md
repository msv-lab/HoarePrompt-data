The provided code snippet only contains `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the output buffer. This operation does not affect any of the variables in the initial state.

Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `I`, `R`, `g`, `prev`, `i`, `kp`, `v2`, `v1`) are modified by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function, `R` is a lambda function, `g` is 0, `prev` is the highest index i for which the response r was '>', `i` is n-1, `kp` is 2, `v2` is n-1, and `v1` is the highest index i for which the response r was '<' or 0 if no such i was found.**
