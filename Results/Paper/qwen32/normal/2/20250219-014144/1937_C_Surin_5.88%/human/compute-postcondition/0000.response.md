The given code snippet defines a lambda function `I` that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list.

Since the code does not execute the lambda function, no immediate changes occur to the variables `t` or `n`, nor is the sequence `p` altered. The lambda function `I` is merely defined and not called.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with the addition of the defined lambda function `I`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴. The sequence `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}. `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list.**
