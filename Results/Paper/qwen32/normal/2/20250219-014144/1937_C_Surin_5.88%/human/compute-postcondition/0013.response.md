Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, `g` is 0. If `r` equals '<', then `v1` is set to `v2` and `v2` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged.**
