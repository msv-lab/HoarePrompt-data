To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³
- `n` is greater than 1
- `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}
- `I` is a lambda function
- `R` is a lambda function
- `g` is 0
- `prev` is the largest index `i` for which the response `r` was `>` during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` was found
- `i` is `n-2`
- `kp` is 2
- `v2` is `n-2`
- `v1` is `n-1` if `r` is `<`. If `r` is not `<`, the state of the variables remains unchanged as per the precondition.

Since the loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n-1`, the next value of `i` should be `i + 1`. Given that `i` is currently `n-2`, the next value of `i` should be `n-1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` is `n-1`

All other variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `I`, `R`, `g`, `prev`, `kp`, `v2`, `v1`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}, `I` is a lambda function, `R` is a lambda function, `g` is 0, `prev` is the largest index `i` for which the response `r` was `>` during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` was found, `i` is `n-1`, `kp` is 2, `v2` is `n-2`, and `v1` is `n-1` if `r` is `<`. If `r` is not `<`, the state of the variables remains unchanged as per the precondition.**
