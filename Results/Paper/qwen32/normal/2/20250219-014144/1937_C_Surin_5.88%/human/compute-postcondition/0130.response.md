The code snippet simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `prev`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}, `I` is a lambda function, `R` is a lambda function, `g` is 0, `prev` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `kp` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, and `v1` is the highest index `i` for which the response `r` was `'<'` or `0` if no such `i` was found.**
