The code snippet provided reads an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `r`. None of the other variables are modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` must be greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}, `I` is a lambda function, `R` is a lambda function, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `prev` is the largest index `i` for which the response `r` was `>` during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` was found, `i` is `n-1`, `kp` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the input received from the user.**
