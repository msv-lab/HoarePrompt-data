The code snippet `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` to `v1`. Given the initial state, `v2` is `n-1`. Therefore, `v1` will also be `n-1`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Here's the updated state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}, `I` is a lambda function, `R` is a lambda function, `g` is 0, `prev` is the largest index `i` for which the response `r` was `>` during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` was found, `i` is `n-1`, `kp` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`. `r` is the input value.**
