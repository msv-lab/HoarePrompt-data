Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the new input integer, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., new `n`-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `prev` is the last index i for which r == '>' was observed, or 0 if no such i was found, `i` is the new input integer, `kp` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    v2 = i
    print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    r = input('')
    if r == '<':
        v1 = v2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the new input integer `i` if `r` equals '<', otherwise `v1` remains 0, `prev` is the last index `i` for which `r == '>'` was observed, or 0 if no such `i` was found, `i` is the new input integer, `kp` is 1, `v2` is the new input integer `i`, `r` is the input string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the new input integer `i` if `r` equals '<', otherwise `v1` remains 0, `prev` is the last index `i` for which `r == '>'` was observed, or 0 if no such `i` was found, `i` is the new input integer + 1, `kp` is 1, `v2` is the new input integer `i`, `r` is the input string. Specifically, if `r` equals '<', `v1` is set to the new input integer `i`; otherwise, `v1` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the new input integer `i` if `r` equals '<', otherwise `v1` remains 0, `prev` is the last index `i` for which `r == '>'` was observed, or 0 if no such `i` was found, `i` is the new input integer + 1, `kp` is 1, `v2` is the new input integer `i`, `r` is the input string. Specifically, if `r` equals '<', `v1` is set to the new input integer `i`; otherwise, `v1` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
