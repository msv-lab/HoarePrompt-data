To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³. This variable does not affect the print statement directly.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}.
- `I` and `R` are lambda functions, but they are not used in the print statement.
- `g` is initialized to 0.
- `v1` is the largest index `i` for which the response `r` was `<` during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` was found.
- `prev` is the largest index `i` for which the response `r` was `>` during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` was found.
- `i` is initialized to `n-1`.
- `kp` is initialized to 1.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
```

Based on the initial state, `prev` and `v1` are both initialized to 0 unless modified during the loop iterations. Since there is no information provided about the loop iterations or any modifications to `prev` and `v1`, we assume they retain their initial values.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **! 0 0**
