The code snippet `prev = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `prev`. Given that `i` is 1, `prev` will now also be 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}, `I` is a lambda function, `R` is a lambda function, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index `i` for which the response `r` was `<` during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` was found, `prev` is 1, `i` is 1, `kp` is 1, and the current value of `r` is `'>'`.**
