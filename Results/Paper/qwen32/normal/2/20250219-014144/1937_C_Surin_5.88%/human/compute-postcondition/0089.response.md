To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³. This variable does not directly influence the print statement.
2. **n**: Greater than 1. This defines the size of the permutation `p`.
3. **p**: A permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}. This permutation is not directly used in the print statement.
4. **I**: A lambda function. Its definition is not provided, so we cannot determine its impact on the print statement.
5. **R**: Another lambda function. Its definition is not provided, so we cannot determine its impact on the print statement.
6. **g**: Initialized to 0. This variable does not directly influence the print statement.
7. **v1**: The largest index `i` for which the response `r` was `<` during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` was found. Since there is no information about previous loop iterations, we assume `v1` is 0.
8. **prev**: Set to 1 if `r` is `'>'`, otherwise remains 0. Since `r` is not specified, we assume `prev` is 0.
9. **i**: Initialized to 2. This variable is directly used in the print statement.
10. **kp**: Initialized to 1. This variable does not directly influence the print statement.
11. **r**: The user input. This variable does not directly influence the print statement.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

Given the initial state:
- `v1` is assumed to be 0 (since no previous loop iterations are mentioned).
- `i` is 2.
- `prev` is assumed to be 0 (since `r` is not specified).

### Substituting Values:
Substituting these values into the print statement, we get:
```python
print(f'? 0 2 0 0')
```

### Final Output:
Output: **? 0 2 0 0**
