The code snippet `n = int(input())` changes the value of `n` to whatever integer is read from the input. This means the previous value of `n` (which was stated to be an integer greater than 1) is overwritten by the new input value.

Other variables remain unchanged:
- `t` is still an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `p` is still a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1} (though the set size now corresponds to the new `n`).
- `I` and `R` are still lambda functions defined for reading input.
- `g` is still 0.
- `v1` is still the largest index i for which r == '<' was observed during the loop iterations.
- `prev` is still the last index i for which r == '>' was observed, or 0 if no such i was found.
- `i` is still `n` (but note that the old `n` is now replaced by the new input value).
- `kp` is still 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the new input integer, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., new `n`-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index i for which r == '<' was observed during the loop iterations, `prev` is the last index i for which r == '>' was observed, or 0 if no such i was found, `i` is the new input integer, `kp` is 1.**
