To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³ (not directly relevant to the current print statement).
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}.
- `I` and `R` are lambda functions (not directly relevant to the current print statement).
- `g` is 0.
- `prev` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `kp` is 2.
- `v2` is `n-1`.
- `v1` is the highest index `i` for which the response `r` was `'<'` or `0` if no such `i` was found.

Given this information, let's break down the print statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

From the initial state:
- `v1` is described as the highest index `i` for which the response `r` was `'<'` or `0` if no such `i` was found. Since there is no mention of any responses `r` being `'<'` before this point, we assume `v1` is `0`.
- `i` is explicitly stated to be `1`.
- `prev` is explicitly stated to be `0`.

Substituting these values into the print statement, we get:
```python
print(f'? 0 1 0 0')
```

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 1 0 0**
