Postcondition: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, `char` is the next character in `password`. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list that includes the original elements plus `char`, and `letters` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `digits` remains unchanged, and `letters` now includes the character `char` appended to it.**
