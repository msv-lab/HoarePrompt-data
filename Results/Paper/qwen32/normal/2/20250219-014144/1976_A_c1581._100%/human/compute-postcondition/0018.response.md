The code sorts the `letters` list. The `password`, `digits`, and `n` remain unchanged. The `letters` list, which originally contained all the letters from the `password` string, is now sorted alphabetically.

Output State: **password is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; digits is a sorted list containing all the digits from the password string; letters is a sorted list containing all the letters from the password string.**
