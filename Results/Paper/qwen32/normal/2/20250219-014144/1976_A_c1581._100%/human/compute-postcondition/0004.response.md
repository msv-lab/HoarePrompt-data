The code appends the character `char` to the list `digits`. Since `digits` initially contains at least one element (`char`), after appending `char` again, `digits` will contain at least two elements, both of which are `char`.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`; `digits` is a list containing at least two elements, specifically the digit `char` appended twice; `letters` is an empty list.**
