Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The main issues lie in the `func_1` function and how the output is generated.

### Issues in `func_1`:
1. **Logic Error**: The function `func_1` does not correctly check if all possible subsequences of length `n` exist in the string `s`. Instead, it attempts to remove characters from a set of the first `k` letters and appends characters to `s1` and `s2` based on this logic. This approach does not ensure that all possible subsequences are checked.
2. **Subsequence Check**: The function does not perform a proper check to see if a specific subsequence exists in `s`. It only checks if characters are present and does not consider the order or combination of characters required for subsequences.

### Issues in Output Generation:
1. **Generating Missing Subsequence**: The code attempts to generate a missing subsequence by finding a character not in `s1` and repeating it. However, this does not guarantee that the generated string is not a subsequence of `s`.
2. **Case Sensitivity**: The problem specifies that "YES" and "NO" can be printed in any case, but the code uses "No" which is not consistent with the problem's requirements.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, one needs to:
- Generate all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- Check if each subsequence exists in the string `s`.
- If a subsequence does not exist, output "NO" followed by that subsequence.
- If all subsequences exist, output "YES".

Given the constraints, generating all possible subsequences and checking each one in `s` is feasible because the maximum number of subsequences is `k^n`, which is manageable for `k <= 26` and `n <= 26`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem, hence the correctness is False.
