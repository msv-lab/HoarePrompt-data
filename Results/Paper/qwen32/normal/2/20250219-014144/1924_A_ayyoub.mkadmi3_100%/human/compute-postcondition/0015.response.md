The code snippet `s2 += i` appends the value of `i` to the string `s2`. The other variables (`s`, `m`, `k`, `alphabet`, `s1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `m` (where `m` is at least 1) consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the next character in `s`, `s1` and `s2` are determined based on the new `i` and `alphabet`, `alphabet` is determined based on the new `i`, `s2` now includes the character `i` appended to it.**
