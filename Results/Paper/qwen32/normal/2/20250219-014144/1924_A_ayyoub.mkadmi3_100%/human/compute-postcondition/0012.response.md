Postcondition: **`s` is a string of length `m` (where `m` is at least 1) consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If `i` is in `alphabet`, then `s1` is the string containing the character `i`. If the length of `alphabet` is not 1, `s2` is an empty string and `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets except for `i`. If the length of `alphabet` is 1, `s2` is the string containing the character `i` and `alphabet` is a set containing only the character `i`. If `i` is not in `alphabet`, `s1` and `s2` remain empty strings and `alphabet` remains unchanged.**
