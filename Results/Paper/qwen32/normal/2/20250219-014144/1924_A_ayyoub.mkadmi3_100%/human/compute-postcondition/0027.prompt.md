Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 1000; `k` is the number of different lowercase English alphabets used; `n` is the length of the strings to check; `s1` is an empty string; `s2` is an empty string; `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i in alphabet:
        if len(alphabet) != 1:
            alphabet.remove(i)
        else:
            s2 += i
            alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
        s1 += i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a string of length `m` (where `m` is at least 1) consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If `i` is in `alphabet`, then `s1` is the string containing the character `i`. If the length of `alphabet` is not 1, `s2` is an empty string and `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets except for `i`. If the length of `alphabet` is 1, `s2` is the string containing the character `i` and `alphabet` is a set containing only the character `i`. If `i` is not in `alphabet`, `s1` and `s2` remain empty strings and `alphabet` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a string of length `m` (where `m` is at least 1) consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the next character in `s`. If `i` is in `alphabet`, `s1` includes the character `i` appended to its previous value, and `s2` is determined based on the new `i` and `alphabet`. If `len(alphabet) != 1`, `alphabet` is updated to exclude `i`; otherwise, `alphabet` is reset to the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If `i` is not in `alphabet`, no changes are made to `s1`, `s2`, or `alphabet`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a string of length `m` (where `m` is at least 1) consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the next character in `s`. If `i` is in `alphabet`, `s1` includes `i` appended to its previous value, and `s2` also includes `i` appended to its previous value. If `i` is not in `alphabet`, `s1` includes `i` appended to its previous value, and `s2` remains unchanged. `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
