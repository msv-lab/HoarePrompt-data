The code snippet `s1 += i` appends the character `i` to the string `s1`. The other variables (`s`, `m`, `k`, `i`, `s2`, and `alphabet`) remain unchanged unless `i` is part of `alphabet`.

Given the initial state, `s1` is updated to include the character `i` appended to its previous value. The other variables retain their original states.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `m` (where `m` is at least 1) consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the next character in `s`, `s1` is updated to include `i` appended to its previous value, `s2` is updated to include `i` appended to its previous value if `i` is in `alphabet`, otherwise `s2` remains unchanged, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.**
