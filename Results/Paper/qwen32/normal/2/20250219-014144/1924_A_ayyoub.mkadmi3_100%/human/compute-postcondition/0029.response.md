Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, the substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end, and the string `s2`.**

To break it down:
- The first element of the tuple is a boolean value (`True` or `False`) that indicates whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`.
- The second element is a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1`.
- The third element is the string `s2`, which contains characters from `s` that caused the `alphabet` to reset.
