The code snippet `s1 += i` appends the character `i` to the string `s1`. Since `s1` was initially an empty string, after executing this line, `s1` will contain the single character `i`.

The other variables (`s`, `m`, `k`, `s2`, and `alphabet`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`s` is a string of length `m` (where `m` is at least 1) consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `s1` is the string containing the character `i`, `i` is in `alphabet`. If the length of `alphabet` is not 1, then `s2` is an empty string and `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets except for `i`. If the length of `alphabet` is 1, then `s2` is the string containing the character `i` and `alphabet` is a set containing only the character `i`.**
