To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses and modifies the `ans` list over each iteration. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

### Loop Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n`, `k`, and `x`: Integers read from the input.
   - `a`: A reversed (descending) list of `n` integers read from the input.
   - `sum1`: The sum of the elements in `a`.
   - `ans`: An initially empty list.

2. **Loop Iteration**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = k`.
   - For `i = 0`:
     - `sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`
     - Append `sums` to `ans`.
   - For `i > 0`:
     - If `i + x - 1 < n`:
       - Update `sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`
       - Append `sums` to `ans`.
     - Else:
       - Update `sums = sums + a[i - 1]`
       - Append `sums` to `ans`.

### Final Output State

After the loop completes all `k + 1` iterations, the `ans` list will contain `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` is computed based on the rules outlined above.

### Output State Description

- `t`: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `n`, `k`, and `x`: Remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- `a`: Remains unchanged as it is only read within the loop.
- `sum1`: Remains unchanged as it is only read within the loop.
- `ans`: Contains `k + 1` elements, where each element is calculated based on the current value of `i` and the conditions specified in the loop.

### Final Output State in Required Format

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed (now descending) list of `n` integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements where each element is calculated based on the rules specified in the loop.**

In simpler terms, the final output state includes the original values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a`, the sum of the elements in `a` (`sum1`), and a list `ans` with `k + 1` elements computed according to the loop logic.
