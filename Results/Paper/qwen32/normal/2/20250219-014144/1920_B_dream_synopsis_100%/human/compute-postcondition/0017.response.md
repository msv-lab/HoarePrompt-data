The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. No other variables are modified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed (now descending) list of `n` integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element `sums`, `i` is not equal to 0, `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, and `sums` is equal to `a[i - 1]`.**
