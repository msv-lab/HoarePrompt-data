The code appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input with `k` being at least 0, `a` is a new list of `n` integers read from the input and sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `i` is not equal to 0, `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, and `sums` is the previous value of `sums` plus `a[i - 1]`.**
