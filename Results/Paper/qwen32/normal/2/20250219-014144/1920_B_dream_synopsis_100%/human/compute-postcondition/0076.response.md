Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers with `k` being at least 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is 4. `ans` is a list containing the original value of `sums` and the updated value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[3] - 2 * a[x + 2]`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[2]`. If `i + x - 1 < n`, `ans` contains the original `sums`, the updated `sums + a[3] - 2 * a[x + 2]`, and the final `sums + a[2] - 2 * a[x + 2]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, `ans` contains the original `sums` and the updated `sums + a[2]`.**
