The given code calculates `sums` as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. This means `sums` is derived from subtracting twice the sum of the first `x` elements of the list `a` from `sum1`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `sums`. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed (now descending) list of `n` integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is `i + 2`. If `i == 0`, `ans` is a list containing two elements `[sums, sums]` where `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, `ans` is a list containing two elements, the first being `sums` and the second being `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, `ans` is a list containing two elements `[sums + a[i - 1], sums]`. `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
