The code snippet `sums = sums + a[i - 1]` updates the value of `sums` by adding the element at index `i - 1` from the list `a` to the current value of `sums`.

Given the initial state, `i` is 4. Therefore, `i - 1` equals 3. This means the element at index 3 of the list `a` (which is `a[3]`) will be added to `sums`.

Thus, the new value of `sums` will be `sums + a[3]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers with `k` being at least 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is 4, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[3]`. If `i == 0`, `ans` is a list containing the values `[sums, sums]` where `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing the original value of `sums` and the updated value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[2] - 2 * a[x + 2]`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[2]`.**
