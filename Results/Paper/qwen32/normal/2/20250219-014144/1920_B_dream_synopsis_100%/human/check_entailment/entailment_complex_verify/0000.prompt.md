You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have an array a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n . The
game consists of two steps:

  * First, Alice will remove at most k elements from the array. 
  * Second, Bob will multiply at most x elements of the array by -1 . 

Alice wants to maximize the sum of elements of the array while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both
players play optimally.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and x (1 \leq
n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq x,k \leq n ) — the number of elements in the
array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove,
and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1
to.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 1000 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of elements of the array
after the game if both players play optimally.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove the only element of
the array. Then, the sum of elements of the array is 0 after the game is over.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Alice to not remove any elements.
Bob will then multiply 4 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
3+1+2-4=2 .

In the fifth test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove 9, 9 . Bob will then
multiply 5, 5, 3 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
-5-5-3+3+3+2=-5 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Analysis

The goal is to simulate a game where Alice removes up to `k` elements from the array and then Bob flips the sign of up to `x` elements to minimize the sum. Alice aims to maximize the sum after both moves.

#### Key Points:
1. **Sorting**: The array is sorted in descending order to prioritize larger elements for Alice's removal.
2. **Sum Calculation**: The initial sum is calculated, and adjustments are made based on the number of elements removed by Alice and flipped by Bob.
3. **Looping through Possible Moves**: The loop iterates through possible numbers of elements Alice could remove (`i`), adjusting the sum accordingly and considering Bob's optimal moves.

#### Potential Issues:
1. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program needs to handle cases where `k` or `x` are equal to `n`, meaning Alice or Bob can remove or flip all elements.
2. **Correct Sum Adjustments**: The sum adjustments must correctly account for the elements removed by Alice and the elements flipped by Bob.
3. **Optimal Moves**: The program must ensure that Bob's moves are optimal, i.e., flipping the smallest remaining elements to minimize the sum.

### Testing the Program

Let's consider a few test cases to see if the program behaves as expected.

#### Test Case 1:
```
1
4 1 1
3 1 2 4
```
- Alice removes 1 element (optimal to remove the smallest, which is 1).
- Remaining array: `[3, 2, 4]`
- Bob flips the smallest element (1 is already removed, so he flips 2).
- Resulting array: `[3, -2, 4]`
- Sum: `3 - 2 + 4 = 5`
- Expected: `2` (removing 4 and flipping 1 gives `3 + 1 + 2 = 6`; removing 3 and flipping 1 gives `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`; removing 2 and flipping 1 gives `3 + 4 + 1 = 8`; removing 1 and flipping 2 gives `3 + 4 - 2 = 5`; removing 1 and flipping 1 gives `3 + 2 + 4 = 9`; optimal is removing 4 and flipping 1).

#### Test Case 2:
```
1
6 6 3
1 4 3 2 5 6
```
- Alice removes all elements.
- Resulting array: `[]`
- Sum: `0`
- Expected: `0` (correct)

#### Test Case 3:
```
1
8 5 3
5 5 3 3 3 2 9 9
```
- Alice removes 5 elements (optimal to remove the largest 5, which are `9, 9, 5, 5, 3`).
- Remaining array: `[3, 3, 2]`
- Bob flips the smallest 3 elements.
- Resulting array: `[-3, -3, -2]`
- Sum: `-8`
- Expected: `-5` (removing `9, 9, 5, 5, 3` leaves `[3, 3, 2]`; flipping `3, 3, 2` gives `[-3, -3, -2]` but flipping `3, 3, 5` gives `[-3, -3, -5]` and sum is `-11`; flipping `3, 3, 6` gives `[-3, -3, -6]` and sum is `-12`;
