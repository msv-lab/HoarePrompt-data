The given code calculates a new variable `sums` based on the existing variables `sum1` and `a`. Specifically, it subtracts twice the sum of the first `x` elements of the list `a` (which is already reversed and sorted) from `sum1`.

Here's the updated state after executing the code:

- `t` remains an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1.
- `n`, `k`, and `x` remain integers read from the input.
- `a` remains a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input.
- `sum1` remains the sum of the elements in the original `a`.
- `ans` remains an empty list.
- The current value of `i` remains 0.
- A new variable `sums` is introduced and calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
