The code calculates a new value for `sums` by subtracting twice the sum of the first `x` elements of the list `a` from `sum1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, and `a` is sorted in descending order, `sum(a[:x])` computes the sum of the top `x` largest elements in `a`.

Therefore, the new value of `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers with `k` being at least 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `i` is 3, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
