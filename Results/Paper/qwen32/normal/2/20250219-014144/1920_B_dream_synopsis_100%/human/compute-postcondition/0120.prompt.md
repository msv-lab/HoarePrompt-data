Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, k, and x are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n. The array a contains n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    a.reverse()
    sum1 = sum(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(k + 1):
        if i == 0:
            sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])
            ans.append(sums)
        elif i + x - 1 < n:
            sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
            ans.append(sums)
        else:
            sums = sums + a[i - 1]
            ans.append(sums)
    print(max(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed (now descending) list of `n` integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements where each element is calculated based on the rules specified in the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers with `k` being at least 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` values of `sums` computed as per the loop logic.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` values of `sums` computed during each iteration, and `sums` holds the value computed in the last iteration (`i = k`).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
