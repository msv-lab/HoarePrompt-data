Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed (now descending) list of `n` integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `i` is not equal to 0, and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`; `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `sums` is added to the list `ans`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
