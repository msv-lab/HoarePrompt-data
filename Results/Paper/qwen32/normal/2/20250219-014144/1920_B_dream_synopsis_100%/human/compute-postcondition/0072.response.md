Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers with `k` being at least 0
- `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`
- `i` is 4
- If `i == 0`, `ans` is a list containing the values `[sums, sums]` where `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing the original value of `sums` and the updated value of `sums`.
- If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[2] - 2 * a[x + 2]`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[2]`.

Code Snippet:
```python
sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
```

Impact of the Code:
- The variable `sums` is updated using the formula `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
- Given `i` is 4, the term `a[i - 1]` translates to `a[3]` (since indexing starts from 0).
- The term `a[i + x - 1]` translates to `a[3 + x - 1]` which is `a[x + 2]`.

Therefore, the new value of `sums` is `sums + a[3] - 2 * a[x + 2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers with `k` being at least 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is 4, `ans` is a list containing the original value of `sums` and the updated value of `sums`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[3] - 2 * a[x + 2]`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `sums` is adjusted by adding the fourth element of `a` and subtracting twice the element at position `x + 2` in `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
