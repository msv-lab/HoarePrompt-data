Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` and possibly other previous sums, `i` is `i + 1`. If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`. In both cases, `ans` now includes the newly appended value of `sums`.**
