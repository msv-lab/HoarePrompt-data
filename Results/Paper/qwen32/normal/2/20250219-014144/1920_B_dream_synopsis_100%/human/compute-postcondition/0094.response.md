The code appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n`, `k` must be at least 0, `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `i` is not equal to 0, `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
