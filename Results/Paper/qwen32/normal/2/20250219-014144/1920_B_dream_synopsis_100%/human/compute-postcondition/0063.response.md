To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

The code snippet is:
```python
sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
```

Given Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers with `k` being at least 0
- `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`
- `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`
- `i` is 3

The line of code modifies the value of `sums` by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`.

Let's break down the changes:
- `i` is 3, so `a[i - 1]` is `a[2]` (the third element in the list `a`).
- `a[i + x - 1]` is `a[3 + x - 1]` which simplifies to `a[x + 2]` (the element at index `x + 2` in the list `a`).

Thus, the new value of `sums` is:
```python
sums = sums + a[2] - 2 * a[x + 2]
```

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers with `k` being at least 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `i` is 3, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[2] - 2 * a[x + 2]`.**
