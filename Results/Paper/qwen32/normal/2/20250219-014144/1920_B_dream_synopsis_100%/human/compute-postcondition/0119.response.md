To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans))` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the context:

1. **Variables and their descriptions:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\). This seems to be a loop counter or test case identifier but does not directly affect the computation of `max(ans)`.
   - `n`, `k`, `x`: Integers read from the input.
   - `a`: A reversed sorted list of integers read from the input.
   - `sum1`: The sum of the elements in the original `a` list.
   - `ans`: A list containing `k + 1` values of `sums` computed during each iteration.
   - `sums`: Holds the value computed in the last iteration (`i = k`).

2. **Understanding `ans` and `sums`:**
   - `ans` is a list that stores `k + 1` sums. Each sum is computed in an iterative process where `sums` is updated in each iteration.
   - Since `ans` contains `k + 1` values, it implies there are `k + 1` iterations in total.

3. **What `max(ans)` computes:**
   - `max(ans)` finds the maximum value among all the sums stored in the `ans` list.
   - Each element in `ans` is a computed `sums` value from each iteration.

Given this information, the output of `print(max(ans))` will be the highest value among all the sums computed during the iterations.

Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, `x`, and the elements of `a` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `max(ans)`. However, we know that `max(ans)` will be one of the values in the `ans` list, which is the largest sum computed during the iterations.

Therefore, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **max(ans) (where max(ans) is the maximum value among all the sums computed during the iterations)**
