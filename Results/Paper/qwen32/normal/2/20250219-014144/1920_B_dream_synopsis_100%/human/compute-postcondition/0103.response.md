To determine the new state after executing the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the changes:

The code snippet modifies the variable `sums` by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified.

Given:
- `sums` is updated.
- `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers.
- `i` is incremented by 1 before this operation, so `i` is used as `i - 1` and `i + x - 1` in the current operation.

The new value of `sums` will be `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `i` is incremented by 1, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
