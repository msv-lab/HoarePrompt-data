The given code snippet sorts the list `b`. Since `b` was already sorted with `b[ma]` incremented by 3, sorting it again will not change its order. Therefore, the only variable that might seem to be affected is `b`, but since it was already sorted and then sorted again, its state remains effectively unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000, `case` is an input string, `op` is 3, `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 3, `median` is `median`, `new_median` is `b[ma] + 2`**.
