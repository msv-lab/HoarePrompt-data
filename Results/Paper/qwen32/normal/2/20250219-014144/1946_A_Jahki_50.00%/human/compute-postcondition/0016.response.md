Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a`. If `num2` is even, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1`. Otherwise, `num2` is odd, and `ma` is the integer part of `num2 / 2`.**
