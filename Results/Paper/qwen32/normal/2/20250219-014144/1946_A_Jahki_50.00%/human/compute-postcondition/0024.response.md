To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop condition. The loop condition is `while new_median <= median:`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `new_median` is less than or equal to `median` for the loop to continue executing.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`
- `num` is greater than 0
- `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000
- `case` is an input string
- `op` is 1
- `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1
- `median` is `median + 1`
- `new_median` is `b[ma]`

We need to adjust `new_median` and/or `median` to satisfy the condition `new_median <= median`.

Since `new_median` is defined as `b[ma]` and `median` is `median + 1`, the current state already satisfies `new_median <= median` because `b[ma]` (which is `new_median`) is less than or equal to `median + 1` (which is `median`). 

However, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we should confirm that `new_median` can indeed be less than or equal to `median` after the next iteration. Since `median` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, we need to ensure that `new_median` does not exceed `median` in the next iteration. This means `new_median` should remain less than or equal to `median` after the increment.

Therefore, no further adjustment is needed based on the given information, as the current state already satisfies the loop condition.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000, `case` is an input string, `op` is 1, `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1, `median` is `median + 1`, `new_median` is `b[ma]`**
