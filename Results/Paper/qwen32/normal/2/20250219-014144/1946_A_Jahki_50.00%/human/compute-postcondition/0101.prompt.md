Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `num` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    op = 0
    if num2 > 10000:
        print(1)
        print(16668)
        break
    else:
        a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
        b = sorted(a)
        if num2 % 2 == 0:
            ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1
        else:
            ma = int(num2 / 2)
        median = b[ma]
        new_median = median
        while new_median <= median:
            b[ma] += 1
            op += 1
            b = sorted(b)
            new_median = b[ma]
        print(op)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is either 0 or the number of times the loop ran. If `num2` is greater than 10000, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, `op` is the number of times the loop ran, `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented until `new_median` is greater than `median`, `median` is `median_initial`, and `new_median` is `median_initial + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string, `i` is `i + 1`. If `num2` > 10000, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `op` is the original value of `b[ma]` + 1, `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by the number of iterations, `median` is the original value of `b[ma]`, `new_median` is `b[ma]` + 1, and `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the new input string, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `num2` > 10000, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `op` is 4, `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 4, `median` is `b[ma] - 1`, `new_median` is `b[ma]`, and `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
