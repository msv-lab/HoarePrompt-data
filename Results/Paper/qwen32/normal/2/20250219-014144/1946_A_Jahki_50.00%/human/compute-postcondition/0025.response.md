The given code snippet increments the value of `b[ma]` by 1. Since `b` is already defined as the sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1 in the initial state, executing `b[ma] += 1` again will further increment `b[ma]` by 1.

Given that `new_median` is defined as `b[ma]` in the initial state, and `median` is `median + 1`, after the execution of `b[ma] += 1`, both `b[ma]` and `new_median` will increase by 1.

Therefore, the updated output state will reflect these changes:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000, `case` is an input string, `op` is 1, `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 2, `median` is `median + 1`, `new_median` is `b[ma]` which is now `b[ma] + 1`.**
