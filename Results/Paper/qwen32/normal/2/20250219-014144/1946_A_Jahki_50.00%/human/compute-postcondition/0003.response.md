The code snippet provided only includes an input statement which reads a value from the user and assigns it to the variable `case`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, or `num2`. The variable `case` is introduced and assigned the value of the user input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `num` must be greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string.**
