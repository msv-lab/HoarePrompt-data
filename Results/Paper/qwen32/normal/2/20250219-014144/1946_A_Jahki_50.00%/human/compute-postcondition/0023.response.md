The given code snippet assigns the value of `b[ma]` to `new_median`. Since `b` is already defined as the sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1, and `new_median` was previously stated to be greater than `median`, the new value of `new_median` will be the value of `b[ma]`.

Given that `b[ma]` has already been incremented by 1, the updated `new_median` will reflect this increment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000, `case` is an input string, `op` is 1, `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1, `median` is `median + 1`, `new_median` is `b[ma]`**.
