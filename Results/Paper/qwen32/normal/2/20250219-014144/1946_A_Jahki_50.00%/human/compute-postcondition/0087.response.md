The code snippet updates the value of `new_median` to be equal to `b[ma]`. Since `ma` is already defined as `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, or `int(num2 / 2)` if `num2` is odd, the value of `new_median` will be the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `new_median`. All other variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers parsed from the input string `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the new input string, `i` is `i + 1`, `op` is 1, `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1, `median` is `b[ma] + 1`, `new_median` is `b[ma]`, and `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`**.
