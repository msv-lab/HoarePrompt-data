The code snippet increments the variable `op` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers parsed from `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string, `op` is 2, `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1, `median` is `b[ma] - 2` (before the latest increment), `new_median` is `b[ma]` (after the latest increment), `i` is `i + 1`, and `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`**.
