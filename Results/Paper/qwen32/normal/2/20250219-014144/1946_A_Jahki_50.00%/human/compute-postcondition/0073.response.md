The `print(1)` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. The value to be printed is explicitly specified as `1`.

Here's the breakdown:
- The initial state provides details about several variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `num2`, `case`, `i`, `op`, `b`, `median`, `new_median`, `ma`), but none of these variables are used in the `print(1)` statement.
- The `print(1)` statement directly outputs the integer `1`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
