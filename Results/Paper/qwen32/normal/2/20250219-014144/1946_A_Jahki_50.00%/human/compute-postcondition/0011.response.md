The code snippet sorts the list `a` and assigns the sorted list to `b`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `num`, `num2`, `case`, or `op`. The only change is that `b` now holds the sorted version of the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a`.**
