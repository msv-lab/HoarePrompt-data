The code snippet provided increments the value of `op` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers parsed from the input string `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the new input string, `i` is `i + 1`, `op` is 3, `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 3, `median` is `b[ma] + 1`, `new_median` is `b[ma]`, and `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`**.
