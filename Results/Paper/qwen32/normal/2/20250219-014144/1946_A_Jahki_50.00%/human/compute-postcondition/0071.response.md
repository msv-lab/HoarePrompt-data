The code snippet only updates the value of `case` by reading an input string. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the new input string, `i` is `i + 1`. If `num2` > 10000, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `op` is the original value of `b[ma]` + 1, `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by the number of iterations, `median` is the original value of `b[ma]`, `new_median` is `b[ma]` + 1, and `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`**.
