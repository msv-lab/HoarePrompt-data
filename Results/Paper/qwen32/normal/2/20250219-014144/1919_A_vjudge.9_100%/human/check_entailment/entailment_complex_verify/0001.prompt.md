You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from input; the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd; `i` has reached the value of `t` and the loop has terminated. Regardless of whether the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd, `i` has completed all `t` iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then prints "Bob" if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, otherwise it prints "Alice".


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic behind the game and see if the program correctly implements that logic.

### Game Analysis:
The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns exchanging wallets and removing one coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a move loses. Both players play optimally, meaning they make moves that maximize their chances of winning.

Let's consider the possible scenarios:

1. **If `a == b`:**
   - Both players have the same number of coins. No matter how they exchange wallets, they will always end up in a situation where they both have the same number of coins. Eventually, both will run out of coins at the same time, but since Bob makes the last move when `a` and `b` become 0, Bob wins.

2. **If `a != b`:**
   - If the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position. She can always ensure that after her turn, the difference remains odd. This means that eventually, Bob will be left with no coins while Alice still has one, making Alice the winner.
   - If the difference between `a` and `b` is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves and force Alice into a losing position. He can ensure that after his turn, the difference remains even. This means that eventually, Alice will be left with no coins while Bob still has one, making Bob the winner.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets (`a` and `b`). It then checks whether the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd using the condition `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`.

- If the difference is even (`abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`), it prints "Bob".
- If the difference is odd (`abs(a - b) % 2 != 0`), it prints "Alice".

This logic aligns perfectly with our game analysis. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
