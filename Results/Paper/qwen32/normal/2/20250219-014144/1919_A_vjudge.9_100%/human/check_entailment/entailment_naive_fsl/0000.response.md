Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The game involves Alice and Bob taking turns to either swap wallets or not, and then removing one coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a move loses. Both players play optimally.

The key observation here is that the game's outcome depends on whether the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd:
- If the difference is even, Bob wins.
- If the difference is odd, Alice wins.

This is because:
- When the difference is even, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position.
- When the difference is odd, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position.

### Program Analysis

The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. It then checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd and prints "Bob" if even and "Alice" if odd.

Here is the provided program for reference:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

### Verification

The program correctly implements the logic described above. It calculates the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, checks if it is even or odd, and prints the winner accordingly.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, we can conclude that it correctly handles all possible cases as per the problem description. There are no edge cases that the program fails to address.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly determines the winner based on whether the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd. This aligns with the optimal strategy described in the problem statement.
