In the given initial state, the variables `t`, `a`, and `b` are defined with specific constraints. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet does not depend on these variables. It simply prints the string `'Bob'`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from input.
- The absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd.

Despite these conditions, the `print` statement is straightforward and does not involve any calculations or conditions based on `t`, `a`, or `b`.

Therefore, the output will be the string `'Bob'`.

Output: **Bob**
