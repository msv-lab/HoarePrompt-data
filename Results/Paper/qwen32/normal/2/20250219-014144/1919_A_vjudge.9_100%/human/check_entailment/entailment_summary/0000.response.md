### Reasoning:

The game described involves Alice and Bob taking turns to either swap wallets or remove a coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a move loses. The key insight here is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even nature) of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

Let's analyze why the program works:

1. **Initial Setup**: The game starts with Alice and Bob having `a` and `b` coins respectively.
2. **Turns and Moves**: On each turn, a player can either swap wallets or remove a coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a move (i.e., when both wallets are empty) loses.
3. **Optimal Play**: Both players play optimally. This means they will always make moves that maximize their chances of winning.

The critical observation is:
- If the absolute difference `|a - b|` is even, Bob wins.
- If the absolute difference `|a - b|` is odd, Alice wins.

This can be reasoned through the following points:
- When `|a - b|` is even, after each optimal move, the parity of the difference remains even. This eventually leads to a situation where both wallets have the same number of coins, and since Alice starts, Bob ends up making the last move, leading to Bob's win.
- When `|a - b|` is odd, after each optimal move, the parity of the difference remains odd. This ensures that Alice can always force Bob into a losing position, leading to Alice's win.

Thus, the program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the absolute difference between `a` and `b`.
