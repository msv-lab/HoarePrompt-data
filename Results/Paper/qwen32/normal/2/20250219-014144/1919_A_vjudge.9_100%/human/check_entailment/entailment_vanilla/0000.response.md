To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic behind the game and see if the program correctly implements that logic.

### Game Analysis:
The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns exchanging wallets and removing one coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a move loses. Both players play optimally, meaning they make moves that maximize their chances of winning.

Let's consider the possible scenarios:

1. **If `a == b`:**
   - Both players have the same number of coins. No matter how they exchange wallets, they will always end up in a situation where they both have the same number of coins. Eventually, both will run out of coins at the same time, but since Bob makes the last move when `a` and `b` become 0, Bob wins.

2. **If `a != b`:**
   - If the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position. She can always ensure that after her turn, the difference remains odd. This means that eventually, Bob will be left with no coins while Alice still has one, making Alice the winner.
   - If the difference between `a` and `b` is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves and force Alice into a losing position. He can ensure that after his turn, the difference remains even. This means that eventually, Alice will be left with no coins while Bob still has one, making Bob the winner.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets (`a` and `b`). It then checks whether the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd using the condition `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`.

- If the difference is even (`abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`), it prints "Bob".
- If the difference is odd (`abs(a - b) % 2 != 0`), it prints "Alice".

This logic aligns perfectly with our game analysis. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
