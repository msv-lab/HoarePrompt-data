### Reasoning

The original assessment appears to be accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step using the problem description, the provided program, and the annotated code.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice and Bob take turns.
- Each turn, a player can either swap wallets or not, and then remove one coin from their current wallet.
- The player who cannot make a move loses.
- Both players play optimally.

#### Key Insight:
- The game's outcome is determined by the parity (even or odd nature) of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
- If the difference is even, Bob wins.
- If the difference is odd, Alice wins.

#### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case:
1. Reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets (`a` and `b`).
2. Computes the absolute difference `abs(a - b)`.
3. Checks if the difference is even (`abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`):
   - If true, prints "Bob".
   - Otherwise, prints "Alice".

#### Annotations:
The annotations confirm that the program reads the input correctly, computes the absolute difference, and prints the correct winner based on the parity of the difference.

#### Verification:
- The program correctly implements the logic derived from the problem statement.
- It handles all possible cases within the given constraints.
- The annotations support the correctness of the program's behavior.

#### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program accurately determines the winner of the game for each test case based on the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. There are no identified issues or edge cases that the program fails to address.
