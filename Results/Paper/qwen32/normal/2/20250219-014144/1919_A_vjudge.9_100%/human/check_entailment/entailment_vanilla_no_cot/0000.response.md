To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic behind the game and see if it matches the program's decision-making process.

### Game Analysis:
- Alice and Bob take turns removing a coin from their current wallet.
- They can choose to swap wallets before removing a coin.
- The player who cannot make a move loses.

### Key Insight:
- The game essentially revolves around the parity (odd or even nature) of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
- If the difference `(a - b)` is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves and force Alice into a losing position.
- If the difference `(a - b)` is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob with an even difference, ensuring Alice's victory.

### Explanation of the Program:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the number of coins `a` and `b` in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
- It checks if the absolute difference `abs(a - b)` is even or odd.
- If the difference is even, it prints "Bob".
- If the difference is odd, it prints "Alice".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the strategy based on the parity of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
