The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `a`, and `b`, but it does not affect the execution of the `print` statement directly. The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'Alice'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is an integer read from input, with the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This variable represents the number of test cases or iterations, but it is not used in the given `print` statement.
2. The variables `a` and `b` are integers read from input. The absolute difference between `a` and `b` is described as being either even or odd, but this detail also does not influence the `print` statement.
3. The `print` statement is straightforward and outputs the string `'Alice'`.

Given this information, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
