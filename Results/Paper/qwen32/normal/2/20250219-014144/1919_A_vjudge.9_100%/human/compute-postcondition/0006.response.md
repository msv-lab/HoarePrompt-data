Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from input.
- The absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('Alice')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'Alice'`. There are no variables or conditions in the `print` statement itself that depend on the values of `t`, `a`, or `b`.

### Explanation:
The value to be printed is explicitly given in the `print` statement. It does not change based on the values of `t`, `a`, or `b`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Alice**
