### Reasoning:

To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the game mechanics and the logic implemented in the code.

#### Game Mechanics:
1. **Initial Setup**: Alice starts with `a` coins, and Bob starts with `b` coins.
2. **Turns**: Players alternate turns, starting with Alice.
3. **Moves**:
   - Each player can choose to swap wallets or not.
   - After potentially swapping, the player removes one coin from their current wallet.
4. **Winning Condition**: The player who cannot make a move (i.e., whose wallet is empty when it's their turn) loses.

#### Optimal Strategy:
The optimal strategy revolves around the parity (even or odd nature) of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets (`|a - b|`).

- **Even Difference (`|a - b| % 2 == 0`)**:
  - If the difference is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves to ensure that he never faces a situation where he has to make a move when his wallet is empty.
  - Example: If `a = 4` and `b = 2`, Alice can swap or not, but Bob can always adjust his move to keep the difference even, eventually forcing Alice into a losing position.
  
- **Odd Difference (`|a - b| % 2 != 0`)**:
  - If the difference is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob with an even difference, putting Bob in a losing position.
  - Example: If `a = 5` and `b = 3`, Alice can swap or not, but she can always adjust her move to leave Bob with an even difference, eventually forcing Bob into a losing position.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code correctly implements the logic based on the parity of the difference between `a` and `b`:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```
- **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the number of coins `a` and `b`.
- **Calculating Parity**: It calculates the absolute difference `|a - b|` and checks if it is even or odd.
- **Printing Result**: Based on the parity, it prints "Bob" if the difference is even and "Alice" if the difference is odd.

Given the analysis of the game mechanics and the optimal strategies, the code correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the optimal strategies derived from the game mechanics.

Final: **True**
