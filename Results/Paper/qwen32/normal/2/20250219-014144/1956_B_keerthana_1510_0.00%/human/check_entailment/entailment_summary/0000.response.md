### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided solution.

#### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective**: Determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally.
- **Game Rules**:
  - There are `2n` cards, with each integer from 1 to `n` appearing exactly twice.
  - Cards are distributed equally between two players.
  - Players take turns placing cards on the table.
  - A player scores a point if they place a card that matches a card already on the table.
  - Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

#### Key Points:
- Since each integer appears exactly twice, each card can only contribute to one point in total (either you or Nene will score it).
- The strategy involves understanding how to maximize your points while Nene plays optimally against you.

#### Solution Analysis:
- The provided solution calculates the sum of the integer division of the count of each unique card by 3.
- This logic seems flawed because:
  - Each card appears exactly twice, so `elements.count(item)` will always be either 1 or 2.
  - Dividing 1 or 2 by 3 results in 0, which means the entire sum will always be 0 regardless of the input.

#### Correct Approach:
- To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the distribution of cards and the optimal strategies of both players.
- The key insight is that you can only score points when you place a card that matches a card already on the table.
- Given that Nene plays optimally, she will try to prevent you from scoring points whenever possible.
- The correct approach involves counting pairs of cards you have and determining how many of those pairs can be matched optimally.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It incorrectly assumes that dividing the count of each unique card by 3 will yield the maximum points you can achieve, which is not the case.

**Correctness: False**
