Let's break down the given Python code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- The input file has at least three lines.
- The first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5).
- The second line contains `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times.
- The third line exists and is properly formatted.
- `elements` is a list of strings representing the substrings from `line` split by whitespace.
- `line` is the line at position `k+2` in the input file.

### Code Analysis:
```python
print(sum(elements.count(item) // 3 for item in {*elements}))
```

#### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **`elements` List**: This list contains substrings from `line` split by whitespace. Since `line` is the line at position `k+2` in the input file, `elements` will be the words or numbers in that line.
   
2. **Set Comprehension `{*elements}`**: This creates a set of unique items from the `elements` list. Since sets do not allow duplicate entries, this set will contain each unique substring from `elements`.

3. **Counting Occurrences**: For each unique item in the set `{*elements}`, the code counts how many times it appears in the `elements` list using `elements.count(item)`.

4. **Integer Division by 3**: The count of each unique item is then divided by 3 using integer division (`//`). This means that if an item appears less than 3 times, the result will be 0. If it appears 3 times, the result will be 1, and so on.

5. **Summing Up**: The results of these divisions are summed up using the `sum()` function.

### What Will Be Printed:
The code calculates the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique item in `elements` by 3. Given that each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times in the second line of the input file, none of these integers can appear 3 times or more in any other line (since the second line already uses up their maximum occurrences).

Thus, for every unique item in `elements`, the count will be either 0, 1, or 2, and dividing any of these by 3 using integer division will yield 0. Therefore, the sum of these divisions will always be 0.

### Final Output:
Output: **0**
