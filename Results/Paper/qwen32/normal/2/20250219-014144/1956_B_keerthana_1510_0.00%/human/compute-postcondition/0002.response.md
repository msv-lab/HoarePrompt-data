Let's break down the code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- The input file has at least three lines.
- The first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5).
- The second line contains `n` integers where each integer from 1 through n appears at most 2 times.
- The third line exists and is properly formatted.
- `elements` is a list of strings representing the integers from the second line of the input file.

### Code Analysis:
```python
print(sum(elements.count(item) // 3 for item in {*elements}))
```

#### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Set Comprehension `{*elements}`**:
   - This creates a set of unique elements from the `elements` list.
   - Since each integer from 1 through n appears at most 2 times in the `elements` list, the set will contain each unique integer exactly once.

2. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - For each unique item in the set, `elements.count(item)` counts how many times that item appears in the `elements` list.
   - Given the precondition, this count will be either 1 or 2 because each integer appears at most 2 times.

3. **Integer Division by 3**:
   - Each count (which is either 1 or 2) is then divided by 3 using integer division (`// 3`).
   - Integer division of 1 by 3 results in 0.
   - Integer division of 2 by 3 also results in 0.

4. **Summing the Results**:
   - The `sum` function adds up all the results of the integer divisions.
   - Since each count divided by 3 results in 0, the sum will be 0 regardless of the number of unique elements.

### Conclusion:
Given the constraints and the operations performed, the sum of the integer divisions will always be 0.

### Final Output:
Output: **0**
