The code appends the value of `v` to the `tree` deque. This means that `tree` now contains the elements `u` and `v`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 2, `t` is an integer read from the input, the tree described by the edges has exactly two leaves, `tree` is a deque containing the elements `u` and `v`, `empty` is False, `u_1` (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) represents the initial node where the stone is placed, `u` and `v` are a pair of integers read from the input.**
