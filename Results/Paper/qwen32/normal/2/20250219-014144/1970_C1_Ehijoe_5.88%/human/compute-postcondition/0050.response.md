Postcondition: **`n` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 2, `t` is an integer read from the input, the tree described by the edges has exactly two leaves, `empty` is False, `u_1` (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) represents the initial node where the stone is placed, `u` and `v` are a pair of integers read from the input, `i` is 2. If `u` equals the first element of `tree`, `v` is appended to the left end of `tree`. If `u` equals the last element of `tree`, `v` is appended to the end of `tree`.**
