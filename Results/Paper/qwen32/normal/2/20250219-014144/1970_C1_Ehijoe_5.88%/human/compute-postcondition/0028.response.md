The code appends the value of `u` to the list `tree`. This means that the list `tree` now includes the new element `u`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 2, `t` is an integer read from the input, the tree described by the edges has exactly two leaves, `empty` is False, `u_1` (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) represents the initial node where the stone is placed, `u` and `v` are a pair of integers read from the input, `tree` has an additional element `u` appended to it, `i` is 1.**
