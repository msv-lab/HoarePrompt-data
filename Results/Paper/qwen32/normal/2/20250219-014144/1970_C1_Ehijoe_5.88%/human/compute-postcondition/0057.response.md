The code snippet calculates the minimum number of moves required to reach the start index from either end of the deque `tree`. The variable `moves` is a list that stores these two minimum values.

Given the initial state, `moves` is now calculated as `[min(t, idx), min(t, n - idx - 1)]`.

Here, `t` is not defined in the initial state, so we will keep it as `t`. `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, and `n` is the length of `tree`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`tree` is a deque containing all nodes in the order forming a path from one leaf to the other leaf of the tree, `empty` is `False`, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, `moves` is `[min(t, idx), min(t, n - idx - 1)]`.**

This means that `moves` now holds the calculated minimum distances from the start index to either end of the deque `tree`.
