Postcondition: **`n` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 2, `t` is an integer read from the input, the tree described by the edges has exactly two leaves, `tree` is a non-empty deque with `v` as its last element, `empty` is False, `u_1` (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) represents the initial node where the stone is placed, and `u` and `v` are a pair of integers read from the input, with `v` not equal to the first element of `tree`. The current value of `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`.**
