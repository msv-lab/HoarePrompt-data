Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer read from the input, `t` is an integer read from the input, the tree described by the edges has exactly two leaves, and the edges are provided as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n. Additionally, there is a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the initial node where the stone is placed. `tree` is an empty deque. `empty` is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    u, v = map(int, input().split())
    if empty:
        tree.append(u)
        tree.append(v)
        empty = False
    elif v == tree[0]:
        tree.appendleft(u)
    elif v == tree[-1]:
        tree.append(u)
    elif u == tree[0]:
        tree.appendleft(v)
    elif u == tree[-1]:
        tree.append(v)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 2, `t` is an integer read from the input, the tree described by the edges has exactly two leaves, `empty` is False, `u_1` (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) represents the initial node where the stone is placed, and `u` and `v` are a pair of integers read from the input. If `empty` was initially True, `tree` is now a deque containing the elements `u` and `v`. If `empty` was initially False, `tree` remains unchanged unless `u` is equal to the first element of `tree` and `v` is not equal to the first or last element of `tree`, in which case `tree` becomes a deque containing the single element `v` at the front. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree` and `v` is not equal to the first or last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains `[v]`. In all other cases, `tree` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 2, `t` is an integer read from the input, the tree described by the edges has exactly two leaves, `empty` is False, `u_1` (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) represents the initial node where the stone is placed, `u` and `v` are a pair of integers read from the input, `i` is 1. If `empty` is True, `tree` has an additional element `u` and `v` appended to it. Otherwise, if `v` equals the first element of `tree`, `tree` has `u` as its first element followed by the previous elements of `tree`. If `v` equals the last element of `tree`, `u` is appended to `tree`. If `u` equals the first element of `tree`, `v` is added to the beginning of `tree`. If `u` equals the last element of `tree`, `v` is appended to `tree`. Otherwise, `tree` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 2, `t` is an integer read from the input, the tree described by the edges has exactly two leaves, `empty` is False, `u_1` (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) represents the initial node where the stone is placed, `u` and `v` are a pair of integers read from the input, `i` is 2. If `empty` were True, `tree` would now include `v` as its last element. Since `empty` is False, if `v` equals the first element of `tree`, `tree` has `u` as its first element followed by the previous contents of `tree`. Otherwise, if `v` equals the last element of `tree`, `tree` contains the value of `u` appended to it. If `u` equals the first element of `tree`, `v` is appended to the left end of `tree`. If `u` equals the last element of `tree`, `v` is appended to the end of `tree`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
