The code appends the value of `u` to the left end of the `tree` deque. Since `tree` was initially empty, after appending `u`, `tree` will contain one element, which is `u`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 2, `t` is an integer read from the input, the tree described by the edges has exactly two leaves, `tree` is a deque containing `[u]`, `empty` is False, `u_1` (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) represents the initial node where the stone is placed, `u` and `v` are a pair of integers read from the input, and `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`.**
