Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial integer input. For each iteration, the program reads six integers `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb`. If `xa > xb`, it prints "Draw". Otherwise, it calculates `x` as `abs(xa - xb) // 2`. Depending on whether `abs(xa - xb)` is odd or even, it sets `l` and `r` accordingly and checks if certain conditions related to `ya` and `yb` are met to determine whether to print "Alice" or "Bob". After all iterations, no further changes are made to the variables, and the program ends.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all `t` iterations, the program will have processed each set of inputs (`h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`) according to the specified logic, printing either "Draw", "Alice", or "Bob" for each set. No further modifications are made to the variables once all iterations are complete.
