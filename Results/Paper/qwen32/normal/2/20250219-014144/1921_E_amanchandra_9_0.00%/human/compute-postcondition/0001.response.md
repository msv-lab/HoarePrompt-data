The code reads six integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb`. The initial state only specifies that `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Since `t` is not used in the given code snippet, its value remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers read from the input.**
