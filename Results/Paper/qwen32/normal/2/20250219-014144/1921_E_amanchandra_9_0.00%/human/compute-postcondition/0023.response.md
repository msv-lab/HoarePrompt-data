Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers read from the input; `x` is `abs(xa - xb) // 2`; `l` is `max(1, ya - x)`; `r` and `i` are unchanged.**

In natural language: The value of `l` is updated to be the maximum of 1 and `ya - x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
