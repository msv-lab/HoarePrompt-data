### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program and compare it to the rules of the game described in the problem statement.

1. **Initial Conditions and Moves**:
   - Alice starts at `(x_a, y_a)` and can move down, down-left, or down-right.
   - Bob starts at `(x_b, y_b)` and can move up, up-left, or up-right.
   - The game ends when a player lands on the same cell as the other player, or when a player cannot make a move.

2. **Winning Conditions**:
   - Alice wins if she can land on Bob's cell.
   - Bob wins if he can land on Alice's cell.
   - The game is a draw if neither player can force a win.

3. **Optimal Play**:
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move to win or avoid losing.

4. **Logic in the Code**:
   - The code first checks if `xa > xb`. If so, it prints "Draw". This condition seems incorrect because it does not consider the actual positions and movements of the players.
   - If `xa <= xb`, it calculates `x` as `abs(xa - xb) // 2`. This value represents half the vertical distance between Alice and Bob.
   - Depending on whether the vertical distance is odd or even, it sets `l` and `r` to define a range of columns where Alice or Bob can potentially move to capture the other player.
   - It then checks if Alice or Bob can move within these ranges to capture the other player.

### Analysis of the Code Logic:
- The condition `if xa > xb: print('Draw')` is incorrect. The game should not end in a draw just because Alice's initial row is greater than Bob's. The game's outcome depends on the actual positions and possible moves.
- The logic for determining the winner is flawed. The code does not correctly account for all possible scenarios where Alice or Bob can capture the other player based on their optimal moves.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly determine the winner or a draw based on the optimal play of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
