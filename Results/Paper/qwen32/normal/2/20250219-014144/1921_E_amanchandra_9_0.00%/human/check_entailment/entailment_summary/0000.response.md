### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

1. **Initial Check for Immediate Draw**:
   - The program starts by checking if `xa > xb`. If true, it prints "Draw". This condition is intended to handle scenarios where Alice's chip is initially below Bob's chip vertically. However, this check alone does not cover all scenarios where a draw might occur. For instance, if Alice and Bob are in the same column and Alice is below Bob, but Alice cannot move because she is in the last row, this should also result in a draw. Thus, this condition seems insufficient and potentially incorrect.

2. **Calculating Distance and Range**:
   - The variable `x` is calculated as the integer division of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` by 2. This value represents half the vertical distance between Alice and Bob.
   - Depending on whether the difference in `x` coordinates is odd or even, the program calculates the leftmost (`l`) and rightmost (`r`) columns within which Alice or Bob can move to potentially capture each other.

3. **Checking Capture Conditions**:
   - If the difference in `x` coordinates is odd, the program checks if Alice can move to a position within the calculated range `[l, r]` such that she can capture Bob. If yes, it prints "Alice"; otherwise, it prints "Draw".
   - If the difference in `x` coordinates is even, the program checks if Bob can move to a position within the calculated range `[l, r]` such that he can capture Alice. If yes, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Draw".

### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Initial Draw Check**: The initial check `if xa > xb` is too simplistic and does not correctly identify all scenarios where a draw occurs.
- **Logic for Determining Capture**: The logic for determining whether Alice or Bob can capture each other based on the calculated ranges and distances seems flawed. Specifically, the conditions `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x` do not accurately reflect the rules of movement and capture in the game.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues, particularly the incorrect initial draw check and the flawed logic for determining capture, the program does not correctly implement the rules of the game as described in the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
