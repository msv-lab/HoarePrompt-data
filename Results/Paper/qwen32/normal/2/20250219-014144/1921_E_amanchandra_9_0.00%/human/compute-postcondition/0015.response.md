Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers read from the input. If `xa` is greater than `xb`, no additional changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`; `x` is set to `(xb - xa) // 2`. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, `l` is set to `max(1, yb - x)` and `r` is set to `min(w, yb + x)`. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even, `l` is set to `max(1, ya - x)` and `r` is set to `min(w, yb + x)`**.
