The given Python code snippet creates a string `result` by joining the elements of the list `permutation` with spaces. This operation does not alter the values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `idx`, `idx_v`, `curr_v`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i`, `i`). It only introduces a new variable `result`.

Given the initial state, the only change is the introduction of the variable `result`, which holds the space-separated string representation of the list `permutation`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values 1 through `n` distributed according to the pattern described above; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `n + 1`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is the last position updated in the final iteration; `i` is `k-1`; `result` is a space-separated string of the elements in `permutation`.**
