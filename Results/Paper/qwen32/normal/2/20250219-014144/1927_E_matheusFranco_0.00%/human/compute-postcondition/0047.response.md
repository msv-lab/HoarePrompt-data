Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values 1, 2, ..., `floor(n/k)` at positions 0, `k`, `2k`, ..., `(floor(n/k) - 1) * k`, `floor(n/k) + 1` at position 1, `floor(n/k) + 2` at position `k + 1`, ..., `floor(n/k) + floor((n-1)/k)` at position `(floor((n-1)/k) - 1) * k + 1`, and 0 elsewhere except `permutation[2]` which is `floor(n/k) + floor((n-1)/k) + 1` and `permutation[2 + k]` which is `floor(n/k) + floor((n-1)/k) + 2` and `permutation[2 + 2*k]` which is `floor(n/k) + floor((n-1)/k) + 3`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `floor(n/k) + floor((n-1)/k) + 4`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2 + 2*k`; `i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 6.`**

In simple terms, the only change is that `curr_v` has been incremented by 1, making its new value `floor(n/k) + floor((n-1)/k) + 4`. All other variables remain unchanged.
