To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will continue as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than the length of `permutation`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even (e.g., `k` is 2).
- `permutation` is a list of length `n` with the first element set to 1, the second element set to 0, and the third element set to 2.
- `idx` is 0.
- `idx_v` is 1.
- `curr_v` is 3.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 4.

The length of `permutation` is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `n`.

Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is currently 4, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 4. The other variables (`idx`, `idx_v`, `curr_v`) are not part of the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state should be modified to ensure `n` is greater than 4.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even (e.g., `k` is 2); `permutation` is a list of length `n` with the first element set to 1, the second element set to 0, and the third element set to 2; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is 3; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 4; `n` must be greater than 4**.
