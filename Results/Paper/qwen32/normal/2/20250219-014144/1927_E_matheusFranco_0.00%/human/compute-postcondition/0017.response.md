Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even (e.g., `k` is 2); `permutation` is a list of length `n` with the first element set to 1, the second element set to 0, the third element set to 2, and the fourth element set to 3; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is 4; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 4; `n` must be greater than 4.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `curr_v` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. All other variables retain their initial values.
