To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop statement:

```
while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will continue as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than the length of the `permutation` list.

### Analysis of the Current State:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n`.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2 + k`.

### Condition for Loop Execution:
The loop will execute if `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`. Given that `permutation` has a length of `n`, the condition becomes `multiples_of_k_plus_i < n`.

### Current Value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i`:
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2 + k`.

### Ensuring the Loop Can Execute One More Time:
For the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` should be less than `n`. Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is currently `2 + k`, we need to ensure that `2 + k < n`.

### Adjustment:
Given that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even, the smallest possible value for `k` is 2. Therefore, the smallest possible value for `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2 + 2 = 4`. To ensure that `multiples_of_k_plus_i < n`, `n` must be greater than `4`.

### Conclusion:
To make sure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than `4`.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values 1, 2, ..., `floor(n/k)` at positions 0, `k`, `2k`, ..., `(floor(n/k) - 1) * k`, `floor(n/k) + 1` at position 1, `floor(n/k) + 2` at position `k + 1`, ..., `floor(n/k) + floor((n-1)/k)` at position `(floor((n-1)/k) - 1) * k + 1`, and 0 elsewhere except `permutation[2]` which is `floor(n/k) + floor((n-1)/k) + 1`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `floor(n/k) + floor((n-1)/k) + 2`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2 + k`; `i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 4**
