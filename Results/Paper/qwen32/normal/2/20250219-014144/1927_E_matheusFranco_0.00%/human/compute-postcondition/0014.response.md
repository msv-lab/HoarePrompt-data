The code increments the variable `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by the value of `k`. Given the initial state, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is initially 2 and `k` is 2. After the operation, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` becomes 4.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even (e.g., `k` is 2); `permutation` is a list of length `n` with the first element set to 1, the second element set to 0, and the third element set to 2; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is 3; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 4.**
