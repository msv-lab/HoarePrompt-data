To determine the output state, we need to know what `func_1()` does. Since the function definition is not provided, we cannot determine the exact changes to the variables. However, based on the given information, we can assume that `func_1()` might modify some variables or perform certain actions.

Since there's no specific information about what `func_1()` does, we can only state that `t` remains at least 1 unless `func_1()` modifies it. If `func_1()` does not modify `t`, then the output state will be the same as the initial state.

If `func_1()` does modify `t` or introduces new variables, we would need that information to provide an accurate output state. For now, assuming `func_1()` does not affect `t`:

Output State: **`t` is at least 1**.
