The given code snippet updates the value at a specific index in the `permutation` list. Here's the detailed output state:

The value at index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` (which is `2 + k`) in the `permutation` list is set to `curr_v` (which is `floor(n/k) + floor((n-1)/k) + 2`). All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values 1, 2, ..., `floor(n/k)` at positions 0, `k`, `2k`, ..., `(floor(n/k) - 1) * k`, `floor(n/k) + 1` at position 1, `floor(n/k) + 2` at position `k + 1`, ..., `floor(n/k) + floor((n-1)/k)` at position `(floor((n-1)/k) - 1) * k + 1`, and 0 elsewhere except `permutation[2]` which is `floor(n/k) + floor((n-1)/k) + 1` and `permutation[2 + k]` which is `floor(n/k) + floor((n-1)/k) + 2`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `floor(n/k) + floor((n-1)/k) + 2`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2 + k`; `i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 4.**
