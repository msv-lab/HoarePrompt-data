To determine the output state, we need to know what `func_1()` does. Since the function definition is not provided, we can only assume that `func_1()` could potentially modify the variables in the environment or perform some operations without affecting any variables.

Given the limited information, let's assume that `func_1()` does not modify any variables or return any values. Therefore, the state of the variable `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 2**.
