Let's analyze the provided code to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Analysis:

1. **Initialization of `defaultdict`:**
   - The `defaultdict` is initialized with a default value function `default_value`, but this function is not defined anywhere in the code. This will cause an error when trying to access a key that does not exist in the dictionary.
   - Instead, we can initialize the dictionary with zeros directly.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The code correctly counts the occurrences of each difficulty level in the input string `s`.

3. **Calculating the Minimum Number of Problems:**
   - The code iterates over the keys in the dictionary and checks if the count of any difficulty level is less than or equal to `m`. If it is, it adds the difference `(m - d[val])` to the answer `ans`.
   - However, this logic is flawed because it does not account for the fact that each round requires exactly one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. Therefore, for `m` rounds, Vlad needs at least `m` problems of each difficulty level.

4. **Correct Logic:**
   - For each difficulty level, Vlad needs `m` problems. The code should calculate how many additional problems are needed for each difficulty level and sum them up.
   - Specifically, for each difficulty level, if there are fewer than `m` problems, the number of additional problems needed is `m - d[val]`. If there are `m` or more problems, no additional problems are needed for that difficulty level.

### Corrected Code:
Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def main():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        d = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(n):
            d[s[i]] += 1
        ans = 0
        for val in 'ABCDEFG':
            if d[val] < m:
                ans += m - d[val]
        print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Conclusion:
The original code is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**
