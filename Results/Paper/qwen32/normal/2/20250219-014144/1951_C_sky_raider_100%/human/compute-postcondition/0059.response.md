Output State: **`t` is `s`, `c` is `c + s * l[4]`, `k` is `k - s`, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` and `k` are the integers read from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.**

Natural Language: The value of `k` has been decreased by `s`. All other variables retain their original values as described in the initial state.
