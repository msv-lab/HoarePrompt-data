### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the list of ticket prices and then purchasing tickets in increasing order of price. However, this approach does not correctly account for the constraint that purchasing tickets on a given day increases the price of tickets on subsequent days.

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Sorting the Prices**: Sorting the prices and purchasing tickets in increasing order does not consider the effect of increasing prices on subsequent days. If you buy tickets on a cheaper day, it will increase the price of tickets on all future days, which might make it more expensive to buy tickets later.

2. **Ignoring Price Increases**: The code simply adds the price of the tickets to the cumulative cost without considering how buying tickets on a particular day affects the prices on future days.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to use a different strategy, such as dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm that takes into account the price increases. One possible approach is to use a priority queue to always buy tickets on the day with the lowest current price, while keeping track of the price increases.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the current implementation does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
