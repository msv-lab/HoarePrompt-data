Output State: **`t` is `t + s`; `c` is `c + s * (l[i] + t)`; `k` is the initial `k` minus the total `min(m, k)` accumulated over all iterations; `i` is `n + 1`; `n` must be greater than 0; `m` and `k` are the integers read from the input; `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `s` is `min(m, k)`**

In natural language: The value of `t` has been incremented by `s`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
