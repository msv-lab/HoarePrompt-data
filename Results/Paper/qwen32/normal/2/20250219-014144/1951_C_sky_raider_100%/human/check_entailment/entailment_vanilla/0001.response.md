Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to purchase `k` tickets over `n` days.
- Each day has a price `a_i` for a ticket.
- We can buy up to `m` tickets per day.
- Buying `x` tickets on day `i` increases the price of tickets on all subsequent days by `x`.

### Objective:
Find the minimum spending to purchase exactly `k` tickets.

### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It also reads the list of prices `l`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The list of prices `l` is sorted in ascending order. This is a key step because it ensures we are always buying tickets on the cheapest available days first, which is a greedy approach to minimize cost.

3. **Buying Tickets**:
   - The program initializes `t` (total increase in price due to previous purchases), `s` (tickets bought on the current day), and `c` (total cost).
   - It iterates through each day `i`:
     - `s` is set to the minimum of `m` (maximum tickets allowed per day) and `k` (remaining tickets to be bought).
     - The cost for the tickets bought on day `i` is added to `c`. This cost is calculated as `s * (l[i] + t)`, where `l[i]` is the original price on day `i` and `t` is the accumulated price increase.
     - `t` is incremented by `s` to reflect the new price increase for subsequent days.
     - `k` is decremented by `s` to reflect the tickets bought.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all days for a test case, the total cost `c` is printed.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The sorting of prices ensures that the cheapest tickets are bought first, which aligns with the greedy strategy to minimize cost.
- The logic for calculating the cost and updating the price increase is correctly implemented.
- The loop continues until all `k` tickets are bought, and the total cost is correctly computed and printed.

Given this analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
