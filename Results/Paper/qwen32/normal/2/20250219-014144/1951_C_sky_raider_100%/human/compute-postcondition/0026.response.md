The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `l`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `c`, `k`, `i`, `n`, `m`, or any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is the sum of `min(m, k)` over all iterations; `c` is the cumulative sum of `min(m, k) * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration; `k` is the initial `k` minus the total `min(m, k)` accumulated over all iterations; `i` is `n + 1`; `n`, `m`, and `k` are the integers read from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input.**
