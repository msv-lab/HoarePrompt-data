Output State: **`t` is `s`; `n` must be greater than 0; `m`, `k` are integers read from the input; `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`; `c` is `s * l[i]`; `k` is `k - s`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `k` is decreased by the value of `s`. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions.
