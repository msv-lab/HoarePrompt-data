The code snippet provided is `t += s`. This means the current value of `t` is increased by the value of `s`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than `i`
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `s` is `min(m, k)`
- `c` is `c + s * (l[i] + t)`

After executing `t += s`, the value of `t` changes. The new value of `t` will be the old value of `t` plus `s`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i`; `i` is `i + 1`; `s` is `min(m, k)`; `c` is `c + s * (l[i] + t)`; `t` is `t + s`.**
