Given the initial state, `count` represents the number of '+' characters in the expression, and `sub` is calculated as the length of the expression minus `count`. The return statement computes the absolute difference between `sub` and `count`.

Let's denote the length of the expression as `length`. Therefore, `sub` can be expressed as `length - count`. The return statement calculates `abs(sub - count)`, which simplifies to `abs((length - count) - count)` or `abs(length - 2*count)`.

Since we do not have the exact values of `length` and `count`, we express the output in terms of these variables.

Output State: **The program returns the absolute value of (length - 2*count)**
