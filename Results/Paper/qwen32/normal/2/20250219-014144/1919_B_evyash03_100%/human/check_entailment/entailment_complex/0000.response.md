### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem statement and the provided code to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to minimize the total penalty when splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`. The penalty for each subarray `b_i` is defined as the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length. The optimal strategy involves finding a way to split the array such that the penalties are minimized.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code defines a function `func_1` which takes the expression and its length as input. Here's what the function does:
1. It counts the number of `'+'` characters in the string `expression`.
2. It calculates `sub` as `length - count`, which represents the number of `'-'` characters.
3. It returns the absolute value of the difference between `length` and `2 * count`.

The returned value `abs(sub - count)` simplifies to `abs(length - 2 * count)`, which is the absolute difference between the total length of the string and twice the number of `'+'` characters.

#### Evaluation:
The logic implemented in `func_1` does not align with the problem requirements. The function does not consider any splitting of the array; instead, it computes a fixed value based on the count of `'+'` and `'-'` characters. This value does not represent the minimum penalty achievable through optimal splitting.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to implement a dynamic programming approach or another method to explore different ways of splitting the array and compute the penalties accordingly.

#### Conclusion:
Given that the provided function does not implement the required logic to find the minimum penalty, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
