Output State: **`expression` is a string of length `length` (where 1 <= `length` <= 5000) consisting of characters '+' and '-', `count` is 1, and the current character `char` is '+'**

Explanation: The value of `count` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of `expression` and `char` remain unchanged.
