To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the `count` variable based on the characters in the `expression` string.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `expression` is a string of length `length` consisting of characters '+' and '-'.
   - `count` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop iterates over each character (`char`) in the `expression` string.
   - For each character:
     - If `char` is '+', `count` is incremented by 1.
     - If `char` is '-', `count` remains unchanged.

3. **Final Output State**:
   - After the loop has iterated through all characters in the `expression` string, `count` will hold the total number of '+' characters in the `expression`.

Thus, the final `count` value is simply the number of '+' characters in the `expression` string.

**Output State: **count is the number of '+' characters in the expression.**

In natural language: The final output state is that `count` will be equal to the total number of '+' characters present in the `expression` string.
