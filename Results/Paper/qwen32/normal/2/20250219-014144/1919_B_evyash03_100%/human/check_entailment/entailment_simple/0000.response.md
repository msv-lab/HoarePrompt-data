### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements.

The goal is to minimize the total penalty of splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The optimal strategy involves splitting the array in such a way that subarrays with a sum of zero are formed, as these contribute zero to the total penalty.

However, the provided function `func_1` does not implement this optimal strategy. Instead, it calculates the absolute difference between the number of `'+'` and `'-'` characters in the string. This calculation does not account for the actual optimal splits that would minimize the penalty.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the function is incorrect:

1. **Counting Characters**: The function counts the number of `'+'` characters (`count`) and calculates the number of `'-'` characters (`sub = length - count`).

2. **Calculating Penalty**: The function returns `abs(sub - count)`, which is equivalent to `abs(length - 2 * count)`. This value does not represent the minimum penalty because it does not consider how the string should be split to achieve the lowest possible penalty.

3. **Optimal Strategy**: To minimize the penalty, one should aim to create subarrays where the sum is zero. For example, in the third test case (`"+-+-+-"`), the optimal split is `([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1])`, resulting in a penalty of `0`. However, `func_1` would return `2`, which is incorrect.

Given the above points, the function `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum penalty as required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **False**
