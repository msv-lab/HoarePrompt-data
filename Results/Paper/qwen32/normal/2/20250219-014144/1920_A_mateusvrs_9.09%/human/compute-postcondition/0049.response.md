Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is the total number of iterations; `cx` is a set containing all unique values of `x` where `a` was 3; `ax` is the minimum value of `x` where `a` was 2; `bx` is the maximum value of `x` where `a` was 1. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` contains an additional element `0`. Otherwise, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that satisfy `bx` ≤ `i` ≤ `ax`, and `r` now includes the new element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.**
