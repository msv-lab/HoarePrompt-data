Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499; `n` is the input integer; `cx` is a set; `ax` is 1000000007; `bx` is -1; If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` contains an additional element `0`. Otherwise, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that satisfy `bx` ≤ `i` ≤ `ax`, and `r` now includes the new element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.**

Explanation: The value of `bx` has been changed to `-1`. All other variables retain their initial states and conditions.
