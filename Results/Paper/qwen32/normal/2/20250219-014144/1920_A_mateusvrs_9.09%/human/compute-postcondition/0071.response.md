Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499; `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0; `cx` is a set containing `x` if `a` is not equal to 2, otherwise `cx` remains unchanged; `ax` is min(`x`, 1000000007) if `a` equals 2, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007; `bx` is either `x` if `a` equals 1, or -1 otherwise; `a` and `x` are the integers read from the input.**
