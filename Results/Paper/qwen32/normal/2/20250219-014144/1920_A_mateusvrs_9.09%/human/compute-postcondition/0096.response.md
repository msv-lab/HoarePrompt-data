The given code snippet appends a calculated value to the list `r`. The value being appended is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499
- `n` is 0
- `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values added when `a` was 3
- `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was 2, or 1000000007 if no such `x` was encountered
- `bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was 1, or -1 if no such `x` was encountered
- `r` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions inside the loop
- `bx` is less than `ax`
- `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that satisfy `bx ≤ i ≤ ax`

After executing the line `r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)`, the list `r` will have a new element added to it, which is the result of the expression `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`, `tmp`) are modified by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499; `n` is 0; `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values added when `a` was 3; `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was 2, or 1000000007 if no such `x` was encountered; `bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was 1, or -1 if no such `x` was encountered; `r` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions inside the loop, including the newly added element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`; `bx` is less than `ax`; `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that satisfy `bx ≤ i ≤ ax`.**
