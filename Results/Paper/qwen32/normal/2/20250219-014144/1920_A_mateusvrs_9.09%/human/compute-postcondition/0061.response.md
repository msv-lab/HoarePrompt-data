The code snippet `ax = min(x, ax)` updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `x`. Given that `ax` is initially 1000000007, the new value of `ax` will be `x` if `x` is less than 1000000007; otherwise, it will remain 1000000007.

Since the value of `x` is not specified, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `ax` after the operation, but we know that `ax` will be the smaller of `x` and 1000000007.

All other variables (`t`, `n`, `cx`, `bx`, `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499; `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0; `cx` is a set; `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007; `bx` is -1; `a` is 2; `x` is the integer read from the input.**
