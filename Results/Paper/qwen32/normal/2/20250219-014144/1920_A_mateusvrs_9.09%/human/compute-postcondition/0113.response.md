Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 498; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `ax` is 1000000007; `r` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions inside the loop; `a` is the first integer from the input; `x` is the second integer from the input. If `a` equals 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` does not equal 1, then `bx` is -1. If `a` equals 2, then `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and `x`. If `a` does not equal 1 and `a` does not equal 2, then `cx` is a set containing the value `x`.**
