The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `x`. This affects the values of `a` and `x`, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`, `r`, and `tmp`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output state would be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499; `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0; `cx` is a set; `ax` is 1000000007; `bx` is -1; If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` contains an additional element `0`. Otherwise, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that satisfy `bx` ≤ `i` ≤ `ax`, and `r` now includes the new element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`; `a` and `x` are the integers read from the input.**
