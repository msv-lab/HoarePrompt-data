Let's carefully analyze the provided program and verify its correctness using the problem description and the function summary.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It initializes an empty list `r` to store the results for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - It initializes:
     - `cx` as an empty set to store values that `k` cannot be (from constraints of type 3).
     - `ax` to a very large value (`1000000000 + 7`) to represent the upper bound (from constraints of type 2).
     - `bx` to `-1` to represent the lower bound (from constraints of type 1).

3. **Reading Constraints:**
   - For each constraint, it reads the type `a` and the value `x`.
   - If `a == 1`, it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and the current `bx` (to ensure `k` is at least `x`).
   - If `a == 2`, it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and the current `ax` (to ensure `k` is at most `x`).
   - If `a == 3`, it adds `x` to the set `cx` (to ensure `k` is not equal to `x`).

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx > ax`. If true, it means there are no integers `k` that can satisfy both the lower and upper bounds simultaneously, so it appends `0` to the results list `r`.
   - If `bx <= ax`, it calculates the number of integers between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, excluding those in `cx`.

5. **Counting Valid Integers:**
   - It initializes `tmp` to `0` to count how many elements in `cx` fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.
   - It iterates over each element in `cx` and increments `tmp` if the element is within the range.
   - Finally, it calculates the number of valid integers as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` and appends this to the results list `r`.

6. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results separated by newlines.

### Issues Identified:
- **Condition Check:** The condition `if bx >= ax:` should actually be `if bx > ax:`. This is because if `bx == ax`, there is exactly one integer `k` that satisfies the constraints, which is `k = bx = ax`.
- **Logic Consistency:** The logic for counting valid integers is correct, but the condition check needs to be adjusted to handle the edge case where `bx == ax`.

### Corrected Code:
To fix the issue, we need to change the condition from `if bx >= ax:` to `if bx > ax:`.

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    r = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        cx = set()
        ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
        bx = -1
        for _ in range(n):
            (a, x) = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                bx = max(x, bx)
            elif a == 2:
                ax = min(x, ax)
            else:
                cx.add(x)
        if bx > ax:  # Corrected condition
            r.append(0)
        else:
            tmp = 0
            for i in cx:
                if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                    tmp += 1
            r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
    print(*r, sep='\n')
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly maintained that the program was correct without addressing the critical issue with the condition check. The corrected condition ensures that the program handles the edge case where `bx == ax` properly.

Final: **False**
