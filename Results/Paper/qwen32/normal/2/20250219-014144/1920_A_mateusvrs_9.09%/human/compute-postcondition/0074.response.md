The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `x`. This means that the values of `a` and `x` will be updated based on the input provided. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`) remain unchanged unless they are explicitly modified later in the code, which they are not in this snippet.

Given the initial state, the only changes are to `a` and `x`. The new values of `a` and `x` will be whatever integers are provided as input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499; `n` is the input integer minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `cx` is a set containing `x` if `a` is not equal to 2, otherwise `cx` remains unchanged; `ax` is min(`x`, 1000000007) if `a` equals 2, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007; `bx` is `x` if `a` equals 1, or -1 otherwise; `a` and `x` are the integers read from the input.**
