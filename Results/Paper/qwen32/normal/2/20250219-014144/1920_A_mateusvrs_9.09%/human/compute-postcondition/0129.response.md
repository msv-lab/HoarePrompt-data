Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 498; `n` is 0; `ax` is the minimum value of `x` when `a == 2`; `bx` is the maximum value of `x` when `a == 1`; `cx` is a set of unique `x` values when `a` is neither 1 nor 2; `r` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions inside the loop; `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`.**
