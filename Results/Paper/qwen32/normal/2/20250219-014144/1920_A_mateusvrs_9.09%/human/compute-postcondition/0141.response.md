Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the new state:

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 498
- `n` is 0
- `ax` is the minimum value of `x` when `a == 2`
- `bx` is the maximum value of `x` when `a == 1`
- `cx` is a set of unique `x` values when `a` is neither 1 nor 2 and must contain at least one element
- `r` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions inside the loop
- `bx` is less than `ax`
- `tmp` is either 1 or 2 if `i` is between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), otherwise `tmp` remains 0
- `i` is the next element in `cx` after the current `i`

Code Snippet:
```python
tmp += 1
```

Impact of the code:
- The value of `tmp` is incremented by 1.

Since `tmp` was initially either 1 or 2, after the increment:
- If `tmp` was 1, it becomes 2.
- If `tmp` was 2, it becomes 3.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 498; `n` is 0; `ax` is the minimum value of `x` when `a == 2`; `bx` is the maximum value of `x` when `a == 1`; `cx` is a set of unique `x` values when `a` is neither 1 nor 2 and must contain at least one element; `r` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions inside the loop; `bx` is less than `ax`; `tmp` is either 2 or 3; `i` is the next element in `cx` after the current `i`.**
