The code snippet `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. Given the initial state, `tmp` is initially either 1 or 2. After executing `tmp += 1`, `tmp` will be either 2 or 3 respectively.

All other variables (`t`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`, `r`, `i_next`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499, `n` is 0, `cx` is a set containing at least one element, `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was 2, or 1000000007 if no such `x` was encountered, `bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was 1, or -1 if no such `x` was encountered, `r` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions inside the loop, `bx` is less than `ax`, `i` is the next element from `cx` (denoted as `i_next`). If `i_next` is an integer such that `i_next` ≥ `bx` and `i_next` ≤ `ax`, `tmp` is 3; otherwise, `tmp` is 2.**
