Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is greater than 0; `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1, otherwise `cx` is a set containing the single element `x`; `ax` is `min(x, 1000000007)` if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007; `bx` is `max(x, -1)` if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1; `a` and `x` are the two integers read from the input.**
