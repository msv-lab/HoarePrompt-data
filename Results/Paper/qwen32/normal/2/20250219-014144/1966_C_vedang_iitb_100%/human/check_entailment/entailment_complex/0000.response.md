### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to determine the winner of the game based on the MEX (minimum excluded value) of the pile sizes. However, the logic used to determine the winner does not align with the rules of the game described in the problem statement.

Here's a breakdown of why the current approach is incorrect:

1. **Game Rules**: The game revolves around removing stones from all non-empty piles simultaneously, with the number of stones removed being equal to the size of the smallest pile. The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Winning Strategy**: The winning strategy involves understanding the parity (odd/even) of the number of piles with an odd number of stones. This is because the game can be reduced to a Nim game where each pile with an odd number of stones contributes to the overall game state.

3. **Current Logic**: The program calculates the MEX of the pile sizes and uses its parity to determine the winner. This is not the correct approach because the MEX does not capture the essential game dynamics related to the parity of odd-sized piles.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly determine the winner, we should:
- Count the number of piles with an odd number of stones.
- If the count is odd, Alice wins; if it's even, Bob wins.

### Conclusion:

Given the above reasoning, the current implementation is incorrect. The program does not follow the correct logic to determine the winner based on the game rules.

### Correctness: **False**
