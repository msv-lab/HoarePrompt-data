To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is `sz` and the list `a`.

Given the loop:
```python
for sz in a:
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
- `tc` is 2
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is the sorted list of integers from the input and must have at least one element
- `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`
- `mexsize` is 1, and if `sz` equals `mexsize`, `mexsize` is updated to 2

In the previous iteration, `sz` took the value of the first element in the list `a`. For the next iteration, `sz` should take the value of the next element in the list `a`.

Let's denote the first element of `a` as `a[0]` and the second element as `a[1]`. Since `sz` was `a[0]` in the previous iteration, in the current iteration, `sz` will be `a[1]`.

No other variables in the loop head (`a`) need to be adjusted. The list `a` remains the same, but `sz` moves to the next element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the sorted list of integers from the input and must have at least one element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` is 1, and `sz` is `a[1]`**

Note: If `a` has only one element, the loop would terminate after the first iteration, and there would be no next iteration. However, based on the problem statement, `a` must have at least one element, and since we are considering the state at the start of the next iteration, we assume `a` has at least two elements.
