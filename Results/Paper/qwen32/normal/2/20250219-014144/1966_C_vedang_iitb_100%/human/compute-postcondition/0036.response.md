The only variable in the loop head is `sz`, which iterates over the elements in the list `a`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `sz` and how it changes as the loop progresses.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `sz` was `a[1]`.
- The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `sz` needs to take on the next value in the list `a`. Since `sz` was `a[1]` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value it should take is `a[2]`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `sz` will be `a[2]`.

Other variables like `t`, `tc`, `n`, `a`, `maxsize`, and `mexsize` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must contain at least two elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `sz` is `a[2]`. If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is updated to 3. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains 1.**
