The code snippet sorts the list `a`. This means that the elements in the list `a` will be rearranged in ascending order. The values of `t`, `tc`, `n`, and `maxsize` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `tc` is not yet defined, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.**
