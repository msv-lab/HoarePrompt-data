The code snippet provided increments the value of `mexsize` by 1. No other variables are modified by this code snippet.

Given the initial state, the only change is in the value of `mexsize`. All other variables retain their original values and conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the sorted list of integers from the input and must have at least one element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `sz` is `a[1]`, `mexsize` is `mexsize + 1`.**
