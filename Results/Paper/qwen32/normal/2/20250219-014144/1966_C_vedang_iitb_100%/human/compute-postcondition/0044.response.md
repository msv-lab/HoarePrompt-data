Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, and `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`. If `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, then no change is made to `mexsize` or `maxsize`. Otherwise, `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.**
