To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. This variable represents the number of test cases, but it doesn't directly affect the current print statement.
- `tc` is set to 1, representing the current test case number.
- `n` is an input integer, representing the number of elements in the list `a`.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input.
- `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.
- `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
- `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement uses a conditional expression to determine whether to print 'Alice' or 'Bob':
```python
print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 1 else 'Bob')
```

### Determining `mexsize`:
- `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer that is not in the list `a`.
- Since `a` is sorted and contains integers, `mexsize` could be any positive integer starting from 1 up to `maxsize`, depending on which integers are missing from `a`.

### Conditional Check:
- The condition checks if `mexsize` is odd (`mexsize % 2 == 1`).
  - If true, it prints 'Alice'.
  - If false, it prints 'Bob'.

### Conclusion:
The output depends on whether the smallest positive integer not present in the sorted list `a` is odd or even. Since we don't have the specific values of `a`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `mexsize`. However, we can describe the output based on the condition:

- If `mexsize` is an odd number, the output will be 'Alice'.
- If `mexsize` is an even number, the output will be 'Bob'.

Given this, the final output can be described as follows:

Output: **Alice if mexsize is odd, otherwise Bob (where mexsize is the smallest positive integer not present in the sorted list `a`)**
