The code reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, while `tc` is not defined in the given code snippet and thus remains undefined.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4, `tc` is not yet defined, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
