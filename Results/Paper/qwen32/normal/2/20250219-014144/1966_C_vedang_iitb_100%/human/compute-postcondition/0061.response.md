To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variable `mexsize`. The loop iterates over each element `sz` in the sorted list `a`. For each element, if `sz` equals `mexsize`, `mexsize` is incremented by 1.

Initially, `mexsize` is set to 1. As the loop progresses, `mexsize` will increment each time it encounters an element in `a` that matches its current value. This means that `mexsize` will keep increasing until it finds a gap in the sequence of numbers in `a`.

After the loop finishes, `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer that is not present in the list `a`.

Let's summarize the final state:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `tc` remains 2.
- `n` remains the input integer.
- `a` remains the sorted list of integers from the input.
- `maxsize` remains the maximum value in the list `a`.
- `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the sorted list of integers from the input, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, and `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `mexsize` will be the smallest missing positive integer in the sorted list `a`. All other variables retain their initial values or properties as described.
