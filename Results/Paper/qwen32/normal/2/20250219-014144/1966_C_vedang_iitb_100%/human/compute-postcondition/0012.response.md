The code increments the value of `mexsize` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `mexsize` was either 1 or 2. After the increment, if `mexsize` was initially 1, it becomes 2, and if it was initially 2, it becomes 3. However, based on the precondition, `mexsize` can only be 1 or 2, which implies that `mexsize` cannot be 3 after the increment. Therefore, `mexsize` must have been 1 before the increment and is now 2.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `tc` is not yet defined, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`. If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is 2. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains 1, `sz` is the next element in the list `a`, `mexsize` is 2.**
