Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to the integer input by the user, while the conditions for `n` and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
