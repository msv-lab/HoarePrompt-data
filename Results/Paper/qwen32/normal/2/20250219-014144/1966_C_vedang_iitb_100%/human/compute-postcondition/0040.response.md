Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`. The current value of `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`.**
