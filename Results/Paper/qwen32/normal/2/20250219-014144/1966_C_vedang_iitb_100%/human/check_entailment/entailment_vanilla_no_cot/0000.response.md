Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules and optimal play strategy described in the problem statement. The program incorrectly uses the concept of the "mex" (minimum excluded value) from combinatorial game theory, which is not directly applicable to this specific game scenario.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to use the concept of Nim-sum (XOR-sum) from combinatorial game theory. Specifically, the game described is a variant of Nim, and the winner can be determined by calculating the XOR of all pile sizes. If the XOR-sum is zero, the position is losing for the player about to move (Alice in this case), meaning Bob will win if both play optimally. Otherwise, it is a winning position for Alice.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nim_sum = 0
        for sz in a:
            nim_sum ^= sz
        if nim_sum == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

This program calculates the XOR of all pile sizes and determines the winner based on whether the result is zero or not.
