Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine the output:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `tc` is set to 1.
- `n` is an input integer representing the number of elements in the list `a`.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input.
- `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.
- `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
- It is mentioned that the current value of `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`.

### Key Observations:
- Since `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a` and it is stated that `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, this implies that the list `a` contains all positive integers up to `maxsize` and possibly more, but it does not contain `mexsize`.
- Given that `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, `mexsize` must be at least `maxsize + 1`.

### Determining the Output:
- The print statement uses a conditional expression to decide between printing "Alice" or "Bob".
- The condition is `mexsize % 2 == 0`, which checks if `mexsize` is even.
- Since `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not in the list and it is greater than `maxsize`, it could be any integer starting from `maxsize + 1`.

### Conclusion:
- If `mexsize` is even, the output will be "Alice".
- If `mexsize` is odd, the output will be "Bob".

However, without knowing the exact value of `mexsize` (which depends on the specific list `a`), we cannot definitively say whether `mexsize` is even or odd. But based on the given conditions, we can describe the output in terms of `mexsize`.

Given the condition and the information provided, the output will be determined by the parity (evenness or oddness) of `mexsize`.

Output: **Alice if mexsize is even, Bob if mexsize is odd (where mexsize is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`)**
