The code reads a line from standard input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state only specifies that `T` must be greater than `2`, which is not affected by the code provided. Therefore, `T` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than `2`; `n` is an integer read from input; `k` is an integer read from input.**
