To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after performing `k` operations. Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array. The final result should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Key Observations

1. **Maximizing the Sum**: To maximize the sum, we should focus on adding the largest possible positive sums repeatedly. The best strategy is to identify the maximum subarray sum (using Kadane's algorithm) and use it in subsequent operations.
2. **Kadane's Algorithm**: This algorithm helps in finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray efficiently.
3. **Doubling the Maximum Subarray Sum**: Once we have the maximum subarray sum (`t`), each subsequent operation can double this sum (since we can add the entire array sum and the previously added maximum subarray sum).
4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the sum can become very large, we need to take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\) at each step to prevent overflow and ensure the result fits within standard integer limits.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the program:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `T`, and for each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the number of operations `k`, and the array elements `a`.
2. **Calculating Initial Sum**: It calculates the initial sum of the array `s`.
3. **Finding Maximum Subarray Sum**: Using a loop similar to Kadane's algorithm, it finds the maximum subarray sum `t`.
4. **Initial Answer Calculation**: The initial answer is calculated as `(s + t) % MOD`.
5. **Doubling the Maximum Subarray Sum**: For each of the remaining `k-1` operations, it doubles the maximum subarray sum `t` and adds it to the answer, taking modulo `MOD` at each step.
6. **Printing the Result**: Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

### Correctness Verification

- **Kadane's Algorithm**: The program correctly implements Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum.
- **Doubling Strategy**: The strategy of doubling the maximum subarray sum and adding it to the total sum is correct for maximizing the array sum after `k` operations.
- **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation is applied correctly at each step to ensure the result does not overflow.

Given these points, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **True**
