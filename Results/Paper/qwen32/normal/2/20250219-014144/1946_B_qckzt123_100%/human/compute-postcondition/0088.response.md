The code snippet provided is `tmp += x`. This line increments the value of `tmp` by the value of `x`. However, the variable `x` is not defined in the initial state provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact new value of `tmp` without knowing what `x` is. Given the constraints and the information provided, we can only express the new state in terms of `x`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `n` and `k` are integers read from the new input, `a` is a new list of integers read from input that must have at least 1 element, `s` is the sum of the elements in the new `a`, `t` is 0, `tmp` is `tmp + x`, `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + sum(t * 2^i % MOD for i in range(k-1))) % MOD`**.

In natural language: The value of `tmp` is now `tmp + x`, where `x` is an undefined variable. All other variables remain unchanged.
