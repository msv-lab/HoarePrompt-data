The value of `t` is doubled. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `n` and `k` are integers where `k` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `(((twice the maximum accumulated sum of any contiguous subarray within `a`) % MOD * 2) % MOD * 2) % MOD`, `tmp` is 0, `ans` is `(((s + 2*t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD`, `i` is 2`.**
