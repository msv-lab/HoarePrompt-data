The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. Since the loop runs from `0` to `k-2` (inclusive), for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it defines the upper limit of the loop.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`T` is greater than 1, `n` and `k` are integers where `k` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `(twice the maximum accumulated sum of any contiguous subarray within `a`) % MOD`, `tmp` is 0, `ans` is `((s + 2*t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `i` is 1**
