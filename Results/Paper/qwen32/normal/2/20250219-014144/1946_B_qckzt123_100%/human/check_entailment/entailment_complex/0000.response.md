### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program to see if it correctly computes the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

1. **Sum Calculation (`s`)**:
   - The program calculates the sum of the array `a` and stores it in `s`. This represents the initial sum of the array before any operations.

2. **Maximum Subarray Sum (`t`)**:
   - The program uses Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within `a`. This is stored in `t`.
   - Kadane's algorithm works by iterating through the array and maintaining a running sum (`tmp`). If the running sum becomes negative, it resets to zero. The maximum value encountered during this process is the maximum subarray sum.

3. **Initial Answer Calculation (`ans`)**:
   - The initial answer is calculated as `(s + t) % MOD`. This accounts for the initial sum of the array plus the maximum subarray sum, both taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Doubling the Maximum Subarray Sum (`t`)**:
   - For each of the remaining `k-1` operations, the program doubles the maximum subarray sum `t` and adds it to `ans`, taking modulo \(10^9 + 7\) at each step.
   - Doubling `t` simulates the effect of repeatedly inserting the maximum subarray sum into the array. Since the maximum subarray sum is non-negative, doubling it and adding it to the current sum will maximize the total sum.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the maximum subarray sum `t` is zero (which happens when all elements in `a` are non-positive), the program correctly handles this by simply returning the initial sum `s` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - The program also handles large sums and values of `k` efficiently by using modulo operations at each step to prevent overflow.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It efficiently computes the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, taking into account the constraints and edge cases specified.

### Correctness: **True**
