To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the variables evolve with each iteration. The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `a`, updating `tmp` and `t` based on the conditions specified.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's effect:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `tmp` starts at 0.
   - `t` starts at 0.

2. **Loop Iteration**:
   - For each element `x` in `a`:
     - `tmp` is incremented by `x`.
     - If `tmp` becomes negative, it is reset to 0.
     - `t` is updated to the maximum value between `tmp` and `t`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After all iterations, `tmp` will hold the cumulative sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative sums.
   - `t` will hold the maximum value of `tmp` encountered during any point in the loop, which represents the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within `a`.

Given these points, the final output state after all iterations of the loop can be described as follows:

- `T` remains greater than 2 (as per the precondition).
- `n` remains the integer read from input.
- `k` remains the integer read from input.
- `a` remains the list of integers read from input.
- `s` remains the sum of the elements in `a`.
- `t` will be the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within `a`.
- `tmp` will be the cumulative sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative sums.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **T is greater than 2; n is an integer read from input; k is an integer read from input; a is a list of integers read from input; s is the sum of the elements in a; t is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within a; tmp is the cumulative sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative sums.**

In simpler terms, `t` will hold the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in `a`, and `tmp` will reflect the sum of the last such subarray encountered during the loop.
