The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(k - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it determines the number of iterations.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is `(t % MOD)`, `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` up to the last element or 0 if it was reset, `T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input where `k` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `s` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD`, `i` is 1**
