To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop:

1. The loop continues as long as the substring `'map'` is found in the string `s`.
2. Each iteration removes the first occurrence of `'map'` from `s` and increments the counter `ans` by 1.
3. Once there are no more occurrences of `'map'` in `s`, the loop terminates.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue until all instances of `'map'` are removed from `s`.

**Final Output State:**
- `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `n` will be reduced by 2 for each occurrence of `'map'` removed from `s`. Therefore, the new length of `s` will be `n - 2 * (number of 'map' occurrences)`.
- `s` will no longer contain the substring `'map'`.
- `ans` will be equal to the total number of `'map'` substrings removed from `s`.

Thus, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is reduced by 2 for each 'map' removed, `s` no longer contains the substring 'map', `ans` is the total number of 'map' substrings removed.**

In simpler terms, the final state is that `t` stays the same, `s` has all `'map'` substrings removed, `n` is adjusted accordingly, and `ans` counts how many `'map'` substrings were removed.
