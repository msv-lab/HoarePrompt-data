The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `ans`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, `s` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and is not equal to 'mapie', `ans` is 0.**
