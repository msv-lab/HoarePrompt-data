You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    if s == 'mapie':
        return 1
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
        ans += 1
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
        ans += 1
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and returns 1 if `s` is exactly 'mapie'. Otherwise, it returns the number of 'map' and 'pie' substrings removed from `s`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to make a string `s` beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters.
- A string is considered ugly if it contains the substrings "pie" or "map".
- We need to handle multiple test cases, each with a different string `s`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases and processes each string `s` using the function `func_1`. Here's a breakdown of `func_1`:

1. **Initial Check**: It checks if the string `s` is exactly "mapie", which is not a valid case since "mapie" contains both "map" and "pie". This check seems unnecessary and incorrect.
2. **Removing "map" Substrings**: It repeatedly finds the first occurrence of "map" in `s`, removes it by concatenating the parts before and after "map", and increments the counter `ans`.
3. **Removing "pie" Substrings**: Similarly, it repeatedly finds the first occurrence of "pie" in `s`, removes it, and increments the counter `ans`.
4. **Return the Count**: Finally, it returns the count of removed substrings.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Incorrect Initial Check**: The initial check for `s == 'mapie'` is incorrect because "mapie" contains both "map" and "pie". This check should be removed.
2. **Greedy Approach**: The current approach greedily removes the first occurrence of "map" or "pie" found in the string. However, this might not always yield the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. For example, consider the string "mpaie". The greedy approach would remove "map" first, leaving "ie", but the optimal solution would be to remove "pie" directly, resulting in no deletions.
3. **Efficiency**: The repeated calls to `find` and string slicing can be inefficient, especially for large strings.

### Correctness Verification:
To verify correctness, we need to check if the program handles all edge cases correctly. Let's consider some test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**: `s = "mapie"`
   - Expected Output: 2 (remove "map" and "pie")
   - Actual Output: 1 (incorrect due to the initial check)

2. **Test Case 2**: `s = "mpaie"`
   - Expected Output: 0 (no removal needed)
   - Actual Output: 1 (incorrect due to greedy approach)

Since the program fails these test cases, it is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program incorrectly handles certain cases due to the unnecessary initial check and the greedy approach to removing substrings. These issues lead to incorrect results for some inputs.
