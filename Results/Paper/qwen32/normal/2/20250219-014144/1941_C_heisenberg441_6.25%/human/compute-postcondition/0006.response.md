Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, `s` is a string of length `n-2` (after removing 'a' and 'p' from the first 'map'), `ans` is 1**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, and `s`) remain unchanged.
