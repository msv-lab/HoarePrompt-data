The code snippet removes all occurrences of the substring 'map' from the string `s`. This operation changes the value of `s` but does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m`.

Since `m` represents the number of times 'map' appears in the original string `s`, after the replacement, `s` will no longer contain any 'map' substrings. However, the value of `m` remains unchanged because it reflects the count before the replacement.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`.**
