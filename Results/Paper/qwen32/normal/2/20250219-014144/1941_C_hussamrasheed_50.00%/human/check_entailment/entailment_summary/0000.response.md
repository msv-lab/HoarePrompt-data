### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine the minimum number of deletions required to make a string beautiful by removing occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie". Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic used in the program and whether it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Counting Substrings:**
   - The program counts the occurrences of "map" in the string `s` using `s.count('map')`.
   - It then removes all occurrences of "map" from the string `s` using `s.replace('map', '')`.
   - After removing "map", it counts the occurrences of "pie" in the modified string `s`.

2. **Summing Counts:**
   - The program sums the counts of "map" and "pie" and prints this sum as the result for each test case.

3. **Assumptions and Limitations:**
   - The program assumes that removing "map" first and then counting "pie" in the remaining string will give the correct count of deletions.
   - However, this approach does not account for overlapping substrings or the possibility of creating new "pie" substrings after removing "map".

### Issues with the Program:
- **Overlapping Substrings:** The program does not handle overlapping substrings correctly. For example, in the string "mpimap", removing "map" would leave "mi", but the program would still count "pie" in the original string incorrectly.
- **Incorrect Deletion Count:** The program simply sums the counts of "map" and "pie" without considering the actual characters that need to be removed. For instance, removing one character might break multiple substrings, and the program does not account for this efficiently.

### Example:
Consider the string "mpimap":
- The program counts "map" once and removes it, resulting in "mi".
- It then counts "pie" in "mi", which is zero.
- The program outputs 1, but the correct answer is 2 because removing the 'm' and 'p' from "mpimap" results in a beautiful string "ia".

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful due to the issues mentioned above.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
