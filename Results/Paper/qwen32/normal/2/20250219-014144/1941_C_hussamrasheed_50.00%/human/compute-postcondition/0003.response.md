The code snippet assigns the value of `input()` to the variable `s`. This means `s` will hold the string value provided by the user input. The values of `t`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string.**
