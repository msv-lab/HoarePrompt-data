Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is `t-1`, `n` is the last input integer, `s` is the last input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is 0, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the modified string `s`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations (`t` times), the variable `i` will be equal to `t-1`, reflecting that the loop has completed its final iteration. The variables `n` and `s` will hold the values from the last test case processed, where `s` will no longer contain any occurrences of the substring 'map'. The variable `m` will be 0 because the count of 'map' is done before removing it, and `p` will reflect the count of 'pie' in the modified string `s` after all 'map' occurrences have been removed.
