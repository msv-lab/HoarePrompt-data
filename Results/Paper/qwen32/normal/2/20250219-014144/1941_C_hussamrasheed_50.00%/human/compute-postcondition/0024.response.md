Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. It counts the occurrences of the substring 'map' in `s`, removes all occurrences of 'map', and then counts the occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the modified string. Finally, it prints the sum of these two counts for each test case.**
