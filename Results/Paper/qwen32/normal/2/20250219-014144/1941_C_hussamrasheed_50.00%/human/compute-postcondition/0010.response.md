The code snippet `s = input()` updates the value of `s` to whatever the new input string is. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `p`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is the new input string, `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the modified string `s`.**
