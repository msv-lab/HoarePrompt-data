The code shifts the first character of the string `s` to the end, creating a new string `s2`. Given the initial state, `s2` is now defined as the string `s` without its first character concatenated with its first character.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the string input by the user, `s2` is the string `s[1:] + s[0]`.**
