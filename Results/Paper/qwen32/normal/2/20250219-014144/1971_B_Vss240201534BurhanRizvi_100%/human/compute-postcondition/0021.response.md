The code snippet takes the string `s` and rearranges it by moving the first character to the end of the string. The new string is stored in `s2`.

Given the initial state, `s2` was initially a string containing all characters from `s` in a random order. After executing the code, `s2` is now specifically defined as the string `s` with its first character moved to the end.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the string input by the user, `s2` is the string formed by taking `s` and moving its first character to the end.**
