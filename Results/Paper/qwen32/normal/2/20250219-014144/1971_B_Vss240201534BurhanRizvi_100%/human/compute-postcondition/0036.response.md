Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is the string input by the user. If `s` consists of the same character repeated more than once, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `s2` is either the original string `s` (if `s` was already equal to `s2`) or the string `s[1:] + s[0]` (if `s` was not equal to `s2`).**
