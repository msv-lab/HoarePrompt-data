The code snippet takes the string `s` and creates a new string `s2` by randomly shuffling the characters of `s`. The length of `s2` remains the same as `s`, and it contains the same characters but in a different order.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `s` is a string input by the user with a length greater than 1, and the characters in `s` are not all identical.

After executing the code, the new variable `s2` is created with the characters of `s` shuffled. The values of `t` and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is a string input by the user with a length greater than 1 and characters not all identical, `s2` is a string containing the same characters as `s` but in a random order.**
