Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    s = input()
    if len(s) == 1:
        print('No')
    elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
        print('No')
    else:
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        if s == s2:
            s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
        print('Yes')
        print(s2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is a string input by the user. If the length of `s` is 1, `s` remains unchanged. If the length of `s` is greater than 1, `s` either remains unchanged if all characters are identical, or is transformed into either a rotation of itself (by moving the first character to the end) or a random permutation of its characters. If the transformation results in `s` being equal to its rotated version, then `s` is specifically the rotated version.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is the string input by the user. If the length of `s` is 1, no changes are made to `s`. If the length of `s` is greater than 1, and `s` consists of the same character repeated more than once, no changes are made to `s`. Otherwise, `s2` is a string where the first character of `s` is moved to the end.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is the string input by the user. If the length of `s` is 1, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `s` consists of the same character repeated more than once, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `s2` is either the original string `s` (if `s` was already equal to `s2`) or the string `s[1:] + s[0]` (if `s` was not equal to `s2`).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
