In this task, we are given an initial state where `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `s` is a string input by the user. However, the `print` statement in the provided code snippet does not utilize either of these variables. Instead, it directly prints the string `'No'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Values:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 1000.
   - `s`: A string input by the user.

2. **Examine the Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement is `print('No')`.

3. **Determine What Will Be Printed:**
   - The `print` statement explicitly outputs the string `'No'`. It does not depend on the values of `t` or `s`.

Given this analysis, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not change based on the values of `t` or `s`.

Output: **No**
