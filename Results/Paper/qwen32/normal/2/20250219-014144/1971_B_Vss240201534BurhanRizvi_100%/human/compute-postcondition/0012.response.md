Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `s` is a string input by the user with a length greater than 1 and characters not all identical.
- `s2` is either the string `s` rotated by moving its first character to the end or a string containing the same characters as `s` but in a random order.
- If `s` equals `s2`, then `s2` is specifically the string `s` rotated by moving its first character to the end.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('Yes')` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`. There are no variables or conditions in the print statement that depend on the values of `t`, `s`, or `s2`. The string `'Yes'` is explicitly provided and does not change based on any input or computation within the given context.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
