Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is the string input by the user. If `s` consists of the same character repeated more than once (`len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1`), then no changes are made to `s`. Otherwise, `s2` is a string where the first character of `s` is moved to the end.**
