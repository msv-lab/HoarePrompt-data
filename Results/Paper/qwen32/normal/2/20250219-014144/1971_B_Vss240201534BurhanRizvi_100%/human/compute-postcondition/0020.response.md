Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is the string input by the user; `s2` is a string that contains all characters from `s` in a random order.**

Explanation: The value of `t` remains unchanged. The string `s` remains the same as the input by the user. A new string `s2` is created which consists of all characters from `s` but in a random order.
