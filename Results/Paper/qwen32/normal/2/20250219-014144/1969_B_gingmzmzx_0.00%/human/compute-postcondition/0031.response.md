The given code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the value at index `c` in the list `cnt`. Given the initial state, `cnt` is initialized as `[0, 0]`, which means `cnt[0]` and `cnt[1]` are both 0. The variable `c` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but based on the context, `c` is expected to be either 0 or 1 because `s` is a list of integers consisting only of 0s and 1s.

Since `c` can only be 0 or 1, the operation `cnt[c] += 1` will increment either `cnt[0]` or `cnt[1]` by 1. The other elements of `cnt` remain unchanged.

Let's consider the two cases:

1. If `c` is 0, then `cnt[0]` will be incremented by 1, making `cnt` equal to `[1, 0]`.
2. If `c` is 1, then `cnt[1]` will be incremented by 1, making `cnt` equal to `[0, 1]`.

Given that `c` is not specified, we can't determine the exact new value of `cnt`, but we know it will be either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]`.

The other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a new list of integers (0s and 1s) from the input and must have at least one element, `n` is greater than 1, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the current list `s`, `cnt` is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]`, and `ans` is 0**.
