### Reasoning:

The given problem requires determining the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is defined as the length of the substring being shifted.

The provided program iterates through each test case, converts the binary string into a list of integers, and calculates the minimum cost using a specific approach. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic used in the program:

1. **Counting Zeros**: The program counts the total number of zeros (`zeroes`) in the string.
2. **Tracking Counts**: It maintains a count of zeros and ones encountered so far (`cnt`).
3. **Calculating Cost**: For each character in the string:
   - If the character is '0', it checks if there have been any '1's encountered before it (`cnt[1]`). If yes, it adds 1 to the cost (`ans`), indicating that this '0' needs to be moved past at least one '1'.
   - If the character is '1', it adds the number of remaining zeros (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to the cost. This accounts for the fact that this '1' needs to be moved past all the remaining zeros to the right of it.

This approach effectively calculates the minimum cost by considering the relative positions of '0's and '1's in the string and the necessary shifts required to sort them.

The execution summary indicates that the program reads the input correctly, processes each test case, and outputs the calculated cost. Given the problem constraints and the logic used, the program appears to correctly compute the minimum cost for sorting each binary string.

### Correctness: **True**
