Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a new list of integers (0s and 1s) from the input and must have at least one element, `n` is greater than 1, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the current list `s`, `cnt` is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is 1 if `cnt` is `[1, 0]` otherwise `ans` is 0. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is `ans + zeroes - cnt[0]`.**
