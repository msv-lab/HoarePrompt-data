The code snippet converts the binary string `s` into a list of integers. Each character in the string `s` is mapped to its integer equivalent (either 0 or 1).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers (0s and 1s) corresponding to the binary string input, and `n` must be greater than 0.**
