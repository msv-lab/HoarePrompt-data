The given code snippet increments `ans` by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0. Given the initial state, `cnt` can either be `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]`. 

- If `cnt` is `[1, 0]`, then `cnt[1]` is 0, and `ans` remains unchanged.
- If `cnt` is `[0, 1]`, then `cnt[1]` is 1, and `ans` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, `ans` will be 1 if `cnt` was `[0, 1]` and 0 if `cnt` was `[1, 0]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers (0s and 1s) with at least one element, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in `s`, `cnt` is either [1, 0] or [0, 1], `ans` is 1 if `cnt` was [0, 1] else 0, and `c` is 0.**
