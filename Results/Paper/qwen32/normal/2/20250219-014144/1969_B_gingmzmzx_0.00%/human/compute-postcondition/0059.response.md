Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers (0s and 1s) with at least one element, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in `s`, `cnt` is either [1, 0] or [0, 1], `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`, and `c` is not equal to 0.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` has been updated to be the difference between the count of 0s in the list `s` (`zeroes`) and the first element of the list `cnt` (`cnt[0]`). All other variables remain unchanged.
