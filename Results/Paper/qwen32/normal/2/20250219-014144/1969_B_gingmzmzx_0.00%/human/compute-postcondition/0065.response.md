Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers (0s and 1s) with at least one element, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in `s`, `cnt` is either `[1+1, 0]` if `c` is 0, or `[1, 0+1]` if `c` is 1, `c` is the next element in the list `s` after the current `c`. If `c` is 1, `ans` is incremented by 1. If `c` is 0, `ans` is updated to its current value plus `zeroes - 1`.**
