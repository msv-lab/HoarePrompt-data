The given code snippet initializes a list `cnt` with two elements, both set to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `s`, `n`, or `zeroes`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the new list `cnt`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers (0s and 1s) corresponding to the binary string input, `n` must be greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is [0, 0]**.
