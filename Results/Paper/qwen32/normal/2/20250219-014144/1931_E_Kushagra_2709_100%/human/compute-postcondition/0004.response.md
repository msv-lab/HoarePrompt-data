Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer such that `1 <= int(num) <= 10^9`, `tot` is 0, and the character at index `i` in `num` is not '0', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of `num` and `tot` remain unchanged. The character at index `i` in `num` is still not '0'. The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
