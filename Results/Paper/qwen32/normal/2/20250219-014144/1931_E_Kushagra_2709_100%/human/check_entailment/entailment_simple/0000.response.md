### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in the functions `func_1` and `zerocnts` correctly determines the winner of the game based on the given rules.

#### Game Analysis:
1. **Anna's Move**: She reverses the digits of an element in the list. This operation can potentially increase or decrease the number of digits in the number, depending on the presence of leading zeros after reversal.
2. **Sasha's Move**: He concatenates two numbers from the list, reducing the total number of elements by one. This operation increases the length of the resulting number by the sum of the lengths of the two concatenated numbers minus one (due to the removal of the decimal point).

The key observation here is that the game ends when only one number remains in the list. Sasha wins if this number is at least \(10^m\). Otherwise, Anna wins.

#### Program Analysis:
- **`zerocnts(num)` Function**: This function counts the number of trailing zeros in the decimal representation of a number. This is used to adjust the total number of digits in the list after Anna's moves.
- **`func_1(n, m, nums)` Function**:
  - It calculates the total number of digits in all numbers in the list.
  - It sorts the counts of trailing zeros in descending order.
  - It subtracts the counts of trailing zeros at even indices from the total number of digits. This step seems to account for the fact that Anna can potentially reduce the number of digits by reversing numbers with trailing zeros.
  - Finally, it checks if the adjusted total number of digits is at least \(m + 1\). If so, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

#### Correctness Check:
The provided logic appears to be based on the idea that Anna can reduce the number of digits by reversing numbers with trailing zeros, and Sasha needs to ensure that the final number has enough digits to meet the threshold \(10^m\).

However, the provided code does not fully capture the complexity of the game. Specifically:
- The code does not account for the strategic choices Anna and Sasha make in choosing which numbers to reverse and concatenate, respectively.
- The logic of subtracting trailing zeros at even indices is not clearly justified by the problem statement. It seems to assume a specific pattern of play that may not hold in all cases.

Given the complexity of the game and the need for optimal play strategies, the provided code might not cover all edge cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program cannot be confirmed solely based on the provided logic.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not seem to correctly implement the optimal strategies for both players, and thus the logic might not be sufficient to determine the winner in all scenarios.

**Correctness: False**
