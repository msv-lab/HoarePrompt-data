### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several critical issues with the provided solution. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step to ensure we fully understand why the solution is incorrect:

1. **Trailing Zeros Misinterpretation**:
   - The function `zerocnts(num)` correctly counts the trailing zeros in a number. However, the main logic in `func_1` incorrectly assumes that removing trailing zeros from every other number (starting from the first) is an optimal strategy for Sasha.
   - Reversing a number can indeed remove trailing zeros, but the primary effect of Anna's move is to reverse the digits, which may not always remove trailing zeros. For example, reversing 100 results in 1, but reversing 1000 results in 1. However, reversing 1001 results in 1001, which has no trailing zeros removed.

2. **Concatenation Strategy**:
   - Sasha's strategy involves concatenating two numbers in any order. The provided solution does not account for the optimal way Sasha can concatenate numbers to maximize the final number's length.
   - The optimal strategy for Sasha would involve concatenating the largest possible numbers to reach the required length \(10^m\). The current solution does not simulate or consider this strategy.

3. **Optimal Play**:
   - The solution assumes that removing trailing zeros from every other number (starting from the first) is optimal for Sasha. This assumption may not hold true in all scenarios.
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will make moves that maximize their chances of winning. The provided solution does not simulate or account for the optimal moves of both players.

4. **Total Length Calculation**:
   - The total length calculation is based on the initial lengths of the numbers minus the trailing zeros of every other number. This approach does not consider the impact of concatenation on the final number's length.
   - The final length of the number after all moves depends on how Sasha concatenates the numbers, which is not considered in the provided solution.

### Conclusion:
Given the above points, the provided solution does not correctly implement the optimal strategies for both players. It simplifies the problem by focusing solely on the removal of trailing zeros, which is not sufficient to determine the winner accurately.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Final: False**
