Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the game rules described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code does not account for the optimal moves that both players can make during the game. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the code is incorrect:

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Reversing Digits**:
   - The `zerocnts` function counts trailing zeros but does not reverse the digits of the number. The problem requires reversing the digits of the number chosen by Anna, removing any leading zeros, and then using the resulting number.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Total Length**:
   - The `func_1` function calculates the total length of the numbers after removing trailing zeros, but it does not simulate the actual game where Anna reverses digits and Sasha concatenates numbers. This approach does not consider the strategic choices made by both players.

3. **No Simulation of Game Moves**:
   - The code does not simulate the game moves as described. It does not alternate between Anna and Sasha making their respective moves and updating the list accordingly. Instead, it makes assumptions about the game state without simulating the actual gameplay.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider a simple counterexample to demonstrate why the code is incorrect:

#### Input:
```
1
3 5
9 56 1
```

#### Expected Output:
```
Anna
```

#### Explanation:
- Anna can reverse the digit of `1` to `1`, `56` to `65`, or `9` to `9`.
- Sasha can then concatenate `65` and `9` to get `659` or `965`, both of which are greater than `10^5 = 100000`. However, if Anna reverses `56` to `65` and `9` to `9`, Sasha can concatenate `65` and `1` to get `651`, which is less than `10^5`.
- Therefore, Anna can force a win by choosing her moves optimally.

#### Actual Output of Provided Code:
The provided code will likely output `Sasha` for this input because it does not correctly simulate the game and instead makes incorrect assumptions about the final concatenated number.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly simulate the game and does not account for the optimal moves that both players can make. Therefore, it is incorrect for the given problem description.
