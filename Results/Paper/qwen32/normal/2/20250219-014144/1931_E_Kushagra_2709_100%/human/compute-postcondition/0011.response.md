The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop iterates from `len(num) - 1` down to `0`. Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration is `i = len(num) - 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `len(num) - 2`.
2. The loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration.
3. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be `len(num) - 3`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer such that `1 <= int(num) <= 10^9`, `tot` is 2, and `i` is `len(num) - 3`**.
