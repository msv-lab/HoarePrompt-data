Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer such that `1 <= int(num) <= 10^9`, `tot` is 1, `i` is `len(num) - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `num`, `tot`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only impact of the `break` statement is that the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
