To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the given loop:

The loop iterates over the string `num` from the last character to the first, decrementing the index `i` with each iteration. The variable `tot` is incremented by 1 for each trailing zero found in `num`. The loop breaks as soon as a non-zero character is encountered.

Given the initial state:
- `num` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and \(10^9\).
- `tot` is initialized to 0.

The loop will continue until it encounters a non-zero character or has checked all characters in `num`.

### Final Output State Analysis:
1. **If there are no trailing zeros in `num`:**
   - The loop will terminate after checking the first non-zero character.
   - `tot` will remain 0.

2. **If there are trailing zeros in `num`:**
   - The loop will increment `tot` for each trailing zero.
   - The loop will terminate when a non-zero character is encountered.

### Conclusion:
The final value of `tot` will be the count of trailing zeros in `num`. The variable `i` will be the index of the first non-zero character from the end of the string `num`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`num` remains the same, `tot` is the count of trailing zeros in `num`.**

In natural language: The final state after the loop completes is that `num` remains unchanged, and `tot` is equal to the number of trailing zeros in the original string `num`.
