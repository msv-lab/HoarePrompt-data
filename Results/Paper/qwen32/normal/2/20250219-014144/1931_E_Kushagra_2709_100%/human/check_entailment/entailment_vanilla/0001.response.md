Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Game Rules**:
   - Anna reverses the digits of a chosen number, removing leading zeros.
   - Sasha concatenates two numbers in any order and replaces them with the concatenated result.
   - The game ends when only one number remains.
   - Sasha wins if the final number is at least \(10^m\).

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine the winner if both players play optimally.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution consists of two functions:
- `func_1(n, m, nums)`: This function determines the winner based on the input parameters.
- `zerocnts(num)`: This helper function counts the trailing zeros in a number.

#### Function `zerocnts(num)`:
- Converts the number to a string.
- Iterates from the end of the string to count trailing zeros.
- Returns the count of trailing zeros.

#### Function `func_1(n, m, nums)`:
- Computes the total length of all numbers in the list after converting them to strings.
- Sorts the numbers based on the count of trailing zeros in descending order.
- Iteratively subtracts the count of trailing zeros from every other number starting from the first (i.e., indices 0, 2, 4, ...).
- Checks if the remaining total length is at least \(m + 1\). If true, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

### Evaluation:
1. **Trailing Zeros**:
   - The logic considers the removal of trailing zeros during Anna's turn. However, reversing the digits of a number might not necessarily remove trailing zeros (e.g., reversing 100 results in 1, but reversing 1000 results in 1).

2. **Concatenation Strategy**:
   - Sasha's strategy involves concatenating numbers. The provided solution does not account for the optimal way Sasha can concatenate numbers to maximize the final number's length.

3. **Optimal Play**:
   - The solution assumes that removing trailing zeros from every other number (starting from the first) is optimal for Sasha. This assumption may not hold true in all scenarios.

4. **Total Length Calculation**:
   - The total length calculation is based on the initial lengths of the numbers minus the trailing zeros of every other number. This approach does not consider the impact of concatenation on the final number's length.

### Conclusion:
Given the above points, the provided solution does not correctly implement the optimal strategies for both players. It simplifies the problem by focusing solely on the removal of trailing zeros, which is not sufficient to determine the winner accurately.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
