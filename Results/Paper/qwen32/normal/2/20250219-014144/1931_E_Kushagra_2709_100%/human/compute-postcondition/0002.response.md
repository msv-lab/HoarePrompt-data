To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop iterates over the indices of the string `num` in reverse order. The `range` function is defined as `range(start, stop, step)`, where:
- `start` is `len(num) - 1` (the last index of the string `num`)
- `stop` is `-1` (the loop stops when `i` reaches `-1`, but does not include `-1`)
- `step` is `-1` (decrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration)

For the loop to execute, the `start` value (`len(num) - 1`) must be greater than or equal to `0`. This means `num` must have at least one character.

Given the initial state:
- `num` is a string representation of an integer such that `1 <= int(num) <= 10^9`
- `tot` is 0

Since `num` is guaranteed to be a non-empty string (as it represents an integer within the specified range), no adjustment is needed for `num`. However, we should explicitly state that `num` must have at least one character for clarity.

The variable `i` is initialized to `len(num) - 1` at the start of the loop, and `tot` is not directly involved in the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts, ensuring the loop can execute, is:

State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer such that `1 <= int(num) <= 10^9` and `num` has at least one character, `tot` is 0, `i` is `len(num) - 1`** 

However, since `i` is set at the start of the loop and `num` having at least one character is already ensured by the problem constraints, we can simplify this to:

State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer such that `1 <= int(num) <= 10^9`, `tot` is 0**
