To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables and how many times it will run. The loop runs `t` times, and during each iteration, it processes a new integer `n` and a new string `s`. The variable `cnt1` counts the occurrences of '1' in the string `s`, and based on the value of `cnt1` and the presence of the substring '11', it prints either 'YES' or 'NO'.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer the following:

- `start` and `end` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
- `t` is the number of iterations the loop will perform, and it decreases by 1 with each iteration.
- `n` and `s` change with each iteration based on the input provided.
- `cnt1` is recalculated for each new string `s`.

After `t` iterations, `t` will be 0, and the loop will terminate. The values of `start` and `end` will still satisfy `start` <= `end`, and no further changes will occur to these variables.

### Final Output State:
- `start` and `end` remain the same as in the initial state.
- `t` will be 0 because the loop has executed `t` times.
- `n` and `s` will be the values from the last iteration, but they are not relevant to the final output state since the loop has terminated.
- `cnt1` will be the count of '1's in the string `s` from the last iteration, but again, it is not relevant to the final output state since the loop has terminated.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is 0.**
