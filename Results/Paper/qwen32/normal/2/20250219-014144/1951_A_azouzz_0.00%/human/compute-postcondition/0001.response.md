In this task, the for loop iterates `t` times. The loop head contains only the variable `_` and the integer `t`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used when the loop variable is not needed inside the loop body. Therefore, the only variable we can adjust to ensure the loop executes is `t`.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0. The variables `start` and `end` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to affect the execution of the loop.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` must be greater than 0**
