The `print` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Here's the breakdown:
- The initial state provides details about several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `cnt1`), but these do not influence the execution of the `print('NO')` statement.
- The `print` statement outputs the string `'NO'` directly.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **NO**
