In this case, the `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. None of the variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, or `cnt1` are used within the `print` statement itself. Therefore, their specific values do not affect the output of this particular print statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
2. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.
3. No variables or expressions are evaluated or included in the string `'YES'`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement will be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
