Reasoning:  
The provided problem description and the execution summary describe a completely different program than the one that is given. The problem description talks about a function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` which scans directories, checks their names, and generates specific files based on the presence of `.html` files within those directories. On the other hand, the given program defines a function `func_1` that reads input values, processes them according to certain rules, and prints 'YES' or 'NO'. This does not match the problem description at all.

Therefore, the given program is not correct according to the provided problem description.

Correctness: **False**
