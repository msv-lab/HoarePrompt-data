The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'NO'` to the console. The initial state provides information about several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `cnt1`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Based on the provided information and the code snippet, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
