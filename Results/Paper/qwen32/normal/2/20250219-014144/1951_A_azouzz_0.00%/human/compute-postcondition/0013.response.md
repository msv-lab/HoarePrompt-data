Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the string input by the user; `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. Additionally, either `cnt1` is less than or equal to 2, or `cnt1` is even, or `cnt1` is exactly 1; the substring '11' is not in `s`.**
