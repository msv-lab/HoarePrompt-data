The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, so `i` needs to be adjusted to reflect this increment. The value of `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise, but it must still be greater than the new value of `i` for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value, and `n` must be greater than this new value of `i`.

State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**
