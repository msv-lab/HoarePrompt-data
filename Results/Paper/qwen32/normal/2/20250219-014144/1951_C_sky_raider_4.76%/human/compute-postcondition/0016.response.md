The value of `k` is decremented by `s`. Given that `s` is `min(m, k)`, the new value of `k` will be `k - min(m, k)`. This means `k` will either become 0 (if `k <= m`) or `k - m` (if `k > m`). The values of `n`, `i`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `k` is `k - min(m, k)`**.
