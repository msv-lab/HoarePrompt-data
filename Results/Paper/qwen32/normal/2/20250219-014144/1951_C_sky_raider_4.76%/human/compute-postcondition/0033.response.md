The given code snippet updates the variable `c` by adding the expression `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` to its current value. 

Given the initial state, `c` was already updated to `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`. The new line of code effectively doubles this addition, making the net effect `c = c + 2 * (l[i] * s - s * s / 2)`.

Let's break down the changes:
- `c` is now `c + 2 * (l[i] * s - s * s / 2)`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `s`) remain unchanged in terms of their definitions or relationships to other variables.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `m` is set according to user input, `k` is `k - 2s`, `l` is set according to user input, `c` is updated to `c + 2 * (l[i] * s - s * s / 2)`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`**.
