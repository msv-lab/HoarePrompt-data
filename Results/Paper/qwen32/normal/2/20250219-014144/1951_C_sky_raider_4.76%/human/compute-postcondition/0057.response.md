The given code snippet updates the variable `c` by adding the expression `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` to its current value. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 2 (unchanged)
- `i` is 2 (unchanged)
- `m` remains unchanged
- `k` is `k - 2 * s - s` (unchanged)
- `c` is updated to `c + l[0] * s - s * s / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2` (will be further updated)
- `l` remains unchanged
- `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k - 2 * s` (unchanged)

After executing the code snippet `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, the value of `c` will be updated again.

The new value of `c` will be:
\[ c = \text{(previous value of } c\text{)} + l[i] * s - s * s / 2 \]
Since the previous value of `c` was already updated by `l[0] * s - s * s / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, the additional update effectively means:
\[ c = \text{(original value of } c\text{)} + 2 * (l[i] * s - s * s / 2) \]

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `m` remains unchanged; `k` is `k - 2 * s - s`; `c` is updated to its original value plus `2 * (l[i] * s - s * s / 2)`; `l` remains unchanged; `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k - 2 * s`.**
