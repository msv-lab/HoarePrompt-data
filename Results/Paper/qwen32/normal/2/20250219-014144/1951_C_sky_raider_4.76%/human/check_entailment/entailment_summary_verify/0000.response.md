Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
We need to find the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets over `n` days, given daily ticket prices and constraints on the number of tickets that can be bought per day (`m`). Each purchase on a given day increases the price of tickets on subsequent days by the number of tickets purchased.

### Provided Program Analysis
Here is the provided program for reference:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        s = 0
        c = k * k / 2
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)
            k -= s
            c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2
        print(int(c))
```

#### Issues Identified in the Provided Program
1. **Initialization of `c`**:
   - `c` is initialized to `k * k / 2`, which is not a meaningful starting point for the total cost.
   
2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost calculation `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` does not correctly reflect the problem's requirements. It does not account for the cumulative price increase due to previous purchases.

3. **Logic for Purchasing Tickets**:
   - The program correctly calculates `s` as `min(m, k)` but does not use it correctly in the cost calculation.
   - The program does not break out of the loop once `k` tickets have been purchased.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. **Sort the Prices**: This ensures we buy the cheapest tickets first.
2. **Iterate Through Prices**: Purchase up to `m` tickets each day, but only as many as needed to reach `k` tickets.
3. **Calculate the Cost**: For each day, calculate the cost as `tickets_today * (price + increase)`, where `increase` is the cumulative increase in price due to previous purchases.
4. **Break Condition**: Stop purchasing once `k` tickets have been bought.

### Corrected Program
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        prices.sort()
        
        total_cost = 0
        tickets_bought = 0
        increase = 0
        
        for price in prices:
            if tickets_bought >= k:
                break
            # Calculate how many tickets we can buy today
            tickets_today = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
            total_cost += tickets_today * (price + increase)
            tickets_bought += tickets_today
            increase += tickets_today
        
        print(total_cost)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Evaluation of the Provided Program
Given the issues identified in the provided program, it is clear that it does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The initialization and cost calculation are incorrect, and the program does not properly handle the cumulative price increase.

### Conclusion
The original assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate.

**Final: False**
