The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1` for the loop to execute again. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `m` is set according to user input, `k` is `k - 2s`, `l` is set according to user input, `c` is updated to `c + 2 * (l[i] * s - s * s / 2)`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `i` is incremented by 1** 

To put it precisely:
State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 2`, `m` is set according to user input, `k` is `k - 2s`, `l` is set according to user input, `c` is updated to `c + 2 * (l[i] * s - s * s / 2)`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `i` is `i + 1`**
