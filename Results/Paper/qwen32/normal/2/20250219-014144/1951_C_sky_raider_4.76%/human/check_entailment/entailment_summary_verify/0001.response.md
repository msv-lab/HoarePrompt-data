Let's carefully re-evaluate the provided program and the original assessment using the problem description and function summary.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to buy `k` tickets over `n` days.
- Each day, we can buy up to `m` tickets.
- Buying `x` tickets on a particular day increases the price of tickets on all subsequent days by `x`.

### Provided Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        s = 0
        c = k * k / 2
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)
            k -= s
            c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2
        print(int(c))
```

### Issues Identified in the Code:
1. **Initialization of `c`**:
   - The initial value of `c` is set to `k * k / 2`, which is incorrect. The cost should start at 0.
   
2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The term `-s * s / 2` in the cost calculation is incorrect. The cost should simply be the price of the tickets multiplied by the number of tickets bought, without any subtraction.
   
3. **Price Adjustment**:
   - The program does not adjust the prices for subsequent days after buying tickets, which is a crucial part of the problem.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
1. Sort the list of prices.
2. Iterate through the sorted list, buying up to `m` tickets each day until we've bought `k` tickets.
3. Adjust the prices for subsequent days after each purchase.
4. Accumulate the total cost.

### Revised Code:
Here is a corrected version of the code:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        prices.sort()
        total_cost = 0
        increase = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if k == 0:
                break
            tickets_to_buy = min(m, k)
            total_cost += tickets_to_buy * (prices[i] + increase)
            k -= tickets_to_buy
            increase += tickets_to_buy
        
        print(total_cost)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: We initialize `total_cost` to 0 and `increase` to 0.
- **Loop Through Days**: For each day, we determine how many tickets to buy (`tickets_to_buy`), which is the minimum of `m` and `k`. We then add the cost of these tickets to `total_cost`, taking into account the current price increase. We update `k` by subtracting the number of tickets bought and increase the price for subsequent days by the number of tickets bought.
- **Termination**: The loop terminates when `k` reaches 0, meaning we have bought all required tickets.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the original code and the correct approach outlined above, the provided program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
