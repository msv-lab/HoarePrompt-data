Let's analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
- We need to buy `k` tickets over `n` days.
- Each day, we can buy up to `m` tickets.
- Buying `x` tickets on day `i` increases the price of tickets on subsequent days by `x`.
- Our goal is to minimize the total cost of buying `k` tickets.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem but has several issues:

1. **Sorting the Prices**: The code sorts the list of prices. While sorting might help in some scenarios, it doesn't account for the increasing prices due to previous purchases.
   
2. **Calculating Cost**: The code initializes `c` with `k * k / 2`, which seems arbitrary and unrelated to the problem.
   
3. **Buying Tickets**: The code iterates through the sorted list of prices and buys up to `m` tickets each day, reducing `k` accordingly. However, it doesn't adjust the prices for subsequent days based on the number of tickets bought, which is crucial for minimizing the cost.

4. **Updating Costs**: The code updates the cost using `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2`. This formula is not derived from the problem statement and doesn't correctly account for the price increase mechanism.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to use a greedy strategy combined with a priority queue (or a similar data structure) to always buy tickets on the cheapest available day, taking into account the price increases.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
import heapq

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Min-heap to store the prices
        heapq.heapify(prices)
        total_cost = 0
        
        while k > 0:
            # Get the smallest price
            price = heapq.heappop(prices)
            
            # Determine how many tickets to buy today
            to_buy = min(k, m)
            
            # Add the cost of these tickets to the total cost
            total_cost += to_buy * price
            
            # Increase the price for the remaining days
            for _ in range(to_buy):
                if prices:
                    heapq.heapreplace(prices, prices[0] + 1)
            
            # Decrease the number of tickets left to buy
            k -= to_buy
        
        print(total_cost)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It fails to account for the price increases and uses an incorrect formula for calculating the cost.

**Correctness: False**
