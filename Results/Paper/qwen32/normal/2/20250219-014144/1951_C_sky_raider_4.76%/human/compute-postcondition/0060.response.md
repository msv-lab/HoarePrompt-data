To determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the variables evolve with each iteration of the loop. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are read from the input.
   - `l` is a list of prices per ticket for each day, sorted in ascending order.
   - `s` is initialized to 0.
   - `c` is initialized to `k * k / 2`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each day `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
     - `s` is set to the minimum of `m` (maximum tickets purchasable each day) and `k` (remaining tickets to be bought).
     - `k` is reduced by `s`.
     - `c` is updated by adding `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when all days have been processed (`i` reaches `n`).

4. **Final State**:
   - `n` and `m` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
   - `k` is reduced to 0 or the smallest positive value if not all tickets could be bought within the constraints.
   - `c` accumulates the total cost of buying the tickets, considering the discounts based on the number of tickets bought each day.
   - `l` remains unchanged as it is only read and not modified.

Given the above steps, the final output state can be described as follows:

- `n` and `m` remain the same as they were initially.
- `k` will be 0 if all tickets were bought, or it will be the remaining number of tickets that couldn't be bought due to constraints.
- `c` will hold the total cost of buying the tickets.
- `l` remains sorted and unchanged.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **n, m, l unchanged; k is 0 or the remaining tickets that couldn't be bought; c is the total cost of buying the tickets.**
