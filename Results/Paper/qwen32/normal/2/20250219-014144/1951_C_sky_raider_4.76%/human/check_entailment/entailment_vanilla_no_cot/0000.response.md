Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation Logic**: The program uses a formula `k * k / 2` which is not related to the problem's requirements. It seems like an attempt to calculate something but it doesn't make sense in this context.
2. **Greedy Approach Misapplication**: The program sorts the list of prices and then tries to buy tickets in a greedy manner without considering the price increase rule properly.
3. **Price Increase Rule Ignored**: The program does not account for the fact that buying tickets on a particular day increases the prices for subsequent days.
4. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The program incorrectly calculates the cost by subtracting `s * s / 2` which is not part of the problem's logic.

To solve the problem correctly, a dynamic programming approach or a binary search combined with a greedy strategy should be used to find the minimum cost while respecting the constraints of the problem.

Here's a brief outline of a correct approach:
- Use binary search to find the minimum possible cost.
- For a given cost, check if it's possible to buy `k` tickets within that cost using a greedy approach, taking into account the price increase rule.

Since the provided code does not follow these principles, it is incorrect.
