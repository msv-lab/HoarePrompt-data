The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The precondition that the input value (number of test cases) must be greater than 0 is not directly relevant to the execution of this specific code snippet, as it pertains to a different part of the program.

After executing the code, the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` will hold the integer values read from the input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input.**
