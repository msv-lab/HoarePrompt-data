Output State: **`results` is a list with `t` elements, and each element is either `'yes'` or `'no'`.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `results` list will have gone through all `t` elements, printing each one, which is either `'yes'` or `'no'`. The state of the `results` list remains unchanged in terms of its content and structure; it simply gets fully iterated over.
