The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. No other variables are modified or used in the provided code. Therefore, the only change in the state is the creation of the `results` list.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; each test case consists of an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, followed by a string `s` of length `n` containing only the characters 'U' and 'D'; `results` is an empty list.**
