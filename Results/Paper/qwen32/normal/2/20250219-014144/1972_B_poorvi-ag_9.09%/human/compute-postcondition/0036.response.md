To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet. 

### Initial State:
- `results` is a list with at least three elements, and each element is either `'yes'` or `'no'`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is not explicitly defined in the provided initial state or in the code snippet.
- Since `i` is not defined, attempting to print `i` would result in a `NameError` because Python does not know what `i` refers to.

### Conclusion:
Given that `i` is not defined, the code will raise an error. However, since the task is to describe what will be printed based on the provided information, and there is no value assigned to `i`, we cannot provide a specific value to print.

### Output:
Since `i` is undefined, the code will not execute successfully, but if we strictly follow the task instructions to describe the output based on the given information:

Output: **i (where i is not defined and will raise a NameError)**
