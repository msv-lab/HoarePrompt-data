The code appends the string `'yes'` to the list `results`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The condition that the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D' in `arr` is still valid.

Output State: **`t` is 5, `n` is an input integer that is not divisible by 2, `arr` is the input string, and the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D' in `arr`; `results` contains `'yes'`.**
