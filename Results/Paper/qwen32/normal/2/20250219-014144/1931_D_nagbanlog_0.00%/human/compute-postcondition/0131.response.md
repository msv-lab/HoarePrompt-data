To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state:

- `t` is set to 1.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples: `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3]), (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])]`.
- `results` is a list of integers: `[0, 0]`.
- `n` is set to 4.
- `x` is set to 6.
- `y` is set to 8.
- `a` is a list of integers: `[4, 5, 6]`.
- `case` is a tuple: `(4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])`.
- `beautiful_count` is set to 0.
- `freq` is a dictionary: `{(4, 4): 1, (5, 5): 1, (0, 6): 1}`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
```

From the initial state, we know that `beautiful_count` is explicitly set to 0. Therefore, the `print` statement will substitute `beautiful_count` with its value, which is 0.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **Beautiful pairs count: 0**
