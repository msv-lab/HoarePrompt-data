The code snippet provided attempts to assign the value of `num % x` to the variable `mod_x`. However, the variable `num` is not defined in the initial state provided. Since `num` is not defined, we cannot compute `num % x`. Assuming there was a typo and `num` should be one of the variables listed (like `n` or another), we'll proceed with the assumption that `num` was meant to be `n` for the sake of this example.

Given `n` is 4 and `x` is 6, the calculation would be `4 % 6`, which equals 4.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3]), (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])], `results` is [0], `n` is 4, `x` is 6, `y` is 8, `a` is [4, 5, 6], `freq` is {}, `beautiful_count` is 0, `case` is (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6]), `mod_x` is 4**.
