Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3]), (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])]`, `results` is `[0, 0]`, `n` is 4, `x` is 6, `y` is 8, `a` is `[4, 5, 6]`, `case` is `(4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])`. If `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not in `freq`, `freq` contains the key `(0, 6)` with the value `0`. If `(mod_x, mod_y)` is already in `freq`, `freq` remains unchanged. `mod_x` is 0, `mod_y` is 6, `required_mod_x` is 0, `required_mod_y` is 6, `num` is 6.**
