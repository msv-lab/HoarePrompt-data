To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

- `num` is explicitly given as 3.
- `mod_x` is explicitly given as 3.
- `mod_y` is explicitly given as 3.
- `required_mod_x` is explicitly given as 2.
- `required_mod_y` is explicitly given as 3.

These variables have explicit values, so we can directly substitute them into the formatted string.

Here is the `print` statement again for reference:
```python
print(
    f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
)
```

Substituting the values of the variables into the string, we get:
- `Number: 3`
- `mod_x: 3`
- `mod_y: 3`
- `required_mod_x: 2`
- `required_mod_y: 3`

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **Number: 3, mod_x: 3, mod_y: 3, required_mod_x: 2, required_mod_y: 3**
