The given code snippet attempts to compute `mod_x` as the modulus of `num` divided by `x`. However, the variable `num` is not defined in the initial state. Since `num` is not provided, we cannot compute `mod_x` accurately. Assuming there was a typo and `num` should be one of the predefined variables (like `n`, `x`, `y`, etc.), let's consider `num` to be `n` for the sake of this example.

Given `n` is 3 and `x` is 5, `mod_x` would be calculated as `3 % 5`, which equals 3.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3])]`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 3, `x` is 5, `y` is 7, `a` is `[1, 2, 3]`, `freq` is `{}`, `beautiful_count` is 0, `mod_x` is 3**.
