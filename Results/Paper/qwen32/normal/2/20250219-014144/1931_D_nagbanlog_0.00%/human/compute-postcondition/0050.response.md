To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to evaluate the values of the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is explicitly stated to be 4.
- `x` is explicitly stated to be 6.
- `y` is explicitly stated to be 8.
- `a` is explicitly stated to be the list `[4, 5, 6]`.

Given these values, we can substitute them into the print statement:

```python
print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
```

Substituting the values, the print statement becomes:

```python
print(f'Processing Test Case: n = 4, x = 6, y = 8, array = [4, 5, 6]')
```

Thus, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **Processing Test Case: n = 4, x = 6, y = 8, array = [4, 5, 6]**
