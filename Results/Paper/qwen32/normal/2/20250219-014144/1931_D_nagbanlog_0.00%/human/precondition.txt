t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three integers n, x, and y where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and a list a of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the integers n, x, y followed by the list a of n integers.
