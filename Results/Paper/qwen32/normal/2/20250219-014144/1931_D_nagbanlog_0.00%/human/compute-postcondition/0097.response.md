To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the existing variables.

Given Code:
```python
mod_y = num % y
```

Variables in the Initial State:
- `t` is 1
- `test_cases` is `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3]), (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])]`
- `results` is `[0, 0]`
- `n` is 4
- `x` is 6
- `y` is 8
- `a` is `[4, 5, 6]`
- `case` is `(4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])`
- `beautiful_count` is 0
- `freq` is `{}`
- `mod_x` is 4

The variable `num` is not defined in the initial state, which means the code will raise a `NameError`. However, assuming there was a typo and `num` should be `x` (since `x` is the only number variable provided that fits the context), we will proceed with that assumption.

Thus, the code would effectively be:
```python
mod_y = x % y
```

With `x` being 6 and `y` being 8, the calculation is:
```python
mod_y = 6 % 8
```

This results in `mod_y` being 6 because 6 divided by 8 leaves a remainder of 6.

Therefore, the updated variable is `mod_y` with the value 6. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3]), (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])]`, `results` is `[0, 0]`, `n` is 4, `x` is 6, `y` is 8, `a` is `[4, 5, 6]`, `case` is `(4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])`, `beautiful_count` is 0, `freq` is `{}`, `mod_x` is 4, `mod_y` is 6`**.
