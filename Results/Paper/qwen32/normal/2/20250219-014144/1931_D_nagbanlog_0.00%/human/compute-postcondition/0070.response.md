To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the impact of the given code snippet on the initial state. The code snippet is:

```python
beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
```

Given the initial state:
- `t` is 1
- `test_cases` is `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3]), (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])]`
- `results` is `[0]`
- `n` is 4
- `x` is 6
- `y` is 8
- `a` is `[4, 5, 6]`
- `case` is `(4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])`
- `mod_x` is 4
- `mod_y` is 6
- `required_mod_x` is 2
- `required_mod_y` is 6
- `freq` is `{(4, 6): 1}`
- `beautiful_count` remains unchanged

The code snippet attempts to increment `beautiful_count` by the value stored in `freq` at the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)`. Given that `required_mod_x` is 2 and `required_mod_y` is 6, the key is `(2, 6)`.

However, the dictionary `freq` does not contain the key `(2, 6)`. Therefore, accessing `freq[2, 6]` would normally raise a `KeyError`. But since the problem specifies that `beautiful_count` remains unchanged, we can infer that the code handles this situation gracefully, perhaps using a default value of 0 when the key is not found.

Thus, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3]), (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])]`, `results` is `[0]`, `n` is 4, `x` is 6, `y` is 8, `a` is `[4, 5, 6]`, `case` is `(4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])`, `mod_x` is 4, `mod_y` is 6, `required_mod_x` is 2, `required_mod_y` is 6, `freq` is `{(4, 6): 1}`, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged**.
