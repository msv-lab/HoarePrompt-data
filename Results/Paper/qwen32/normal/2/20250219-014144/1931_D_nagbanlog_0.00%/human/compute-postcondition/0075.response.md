The only variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If there are more elements in `a`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is `[4, 5, 6]` and `num` was `4` (the first element of `a`). For the loop to execute one more time, `num` should be the next element in `a`, which is `5`.

State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3]), (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])]`, `results` is `[0]`, `n` is 4, `x` is 6, `y` is 8, `a` is `[4, 5, 6]`, `case` is `(4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])`, `mod_x` is 4, `mod_y` is 6, `required_mod_x` is 2, `required_mod_y` is 6, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged, `freq` is `{(4, 6): 2}`, `num` is 5**
