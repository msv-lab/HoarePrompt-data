The given code snippet calculates the modulus of `num` with `y` and assigns the result to `mod_y`. 

Given:
- `num` is 3
- `y` is 7

The calculation performed is `mod_y = num % y`, which translates to `mod_y = 3 % 7`.

Since 3 is less than 7, the result of `3 % 7` is 3.

Thus, `mod_y` is updated to 3.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3])]`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 3, `x` is 5, `y` is 7, `a` is `[1, 2, 3]`, `mod_x` is 3, `mod_y` is 3, `required_mod_x` is 2, `required_mod_y` is 3, `freq[(3, 5)]` is 1, `freq[(3, 3)]` is 1, `num` is 3**
