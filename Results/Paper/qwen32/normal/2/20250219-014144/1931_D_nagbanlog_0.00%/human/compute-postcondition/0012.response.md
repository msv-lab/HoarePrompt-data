Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is 1
- `test_cases` is `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3])]`
- `results` is an empty list
- `n` is 3
- `x` is 5
- `y` is 7
- `a` is `[1, 2, 3]`
- `freq` is an empty dictionary
- `beautiful_count` is 0
- `mod_x` is 3
- `mod_y` is 5
- `required_mod_x` is 2
- `required_mod_y` is 5

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(
    f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
)
```

From the initial state, we can see that the variables `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` have explicit values:
- `mod_x` is 3
- `mod_y` is 5
- `required_mod_x` is 2
- `required_mod_y` is 5

However, the variable `num` is not defined in the initial state. Since `num` is not provided, it suggests that `num` might be a placeholder or a variable that should have been defined earlier in the code but is missing in the given initial state. Without the value of `num`, we cannot determine its exact value, but we can still describe the output in terms of `num`.

### Output Description:
The print statement will output a formatted string that includes the values of `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y`. Given the values of `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y`, the output will be:

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: 3, mod_y: 5, required_mod_x: 2, required_mod_y: 5 (where num is the value of num)**
