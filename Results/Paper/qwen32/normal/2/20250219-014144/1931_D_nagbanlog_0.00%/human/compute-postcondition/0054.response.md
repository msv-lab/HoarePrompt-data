To determine the new value of `required_mod_x`, we use the given formula `(x - mod_x) % x`. Given that `x` is 6 and `mod_x` is 4, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ \text{required\_mod\_x} = (6 - 4) \% 6 = 2 \% 6 = 2 \]

Thus, `required_mod_x` is assigned the value 2.

No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3]), (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])], `results` is [0], `n` is 4, `x` is 6, `y` is 8, `a` is [4, 5, 6], `freq` is {}, `beautiful_count` is 0, `case` is (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6]), `mod_x` is 4, `mod_y` is 6, `required_mod_x` is 2**
