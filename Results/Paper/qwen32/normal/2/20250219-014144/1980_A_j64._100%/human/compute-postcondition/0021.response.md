Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the length of string `a`), `m` (an integer representing a threshold), and `a` (a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'). The function calculates the sum of `(m - count[i])` for all characters `i` in the string `a` where the count of character `i` is less than `m`.**
