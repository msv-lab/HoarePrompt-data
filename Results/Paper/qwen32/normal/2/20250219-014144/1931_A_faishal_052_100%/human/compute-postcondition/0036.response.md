The given code snippet modifies the value of `lex` by subtracting 26 from it. The initial state does not specify the exact value of `lex`, so we cannot determine its new specific value. However, we can express its new value in terms of its original value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `arr` includes `26` as its last element, `lex` is `lex - 26`.**
