The code appends the value `1` to the list `arr`. Given the initial conditions, we need to consider the different possible states of `arr` before the append operation:

1. If `lex` is less than 27, `arr` was initially `[1]`. After appending `1`, `arr` becomes `[1, 1]`.
2. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 inclusive, `arr` was initially `[26]`. After appending `1`, `arr` becomes `[26, 1]`.
3. If `lex` is 27 or greater than or equal to 52, `arr` was initially `[]`. After appending `1`, `arr` becomes `[1]`.

The values of `info`, `i`, `lex`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`arr` is `[1, 1]` if `lex` is less than 27, `arr` is `[26, 1]` if `lex` is between 28 and 51 inclusive, `arr` is `[1]` if `lex` is 27 or greater than or equal to 52; `info` includes `[26, 26, lex]` as its last element; `i` is 4; `lex` is an integer; `j` is 1**.
