### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program and compare it with the problem requirements.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`cases`) and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the encoded integer (`lex`).

2. **Generating the Word:**
   - The program attempts to generate the lexicographically smallest word by distributing the value of `lex` across three letters.
   - It initializes an empty list `arr` and tries to fill it with three numbers that sum up to `lex`.
   - The logic for filling `arr` seems flawed:
     - It checks if `lex` is less than 28 and appends 1 if true, otherwise it appends 26.
     - This logic doesn't ensure that the resulting word will be lexicographically smallest.
     - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
     - Finally, it sorts `arr` to try to get the smallest possible letters, but this approach is still flawed because the distribution of `lex` into three parts isn't optimal for lexicographical order.

3. **Constructing the Output:**
   - The program constructs the output string by converting each number in `arr` to its corresponding letter using `chr(info[i][j] + 96)`.
   - This part is correct if the numbers in `arr` were correctly distributed.

### Issues:
- The main issue is in the logic used to distribute the value of `lex` into three parts. The current approach doesn't guarantee the lexicographically smallest word.
- A better approach would be to start with the smallest possible letters ('a', 'a', 'a') and incrementally increase them while ensuring their sum equals `lex`.

### Example Fix:
Here's a corrected version of the logic to generate the lexicographically smallest word:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Start with the smallest possible letters
        a = b = c = 1
        lex -= 3  # Subtract 3 because 'a' + 'a' + 'a' = 3
        # Distribute the remaining value
        if lex > 0:
            a += min(25, lex)
            lex -= min(25, lex)
        if lex > 0:
            b += min(25, lex)
            lex -= min(25, lex)
        if lex > 0:
            c += lex
        # Convert to letters
        result = chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96)
        print(result)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the original program's logic for generating the word, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
