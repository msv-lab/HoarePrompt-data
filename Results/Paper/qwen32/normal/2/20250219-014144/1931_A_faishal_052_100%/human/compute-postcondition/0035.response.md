The code appends the value `26` to the list `arr`. This means that the list `arr` now includes `26` as its last element. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `cases`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `arr` includes `26` as its last element.**
