Postcondition: **`arr` is a list that contains two elements `[1, 26]` if `lex - 26` is less than 27, contains the integers `[26, 26]` if `lex - 26` is between 2 and 52 inclusive or between 53 and 78, and is a list containing only the integer `[26]` if `lex - 26` is greater than 78. `lex` is an integer that has been reduced by 26 if it was originally less than or equal to 78. `info` contains an empty list as its last element. `i` is `x + 1`. `cases` remains unchanged. `j` is 1.**
