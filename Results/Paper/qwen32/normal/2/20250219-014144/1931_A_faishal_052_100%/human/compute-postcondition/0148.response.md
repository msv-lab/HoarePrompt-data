To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `info` contains `cases` number of sorted arrays.
   - Each array in `info` is generated based on a corresponding `lex` value.
   - `t` and `n` remain unchanged but are not directly relevant to the current print statement.
   - `cases` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is initialized to 1.
   - `temp` is constructed as follows:
     - It starts with the character corresponding to `info[1][0] + 96`.
     - It continues with the character corresponding to `info[1][1] + 96`.
     - It ends with the character corresponding to `info[1][2] + 96`.
   - `j` is initialized to 2.

2. **Understanding the Construction of `temp`:**
   - `info[1]` refers to the second array in the `info` list (since indexing starts from 0).
   - `info[1][0]`, `info[1][1]`, and `info[1][2]` are the first three elements of this second array.
   - Adding 96 to these elements converts them into ASCII values corresponding to lowercase letters ('a' = 97, 'b' = 98, ..., 'z' = 122).

3. **Determining the Value of `temp`:**
   - Let's denote the elements of `info[1]` as `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - Therefore, `temp` is constructed as `chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96)`.
   - This means `temp` is a string composed of three characters derived from the first three elements of the second array in `info`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the specific values of `info[1][0]`, `info[1][1]`, and `info[1][2]` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact string that `temp` will represent.
   - However, we know that `temp` will be a string of three lowercase letters derived from the values in `info[1]`.

Thus, the output will be described as follows:
Output: **temp (where temp is a string of three lowercase letters derived from the first three elements of the second array in info)**
