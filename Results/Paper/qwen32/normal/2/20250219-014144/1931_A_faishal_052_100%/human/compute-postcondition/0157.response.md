To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop operates and what changes occur with each iteration. The loop iterates over a range of 3, meaning it will execute exactly 3 times. During each iteration, it appends a character to the `temp` string based on the value from `info[i][j] + 96`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's operation:

1. **First Iteration (j=0)**:
   - `temp` becomes the ASCII character corresponding to `info[2][0] + 96`.
   
2. **Second Iteration (j=1)**:
   - `temp` becomes the ASCII character corresponding to `info[2][0] + 96` concatenated with the ASCII character corresponding to `info[2][1] + 96`.
   
3. **Third Iteration (j=2)**:
   - `temp` becomes the ASCII character corresponding to `info[2][0] + 96` concatenated with the ASCII character corresponding to `info[2][1] + 96` and then concatenated with the ASCII character corresponding to `info[2][2] + 96`.

After the third iteration, the loop terminates as `j` has reached the end of its range (2).

Thus, the final `temp` string will be the concatenation of three characters derived from `info[2][0] + 96`, `info[2][1] + 96`, and `info[2][2] + 96`.

**Output State: **`info` contains `cases` number of sorted arrays, each generated based on the corresponding `lex` value; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; `cases` must be greater than 0; `i` is 2; `temp` is the ASCII character corresponding to `info[2][0] + 96` concatenated with the ASCII character corresponding to `info[2][1] + 96` and then concatenated with the ASCII character corresponding to `info[2][2] + 96`; `j` is 2.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is that `temp` will hold a string of three characters, each derived from adding 96 to the respective elements of the third array in `info`. All other variables (`info`, `t`, `n`, `cases`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
