You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
- We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to a given integer `n` (where `3 ≤ n ≤ 78`).
- Each letter is represented by its position in the alphabet (a=1, b=2, ..., z=26).
- The word should be the smallest possible in lexicographical order.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `lex` which represents the encoded value.

2. **Generating the Word:**
   - The code initializes an empty list `arr` for each test case.
   - It then enters a loop to append values to `arr` based on the value of `lex`.
     - If `lex < 28`, it appends `1` (representing 'a') to `arr` and subtracts `1` from `lex`.
     - If `lex < 52`, it appends `26` (representing 'z') to `arr` and subtracts `26` from `lex`.
     - If `lex ≤ 78`, it again appends `26` to `arr` and subtracts `26` from `lex`.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - The list `arr` is then sorted.
   - The sorted list `arr` is appended to `info`.

3. **Generating the Output:**
   - For each test case, the code converts the values in `arr` to their corresponding letters using `chr(value + 96)` and concatenates them into a string `temp`.
   - It prints the resulting string.

### Issues with the Code:
- **Logic for Generating the Word:**
  - The current logic does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word. For example, if `lex` is 24, the code might generate `[1, 1, 22]` (which corresponds to "aab") instead of `[1, 22, 1]` ("ava").
  - The sorting step after appending values to `arr` does not ensure the smallest lexicographical order because it doesn't consider the optimal distribution of values to form the smallest word.
  
- **Handling Edge Cases:**
  - The code does not handle edge cases optimally. For example, when `lex` is 3, it should return "aaa", but the current logic might not achieve this.

### Correct Approach:
- To ensure the lexicographically smallest word, we should start by assigning the smallest possible values to the first two letters and then adjust the third letter accordingly.
- This can be achieved by initializing the first two letters to 'a' (value 1) and then distributing the remaining value to the third letter.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the code, it is incorrect for generating the lexicographically smallest word for all possible inputs.

**Correctness:** **False**
