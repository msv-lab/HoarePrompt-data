The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than 3.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`info` contains `cases` number of sorted arrays, each generated based on the corresponding `lex` value; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; `cases` must be greater than 0; `i` is 2; `temp` is the ASCII character corresponding to `info[2][0] + 96` concatenated with the ASCII character corresponding to `info[2][1] + 96`; `j` is 2**
