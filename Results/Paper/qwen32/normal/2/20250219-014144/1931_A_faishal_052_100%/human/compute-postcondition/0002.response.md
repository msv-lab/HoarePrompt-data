To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `cases`. The loop will execute if `cases` is at least 1 because `range(cases)` generates numbers from 0 up to `cases - 1`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `i`:** This variable is initialized automatically by the `range` function in the loop head. We don't need to set its value before the loop starts since it will be assigned values starting from 0 in each iteration.

2. **Variable `cases`:** This variable determines how many times the loop will execute. For the loop to execute at least once, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1. Given the initial condition that `cases` is an input integer, we need to ensure that this input meets the requirement.

3. **Variables `t`, `n`, and `info`:** These variables are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, they are part of the initial state, so we should include them in the final state description.

Given these points, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure `cases` is at least 1. Since `cases` is an input integer, we can assume it is already provided, but we need to specify that it must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is an empty list**
