The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 3. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`info` contains `cases` number of sorted arrays, each generated based on the corresponding `lex` value; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; `cases` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to `chr(info[0][0] + 96)`; `j` is 1**
