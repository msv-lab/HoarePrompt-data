Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is an empty list; `lex` is an input integer; `info` contains an empty list as its last element; `i` is `x + 1`; `cases` remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex < 28:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    elif lex <= 78:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a list that contains one element `[1]` if `lex` is less than 27, contains the integer `26` if `lex` is between 2 and 52 inclusive or between 53 and 78, and is an empty list if `lex` is greater than 78. `lex` is an integer, `info` contains an empty list as its last element, `i` is `x + 1`, and `cases` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` is a list that contains two elements `[1, 1]` if `lex` was originally less than 26, `[26, 1]` if `lex` was between 1 and 51 inclusive or between 52 and 77, `[1]` if `lex` was greater than 77 but less than or equal to 78, `[1, 26]` if `lex - 26` is less than 27, `[26, 26]` if `lex - 26` is between 2 and 52 inclusive or between 53 and 78, and `[26]` if `lex - 26` is greater than 78. `lex` is an integer that has been decremented by 1 if it was originally less than 28, and reduced by 26 if it was originally less than or equal to 78. `info` contains an empty list as its last element. `i` is `x + 1`. `cases` remains unchanged. `j` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is a list with three elements where the third element is `1` if `lex` was originally less than 28, and `26` if `lex` was originally 28 or more. Specifically, `arr` is `[1, 1, 1]` if `lex` was originally less than 26, `[26, 1, 1]` if `lex` was between 1 and 51 inclusive or between 52 and 77, `[1, 1, 1]` if `lex` was greater than 77 but less than or equal to 78, `[1, 26, 1]` if `lex - 26` is less than 27, `[26, 26, 1]` if `lex - 26` is between 2 and 52 inclusive or between 53 and 78, `[26, 1, 1]` if `lex - 26` is greater than 78, `[1, 1, 26]` if `lex` was originally less than 26, `[26, 1, 26]` if `lex` was between 1 and 51 inclusive or between 52 and 77, `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex` was greater than 77 but less than or equal to 78, `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex - 26` is less than 27, `[26, 26, 26]` if `lex - 26` is between 2 and 52 inclusive or between 53 and 78, `[26, 26, 26]` if `lex - 26` is greater than 78. `lex` is an integer that has been decremented by 2 if it was originally less than 28, and reduced by 27 if it was originally less than or equal to 78, or decreased by 26 if it was originally 28 or more. `info` contains an empty list as its last element. `i` is `x + 1`. `cases` remains unchanged. `j` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
