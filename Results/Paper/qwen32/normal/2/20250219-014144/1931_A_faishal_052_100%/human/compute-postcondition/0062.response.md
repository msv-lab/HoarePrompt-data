The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` would have taken on the values 0 and 1 sequentially. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to the next value in the range, which is 0 if it hasn't started yet, or 1 if it just finished the first iteration.

Since the question specifies the state at the end of the previous iteration, we assume `j` has just finished its first iteration (value 0) and is about to start its second iteration (value 1).

State: **`arr` is a list that contains one element `[1]` if `lex` is less than 27, contains the integer `26` if `lex` is between 2 and 52 inclusive or between 53 and 78, and is an empty list if `lex` is greater than 78. `lex` is an integer, `info` contains an empty list as its last element, `i` is `x + 1`, and `cases` remains unchanged, `j` is 1**
