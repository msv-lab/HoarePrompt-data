Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for the given encoded value. Here are some issues with the program:

1. The logic for distributing the encoded value across the three letters is flawed. It does not ensure that the resulting word is the lexicographically smallest possible.
2. The program incorrectly handles the distribution of values, especially when the remaining value after assigning two letters is large.
3. The sorting step does not help in achieving the lexicographically smallest word because it sorts the values numerically rather than constructing the smallest possible combination of letters.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        n = int(input())
        # Start with the smallest possible letters 'aaa'
        a = b = c = 1
        # Distribute the remaining value after assigning 'aaa'
        remaining = n - 3
        # Assign the remaining value to the last letter first to minimize the word lexicographically
        c += min(remaining, 25)
        remaining -= min(remaining, 25)
        b += min(remaining, 25)
        remaining -= min(remaining, 25)
        a += remaining
        # Convert the numerical values to letters
        word = chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96)
        print(word)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the word is constructed in a way that it is lexicographically smallest by starting with the smallest possible letters and then distributing the remaining value optimally.
