Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1. If `lex` was initially less than 28, `info` is a list containing the single element `[1]` and `lex` is decreased by 1. If `lex` was initially 28 or more, `lex` is decreased by 26. If `lex` was initially less than 52, `info` is a list containing `[26]`. If `lex` was initially 52 or more, `info` remains an empty list. If `lex` was initially less than or equal to 78, `arr` is a list containing the integer 26. Otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged.**
