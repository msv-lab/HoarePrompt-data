Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1. If `lex` was less than 52, `info` is a list containing [26] and `lex` is `lex - 26`. If `lex` was 52 or more, `info` remains an empty list, `lex` is `lex - 26` if `lex` was less than or equal to 78, and `arr` is a list containing the integer 26 if `lex` was less than or equal to 78, otherwise `arr` remains unchanged.**
