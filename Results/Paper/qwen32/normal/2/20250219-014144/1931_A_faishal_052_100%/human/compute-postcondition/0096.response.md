Output State: **`arr` is `[26]`; `info` includes `[26, 26, lex]` as its last element; `i` is 4; `lex` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than 26.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decreased by 26, so if `lex` was originally an integer between 28 and 52, it now becomes an integer between 2 and 26. The values of `arr`, `info` (except for the last element), and `i` remain unchanged.
