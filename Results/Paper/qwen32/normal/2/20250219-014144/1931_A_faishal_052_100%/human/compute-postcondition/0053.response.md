The code appends the integer `26` to the list `arr`. The other variables (`lex`, `info`, `i`, and `cases`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list containing the integer `26`; `lex` is an input integer greater than or equal to 28 but less than 52; `info` contains an empty list as its last element; `i` is `x + 1`; `cases` remains unchanged.**
