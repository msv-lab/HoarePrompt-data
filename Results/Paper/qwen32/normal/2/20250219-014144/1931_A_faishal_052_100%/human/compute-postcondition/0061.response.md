Postcondition: **`arr` is a list that contains one element `[1]` if `lex` is less than 27, contains the integer `26` if `lex` is between 2 and 52 inclusive or between 53 and 78, and is an empty list if `lex` is greater than 78. `lex` is an integer, `info` contains an empty list as its last element, `i` is `x + 1`, and `cases` remains unchanged.**
