Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2. If `lex` was originally less than 52, `arr` contains `26` appended to it, and `lex` is decreased by 26. If `lex` was originally 52 or more but less than or equal to 78, `arr` includes `26` as its last element and `lex` is decreased by 26.**
