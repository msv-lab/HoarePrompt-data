The given code snippet initializes a variable `temp` with an empty string. This does not affect the values of `info`, `cases`, `t`, `n`, or `i`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the `temp` variable with its specified value.

Output State: **`info` contains `cases` number of sorted arrays, each generated based on the corresponding `lex` value; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; `cases` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `temp` is an empty string.**
