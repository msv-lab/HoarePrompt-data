Output State: **`arr` is either `[1, 26]` or `[26, 26]` or `[26]`; `info` includes `[26, 26, lex]` as its last element; `i` is 4; `lex` is an integer. If `lex` is less than 27, `arr` is `[1, 26]`. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 inclusive, `arr` is `[26, 26]`. If `lex` is 27 or greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is `[26]`; `j` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `arr` is updated by appending `26` to it. Depending on the initial value of `arr` (which is determined by the value of `lex`), `arr` now contains either `[1, 26]`, `[26, 26]`, or `[26]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
