In the given for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `j`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to 2 (inclusive), meaning `j` will take the values 0, 1, and 2.

Given the initial state where `j` is 2, the loop will not execute because the range starts from 0 and ends at 2, and `j` is already at the endpoint of the range. To ensure the loop executes, `j` should be set to a value less than 3, specifically 0, to start the iteration from the beginning.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`info` contains `cases` number of sorted arrays, each generated based on the corresponding `lex` value; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; `cases` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `temp` is ''; `j` is 0**
