Given the initial conditions and the code provided, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `arr` is either `[]` or `[1]` or `[26]`.
- `info` includes `[26, 26, lex]` as its last element.
- `i` is 4.
- `lex` is an integer. If `lex` is less than 27, `arr` is `[1]`. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 inclusive, `arr` is `[26]`. If `lex` is 27 or greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is `[]`.
- `j` is 1.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
arr.append(26)
```

This line of code appends the value `26` to the list `arr`.

Let's consider the different possible states of `arr` before the append operation:
1. If `arr` was `[]`, after appending `26`, `arr` becomes `[26]`.
2. If `arr` was `[1]`, after appending `26`, `arr` becomes `[1, 26]`.
3. If `arr` was `[26]`, after appending `26`, `arr` becomes `[26, 26]`.

However, based on the conditions given for `lex`:
- If `lex` is less than 27, `arr` is initially `[1]`. After appending `26`, `arr` becomes `[1, 26]`.
- If `lex` is between 28 and 51 inclusive, `arr` is initially `[26]`. After appending `26`, `arr` becomes `[26, 26]`.
- If `lex` is 27 or greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is initially `[]`. After appending `26`, `arr` becomes `[26]`.

Since the initial value of `arr` depends on the value of `lex`, and after the append operation, `arr` will be one of `[1, 26]`, `[26, 26]`, or `[26]` depending on the value of `lex`, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **`arr` is either `[1, 26]` or `[26, 26]` or `[26]`; `info` includes `[26, 26, lex]` as its last element; `i` is 4; `lex` is an integer; `j` is 1.**
