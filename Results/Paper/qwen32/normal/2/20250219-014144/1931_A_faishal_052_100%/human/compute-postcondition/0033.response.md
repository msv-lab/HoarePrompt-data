The code appends the integer `26` to the list `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, `cases`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `arr` with `26` appended to it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `arr` contains `26` appended to it.**
