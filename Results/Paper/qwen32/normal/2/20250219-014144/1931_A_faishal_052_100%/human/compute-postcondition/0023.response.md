The code appends the value `26` to the list `info`. The values of `t`, `n`, `cases`, `lex`, and `j` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list containing [26], `lex` is an input integer, `j` is 1**.
