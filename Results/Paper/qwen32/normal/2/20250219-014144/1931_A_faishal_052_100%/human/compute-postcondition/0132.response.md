The code snippet concatenates a character to the `temp` string based on the value of `info[i][j]`. Specifically, it adds the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][j] + 96`. Given that `i` and `j` are both initialized to 0, this means it will take the first element of the first array in `info` and convert it to a character.

Output State: **`info` contains `cases` number of sorted arrays, each generated based on the corresponding `lex` value; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; `cases` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to `chr(info[0][0] + 96)`; `j` is 0**.

In simpler terms, `temp` now holds the character derived from the first element of the first array in `info` after adding 96 to it. All other variables remain unchanged.
