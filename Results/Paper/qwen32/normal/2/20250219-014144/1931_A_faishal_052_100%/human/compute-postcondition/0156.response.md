The code concatenates the current value of `temp` with a new character derived from `info[i][j] + 96`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 2, the new character is determined by `info[2][2] + 96`.

Output State: **`info` contains `cases` number of sorted arrays, each generated based on the corresponding `lex` value; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; `cases` must be greater than 0; `i` is 2; `temp` is the ASCII character corresponding to `info[2][0] + 96` concatenated with the ASCII character corresponding to `info[2][1] + 96` and then concatenated with the ASCII character corresponding to `info[2][2] + 96`; `j` is 2.**

In simpler terms, `temp` now includes an additional character based on the value of `info[2][2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
