Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is `[]`; `info` includes `[26, 26, lex]` as its last element; `i` is 4; `lex` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex < 28:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    elif lex <= 78:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is either `[]` or `[1]` or `[26]`; `info` includes `[26, 26, lex]` as its last element; `i` is 4; `lex` is an integer. If `lex` is less than 27, `arr` is `[1]`. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 inclusive, `arr` is `[26]`. If `lex` is 27 or greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is `[]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` is either `[]`, `[1]`, `[26]`, `[1, 1]`, `[26, 1]`, or `[1, 26]`, `[26, 26]`; `info` includes `[26, 26, lex]` as its last element; `i` is 4; `lex` is an integer. If `lex` was less than 27, `arr` is `[1]` if `lex - 1` is less than 27, `[26, 1]` if `lex - 1` is between 28 and 51 inclusive, and `[1]` if `lex - 1` is 27 or greater than or equal to 52. If `lex` was 27, `arr` is `[1, 26]` and `lex` is now 1. If `lex` was between 28 and 51 inclusive, `arr` is `[26]` and `lex` is now between 2 and 25 inclusive. If `lex` was 52, `arr` is `[26, 26]` and `lex` is now 26. If `lex` is greater than 52 and less than or equal to 78, `arr` is `[26, 26]` and `lex` is now between 27 and 52 inclusive. If `lex` is greater than 78, the state remains unchanged from the precondition; `j` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is either `[]`, `[1]`, `[26]`, `[1, 1]`, `[26, 1]`, `[1, 26]`, or `[26, 26]`. `info` includes `[26, 26, lex]` as its last element. `i` is 4. `j` is 2. If `lex` was initially less than 28, `lex` is decreased by 1. If `lex` was initially 28 or greater but less than 52, `lex` is decreased by 26. If `lex` was initially 52 or greater but less than or equal to 78, `lex` is decreased by 26. If `lex` was initially greater than 78, `lex` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
