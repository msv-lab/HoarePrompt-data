To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider how the loop progresses and modifies its variables.

The loop iterates over the range of `cases`. For each iteration (indexed by `i`), it constructs a string `temp` by concatenating the ASCII characters corresponding to the first three elements of the `i`-th array in `info` (each element incremented by 96). After constructing `temp`, it prints the string.

After the loop completes all iterations, `i` will have taken on every value from 0 to `cases - 1`. The loop will have printed a string for each of these iterations.

Here's the final state of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- `info` remains unchanged as it was initially.
- `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they were initially.
- `cases` remains unchanged as it was initially.
- `i` will be equal to `cases` because the loop runs from `0` to `cases - 1`, and after the last iteration, `i` is incremented to `cases`.

The variable `temp` will hold the string constructed during the last iteration of the loop, which is the ASCII characters corresponding to `info[cases - 1][0] + 96`, `info[cases - 1][1] + 96`, and `info[cases - 1][2] + 96`. However, since `temp` is reinitialized to an empty string at the start of each iteration, its final value after the loop ends is not relevant to the overall state of the program unless specifically needed for further computation.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`info` contains `cases` number of sorted arrays, each generated based on the corresponding `lex` value; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; `cases` remains unchanged; `i` equals `cases`.**
