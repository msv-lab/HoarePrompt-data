Functionality: **The function reads an integer `cases` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` and generates a string of three characters based on the value of `lex`. It then prints these strings. The values of `t` and `n` mentioned in the annotations are not parameters of the function and do not affect its behavior.**
