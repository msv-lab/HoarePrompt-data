The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `cases`. If `i` is less than `cases`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `cases` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`info` contains `cases` number of sorted arrays, each generated based on the corresponding `lex` value; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; `cases` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to `chr(info[0][0] + 96)`, `chr(info[0][1] + 96)`, and `chr(info[0][2] + 96)`; `j` is 2**
