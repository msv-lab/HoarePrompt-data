In the given task, the for loop iterates over a fixed range of 3 (`range(3)`). This means the loop will execute exactly three times if the range is valid. The variables in the loop head are `j` and the range itself, which is a constant 3.

Given the state before the loop starts, the only variable that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `j`, as the range is fixed and cannot be changed. The initial value of `j` should be set such that the loop can start executing from the beginning of its range.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will iterate over `j` in the range from 0 to 2 (inclusive).
2. To ensure the loop starts executing, `j` must be initialized to 0, which is the starting point of the range.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure `j` is 0. The other variables (`info`, `cases`, `t`, `n`, `i`, and `temp`) do not affect the execution of this specific for loop and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`info` contains `cases` number of sorted arrays, each generated based on the corresponding `lex` value; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; `cases` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `temp` is an empty string; `j` is 0**
