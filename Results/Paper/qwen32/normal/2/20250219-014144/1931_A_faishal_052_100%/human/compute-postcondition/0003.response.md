Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is an empty list, `arr` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The only change is that a new variable `arr` is introduced and initialized as an empty list. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
