The code appends a new element to the list `li`. The new element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`, where `h` is given as 2. Therefore, the new element is `a + k * c + 2 * d`.

Since `li` initially contains two elements `[a + k * c + d * h, a + k * c + d]`, after appending the new element, `li` will contain three elements: `[a + k * c + 2 * d, a + k * c + d, a + k * c + 2 * d]`.

No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing three elements `[a + k * c + 2 * d, a + k * c + d, a + k * c + 2 * d]`, `h` is 2**.
