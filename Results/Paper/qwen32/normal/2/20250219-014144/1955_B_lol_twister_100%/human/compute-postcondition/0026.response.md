Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500; `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6; `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9; `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`; `li` is a list containing n^2 elements `[a + 0 * c + 0 * d, a + 0 * c + 1 * d, ..., a + 0 * c + (n-1) * d, a + 1 * c + 0 * d, a + 1 * c + 1 * d, ..., a + 1 * c + (n-1) * d, ..., a + (n-1) * c + 0 * d, a + (n-1) * c + 1 * d, ..., a + (n-1) * c + (n-1) * d]`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have completed, the list `li` will contain `n^2` elements. These elements are generated by iterating over two nested loops, where the outer loop runs from `k = 0` to `k = n-1` and the inner loop runs from `h = 0` to `h = n-1`. For each combination of `k` and `h`, the element added to `li` is calculated as `a + k * c + h * d`. This results in a complete grid of values based on the given parameters `a`, `c`, and `d`.
