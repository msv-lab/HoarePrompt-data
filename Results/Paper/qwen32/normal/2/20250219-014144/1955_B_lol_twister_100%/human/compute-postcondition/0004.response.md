To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its effect on the initial state.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500
- `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6
- `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9
- `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`
- `li` is an empty list

Code Snippet:
```python
li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
```

This line of code appends a new element to the list `li`. The new element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`.

However, the variables `k` and `h` are not defined in the initial state. For the purpose of this task, we will assume that `k` and `h` are defined elsewhere in the code and have specific values. Since their values are not provided, we'll represent the appended value in terms of `a`, `k`, `c`, `d`, and `h`.

The list `li` was initially empty, and now it contains one element: `a + k * c + d * h`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500; `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6; `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9; `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`; `li` is a list containing one element `a + k * c + d * h`.**

In simpler terms, the list `li` now contains one element which is the sum of `a`, `k` times `c`, and `d` times `h`. All other variables remain unchanged.
