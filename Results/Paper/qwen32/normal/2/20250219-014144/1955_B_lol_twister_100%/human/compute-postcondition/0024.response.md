The code appends a new element to the list `li`. The new element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`. Given the initial state, we know the values of `a`, `k`, `c`, and `h` in terms of `n`.

Since `k` is `n-1` and `h` is also `n-1`, the new element to be appended is `a + (n-1) * c + d * (n-1)`.

The list `li` initially contains `n^2 + 2` elements, and after appending the new element, it will contain `n^2 + 3` elements.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 500\), `c` and `d` are integers such that \(1 \leq c, d \leq 10^6\), `l` is a list of \(n^2\) integers where each integer \(b_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\), `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing \(n^2 + 3\) elements `[a + 0 * c, a + 0 * c + d, a + 0 * c + 2 * d, ..., a + (n-1) * c + (n-1) * d, a + (n-1) * c + d * h, a + (n-1) * c + d * h, a + (n-1) * c + d * (n-1)]`, `k` is `n-1`, `h` is `n-1`**.
