Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `row`, which is a list of integers representing the depths of the river cells in a single row, and a parameter `d`, which is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports. It calculates the depth for each cell from index `d-1` to the end of the list `row` using the formula `min(row[max(0, i - (d+1)):i]) + row[i] + 1` and returns the last calculated depth.**
