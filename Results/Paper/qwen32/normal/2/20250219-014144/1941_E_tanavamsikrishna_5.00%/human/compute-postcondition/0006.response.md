The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to the length of `costs` minus `(k - 1)`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was some value such that the loop condition `i < len(costs) - (k - 1)` was true. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and the new value of `i` must still satisfy the loop condition.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

Since the other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, `costs`, and `total_costs`) are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers read from the input; `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid, with the first and last elements of each sublist being 0; `costs` is a list of integers with at least `k` elements, where each element represents the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`; `total_costs` is a list containing one element, which is the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`; `i` is `i_prev + 1` where `i_prev` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**. 

However, since we don't know the exact value of `i_prev`, we can simply express the next state in terms of `i` being incremented by 1:

State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers read from the input; `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid, with the first and last elements of each sublist being 0; `costs` is a list of integers with at least `k` elements, where each element represents the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`; `total_costs` is a list containing one element, which is the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`; `i` is incremented by 1**. 

Given the loop structure, if `i` was `x` at the end of the last iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

So, if we assume `i` was `x` at the end of the last iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers read from the input; `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid, with the first and last elements of each sublist being 0; `costs` is a list of integers with at least `k` elements, where each element represents the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`; `total_costs` is a list containing one element, which is the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`; `i` is `x + 1`**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `x`, we can generalize it as:

State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers read from the input; `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid, with the first and last elements of each sublist being 0; `costs` is a list of integers with at least `k` elements, where each element represents the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`; `total_costs` is a list containing one element, which is the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`; `i` is incremented by 1**.

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers read from the input; `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid, with the first and last elements of each sublist being 0; `costs` is a list of integers with at least `k` elements, where each element represents the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`; `total_costs` is a list containing one element, which is the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`; `i` is incremented by 1**. 

Simplified, this means:

State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers read from the input; `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid, with the first and last elements of each sublist being 0; `costs` is a list of integers with at least `k` elements, where each element represents the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`; `total_costs` is a list containing one element, which is the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`; `i` is incremented by 1**.

For clarity, let's denote the new value of `i` explicitly:

State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers read from the input; `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid, with the first and last elements of each sublist being 0; `costs` is a list of integers with at least `k` elements, where each element represents the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`; `total_costs` is a list containing one element, which is the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`; `i` is `i + 1`**.

Thus, the final answer is:

State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers read from the input; `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid, with the first and last elements of each sublist being 0; `costs` is a list of integers with at least `k` elements, where each element represents the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`; `total_costs` is a list containing one element, which is the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`; `i` is `i + 1`**.
