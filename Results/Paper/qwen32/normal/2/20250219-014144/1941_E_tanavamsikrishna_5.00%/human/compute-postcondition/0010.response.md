To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how it modifies the `total_costs` list. The loop iterates over the `costs` list in such a way that it calculates the sum of every possible subarray of length `k` and appends these sums to `total_costs`.

The loop runs for `len(costs) - (k - 1)` iterations. This means that for each valid starting index `i` from `0` to `len(costs) - k`, it computes the sum of `costs[i:i + k]` and appends it to `total_costs`.

After all iterations, `total_costs` will contain the sum of every possible subarray of length `k` from the `costs` list.

### Output State Calculation:
- `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged as they are inputs and not modified within the loop.
- `rows` remains unchanged as it is used to compute `costs` but not modified within the loop.
- `costs` remains unchanged as it is only read within the loop.
- `total_costs` will contain `len(costs) - (k - 1)` elements, each representing the sum of a subarray of length `k` from `costs`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers read from the input; `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid, with the first and last elements of each sublist being 0; `costs` is a list of integers where each element represents the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`; `total_costs` is a list containing the sums of every possible subarray of length `k` from `costs`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `total_costs` will have all the sums of every contiguous subarray of length `k` from the `costs` list.
