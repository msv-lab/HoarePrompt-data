The code appends the sum of a slice of the `costs` list (from index `i` to `i + k`) to the `total_costs` list. Given that `total_costs` was initially empty, it will now contain one element, which is the sum of the specified slice of `costs`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers read from the input; `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid, with the first and last elements of each sublist being 0; `costs` is a list of integers with at least `k` elements, where each element represents the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`; `total_costs` is a list containing one element, which is the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`.**
