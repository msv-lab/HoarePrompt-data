The provided code snippet reads `n` lines of input, each line representing a row in the grid. Each row is converted into a list of integers and stored in the `rows` list. This means that the `rows` list will now contain `n` sublists, each corresponding to one row of the grid.

Given that `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` were already defined integers before this code was executed, they remain unchanged. The `costs` and `total_costs` lists also remain unchanged unless further modifications are made to them later in the code (which is not shown here).

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are the integers read from the input; `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid, with the first and last elements of each sublist being 0; `costs` is a list of integers where each element represents the cost of installing supports for the corresponding row in `rows`; `total_costs` is a list of integers where each element represents the total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows starting from a particular row. The `rows` list has been updated to include `n` sublists, each containing integers read from the input.**
