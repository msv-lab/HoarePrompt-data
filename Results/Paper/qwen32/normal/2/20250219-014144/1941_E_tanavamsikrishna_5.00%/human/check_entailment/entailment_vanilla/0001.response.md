Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding

The task is to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid. Each row requires supports at the first and last columns (depth 0) and possibly at other columns within a distance `d` constraint. The cost of installing a support at position `(i, j)` is `a[i][j] + 1`.

### Program Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the minimum cost to install supports for a single row.
   - It initializes the first `d-1` supports directly with their respective costs plus one.
   - For the remaining positions, it finds the minimum cost among the previous `d` positions (excluding the current one) and adds the current cell's depth plus one.
   - The final value returned is the cost of installing supports for the entire row.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Reads the input parameters (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`) and the grid of depths.
   - Computes the cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - Iterates through possible starting points for `k` consecutive rows and sums up their costs.
   - Outputs the minimum total cost among all possible `k`-consecutive row combinations.

### Correctness Evaluation

- **Cost Calculation in `func_1`:**
  - The function correctly handles the requirement that supports must be installed at the first and last columns.
  - It ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports does not exceed `d` by considering only the previous `d` positions when calculating the cost for each support.
  - The cost calculation logic seems correct as per the problem statement.

- **Total Cost Calculation in `func_2`:**
  - The program iterates through all possible starting points for `k` consecutive rows and computes the total cost for each combination.
  - It correctly identifies the minimum total cost among all possible combinations.

### Conclusion

The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the constraints and requirements as specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
