The code appends a new element to the `total_costs` list, which is the sum of a slice of the `costs` list starting from index `i` and including `k` elements. 

Given that `i` is incremented before this line, the new element in `total_costs` will be the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers read from the input; `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid, with the first and last elements of each sublist being 0; `costs` is a list of integers with at least `k` elements, where each element represents the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`; `total_costs` is a list containing two elements, the first being the sum of `costs[0:k]` and the second being the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
