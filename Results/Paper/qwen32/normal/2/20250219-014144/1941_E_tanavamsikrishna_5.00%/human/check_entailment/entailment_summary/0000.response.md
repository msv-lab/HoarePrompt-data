### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and analyze the provided functions to determine if they correctly solve the problem.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Grid Representation**: The river is represented as a grid of `n` rows and `m` columns, where each cell `(i, j)` has a depth `a_{i,j}`. The first and last columns have a depth of 0 because they represent the river banks.
2. **Bridge Construction**: Rudolf wants to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows. Each bridge requires supports at specific positions in the row.
3. **Support Installation**:
   - A support must be installed at the first and last columns of the row.
   - The distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.
   - The cost of installing a support at position `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.
4. **Objective**: Minimize the total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows.

#### Function Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: Calculate the cost of installing supports for a single row.
   - **Logic**:
     - Increment the first `d-1` elements by 1.
     - For each subsequent element, calculate the minimum cost among the previous `d` elements (excluding the current element) and add the current element's depth plus 1.
     - Return the last element's modified value.
   - **Output Hint**: This function returns the cost of installing supports for a single row.
   
   **Issue**: The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the placement of supports with the constraint that the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed `d`. The logic used in `func_1` does not ensure that supports are placed at valid positions according to the problem constraints.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: Calculate the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows.
   - **Logic**:
     - Read input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
     - Process the grid to get the cost of installing supports for each row using `func_1`.
     - Compute the total cost for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
     - Print the minimum total cost.
   - **Output Hint**: This function outputs the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.

   **Issue**: Since `func_1` does not correctly calculate the cost of installing supports for a single row, `func_2` also fails to provide the correct minimum total cost.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions do not correctly solve the problem due to the incorrect implementation of the support placement logic in `func_1`. Therefore, the overall program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
