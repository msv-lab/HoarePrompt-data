Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to build `k` bridges across consecutive rows in an `n x m` grid.
   - Each bridge spans from column 1 to column `m`.
   - Supports must be placed at column 1 and column `m`, and the distance between any two adjacent supports cannot exceed `d`.
   - The cost of placing a support at `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.
   - We need to minimize the total cost of placing supports for all `k` bridges.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the minimum cost to place supports in a single row.
   - It iterates through the row and calculates the cost based on the given constraints.
   - For the first `d-1` elements, it simply adds 1 to each element.
   - For the remaining elements, it finds the minimum cost among the previous `d` elements (excluding the current one) and adds the current element's depth plus 1.
   - Finally, it returns the cost of placing the last support in the row.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
   - It reads the grid of depths.
   - It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
   - It prints the minimum total cost among all these sets.

### Issues with the Provided Code:
- **Incorrect Cost Calculation in `func_1`:**
  - The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It doesn't correctly handle the placement of supports according to the problem's rules.
  - Specifically, it doesn't ensure that supports are placed such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
  - The function should consider all possible placements of supports within the constraints and calculate the minimum cost accordingly.

- **Simplification Assumption:**
  - The code assumes that the minimum cost for each row can be calculated independently and then summed up for `k` consecutive rows.
  - However, the problem requires considering the placement of supports across multiple rows simultaneously to ensure the constraints are met.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified with the cost calculation in `func_1` and the assumption made in `func_2`, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
