n is a positive integer representing the number of rows, m is a positive integer representing the number of columns, k is a positive integer representing the number of bridges, and d is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports. rows is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid, with the first and last elements of each sublist being 0. costs is a list of integers where each element represents the cost of installing supports for the corresponding row in rows. total_costs is a list of integers where each element represents the total cost of installing supports for k consecutive rows starting from a particular row.
