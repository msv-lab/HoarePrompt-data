The code calculates the number of coins that are facing up ("U") in the string `case[1]` and assigns this count to the variable `ups`. 

Given the initial state, `case` is a tuple where `case[0]` is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `case[1]` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". The variable `ups` is introduced and assigned the value of the sum of 1 for each character in `case[1]` that is "U".

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`case` is a tuple where `case[0]` is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `case[1]` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D"; `ups` is the count of "U" in `case[1]`.**
