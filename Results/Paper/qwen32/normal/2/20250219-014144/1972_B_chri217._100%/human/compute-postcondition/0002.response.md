Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `case`, which is a tuple. The first element of the tuple is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second element is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", representing the state of each coin ("U" for facing up and "D" for facing down). The function returns 'YES' if the count of "U" in the string is odd; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.**
