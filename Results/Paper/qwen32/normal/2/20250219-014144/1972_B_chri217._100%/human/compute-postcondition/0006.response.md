The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's continuation. The loop continues based on the value of `t`. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, and it represents the number of iterations left, we need to decrement `t` by 1 at the start of each new iteration.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:

- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.
- The variables `n`, `s`, and `cases` are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the integer read from the input, `s` is the string read from the input consisting of only "U" and "D", `cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, s)`**
