The code snippet reads a new integer from the input and assigns it to `n`. This changes the value of `n` to whatever integer is read from the input. The other variables (`t`, `s`, and `cases`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 99, `n` is the newly read integer from the input, `s` is the newly read string from the input consisting of only "U" and "D", `cases` is a list containing two tuples, the first being `(n, s)` and the second also being `(n, s)`**.
