### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and analyze the correctness of the provided solution step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective:** Determine if Alice will win the game given the initial configuration of coins.
- **Game Rules:**
  - Players take turns removing a facing-up ("U") coin and flipping the adjacent coins.
  - Special cases:
    - If there are only two coins left, removing one does not flip the other.
    - If there is only one coin left, no flips occur.
    - If there are no facing-up coins, the current player loses.
- **Winning Condition:** The player who forces the opponent into a position with no facing-up coins wins.

#### Strategy:
- The key insight is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up ("U") coins.
- If the number of "U" coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position.
- If the number of "U" coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that Alice is left with the last "U" coin and thus losing.

#### Code Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`:**
  - Reads the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, reads the number of coins (`n`) and the string representing the coins (`s`).
  - Returns a list of tuples, each containing `(n, s)` for each test case.
  - This function correctly parses the input as per the problem description.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - Takes a tuple `(n, s)` as input.
  - Counts the number of "U" coins in the string `s`.
  - Returns 'YES' if the count of "U" coins is odd, otherwise returns 'NO'.
  - This function correctly implements the strategy based on the parity of "U" coins.

#### Conclusion:
Both functions work correctly according to the problem requirements. Function `func_1` correctly reads and parses the input, while function `func_2` correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
