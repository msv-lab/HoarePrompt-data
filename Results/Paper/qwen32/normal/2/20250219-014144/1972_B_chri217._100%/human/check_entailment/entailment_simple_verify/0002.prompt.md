You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

    #State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n` is the integer read from the input during the last iteration, `s` is the string read from the input during the last iteration consisting of only "U" and "D", `cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, each tuple being `(n, s)` corresponding to the respective inputs read in each iteration.
    return cases
    #The program returns a list named `cases` which contains `t` tuples. Each tuple consists of two elements: `n`, an integer between 1 and 100, and `s`, a string made up of only "U" and "D".

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: case is a tuple where case[0] is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and case[1] is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", representing the state of each coin ("U" for facing up and "D" for facing down).
def func_2(case):
    ups = sum(1 for c in case[1] if c == 'U')
    return 'YES' if ups % 2 else 'NO'
    #The program returns 'YES' if the count of "U" in the string `case[1]` is odd, otherwise it returns 'NO'.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic step-by-step based on the problem description:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Game Rules:**
   - Players take turns removing a facing-up ('U') coin.
   - When a coin is removed, its two adjacent coins are flipped.
   - If there are only two coins left, removing one leaves the other unchanged.
   - If there is only one coin left, no flips occur.
   - The player who cannot make a move (i.e., no facing-up coins remain) loses.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice (the first player) can always force a win by playing optimally.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob (the second player) can always force a win by playing optimally.

3. **Program Explanation:**
   - **Function `func_1`:** Reads input data from standard input, parses the number of test cases, and collects each test case's details (number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the coins).
   - **Function `func_2`:** Takes a test case (a tuple `(n, s)`), counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s`, and determines the winner based on whether this count is odd or even.

4. **Logic Verification:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly identifies the winner by checking the parity of the number of 'U' characters.
   - If the count of 'U' is odd, it returns 'YES', indicating Alice wins.
   - If the count of 'U' is even, it returns 'NO', indicating Bob wins.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic needed to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness:** **True**
