In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range defined by the variable `numCases`. The loop will execute if `numCases` is at least 1. The variable `t` is mentioned as an integer within a specific range (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), but it is not directly involved in controlling the loop's execution.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of `numCases` to be at least 1. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself and does not need to be adjusted beforehand.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is initialized by the loop**
