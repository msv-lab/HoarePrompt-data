### Reasoning:

To solve this problem optimally, we need to maximize the score by selecting pairs of numbers such that the sum of the minimums of these pairs is maximized. The key insight here is that sorting the numbers in ascending order and then pairing them consecutively will yield the maximum score. This is because, in a sorted list, the smallest numbers are paired together, ensuring that the minimum of each pair is as large as possible.

Let's break down the program step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Reading Test Case Details**: For each test case, it reads the integer `n` (which indicates there are `2n` numbers) and then reads the `2n` numbers.
3. **Sorting**: The numbers are sorted in ascending order.
4. **Pairing and Summing**: The program then repeatedly pops the first two elements from the sorted list, calculates their minimum, and adds this to the score. This process continues until all numbers are paired and removed from the list.
5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the computed score for each test case.

This approach ensures that the minimum of each pair is as large as possible, leading to the maximum possible score.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 1`, numbers = `[2, 3]`
  - Sorted numbers: `[2, 3]`
  - Pair: `(2, 3)`, min = `2`
  - Score: `2`

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 2`, numbers = `[1, 1, 2, 1]`
  - Sorted numbers: `[1, 1, 1, 2]`
  - Pairs: `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, mins = `1` and `1`
  - Score: `1 + 1 = 2`

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, numbers = `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Sorted numbers: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Pairs: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 1)`, and `(1, 1)`, mins = `1`, `1`, and `1`
  - Score: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`

The program correctly computes the maximum score for each test case as per the examples provided.

### Conclusion:

Given the logic and the verification with example test cases, the program appears to be correct.

**Correctness: True**
