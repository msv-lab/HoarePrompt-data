To determine what will be printed by the `print(suma)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the given information step-by-step:

1. **Variable Initialization and Context**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive). This represents the number of test cases or iterations.
   - `numCases` is greater than or equal to 1, indicating there is at least one case to process.
   - `i` is incremented by 1, suggesting it might be used as a loop counter.
   - `numInteger` is an integer value provided by user input, representing the number of integers in a particular case.
   - `numbers` is an initially empty list that presumably gets populated with integers.
   - `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of numbers that were originally in `numbers`.

2. **Understanding `suma` Calculation**:
   - `suma` is described as the sum of the minimum values of each pair of numbers in the `numbers` list.
   - However, the exact mechanism of how pairs are formed and how `suma` is calculated from these pairs isn't explicitly detailed in the initial state. Typically, this would involve iterating over all possible pairs of numbers in the list and summing up their minimum values.

3. **Current State Before Print Statement**:
   - Since `numbers` is initialized as an empty list and no specific operations are mentioned to populate it before the `print(suma)` statement, we assume that `numbers` remains empty.
   - If `numbers` is empty, there are no pairs to consider, and thus the sum of the minimum values of these non-existent pairs would logically be 0.

Given this analysis, the value of `suma` would be 0 because there are no numbers to form pairs and compute minimum values from.

Therefore, the output of the `print(suma)` statement will be:

Output: **0**
