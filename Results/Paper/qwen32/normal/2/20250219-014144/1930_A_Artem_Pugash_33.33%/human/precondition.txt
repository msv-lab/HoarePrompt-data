test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case. Each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). The first element of each tuple is the integer n, and the subsequent 2n elements are the integers written on the whiteboard for that test case.
