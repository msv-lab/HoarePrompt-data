The code assigns the value of `mak` to `mak2`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the value of `mak2` will be the same as the value of `mak`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `mak` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) where the input was `'<'`, and `mak2` is equal to `mak`.**
