The value of `mak` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `mak` now holds the value that `i` had before being incremented. The string `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `s` is the string input by the user; `mak` is the previous value of `i`.**
