Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴
- `mak` is 0

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Literal String**: The first argument in the `print` function is `'?'`, which is a literal string. This means it will always print the character `?`.

2. **Variable `mak`**: The variable `mak` is explicitly stated to be `0` in the initial state. Therefore, both instances of `mak` in the print statement will print `0`.

3. **Variable `i`**: The variable `i` is not mentioned in the initial state. Since `i` is not defined before the print statement, it would normally result in a `NameError` if the code were actually run. However, based on the task instructions, we should assume that `i` is intended to be a variable whose value is not provided in the initial state. Since no specific value for `i` is given, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, we'll describe it as `i` without assigning any specific value.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the output will be:
- The literal string `?`
- The value of `mak` which is `0`
- The value of `mak` again which is `0`
- The value of `i` which is unknown but represented as `i`

Thus, the final output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 i i (where i is an undefined variable)**
