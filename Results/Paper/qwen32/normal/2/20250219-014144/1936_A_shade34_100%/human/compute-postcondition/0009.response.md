The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

From the given information:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `mak` is `i` if the input received is the string `'<'`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0.
- The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n-1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken on some value between 1 and `n-2` (since the loop will continue as long as `i < n`). To start the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Thus, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration. The variable `n` does not change; it remains the same throughout the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\), and `mak` is `i` if the input received is the string `'<'`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To put it precisely, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\), `mak` is `i` if the input received is the string `'<'`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0, `i` is \(x + 1\)**.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can generalize it as:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\), `mak` is `i` if the input received is the string `'<'`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0, `i` is incremented by 1**.

However, to match the format of the previous examples, we can say:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\), `mak` is `i` if the input received is the string `'<'`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0, `i` is the next integer in the sequence starting from 1 up to \(n-1\)**.

For clarity, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\), `mak` is `i` if the input received is the string `'<'`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0, `i` is 4**.

Generalizing this:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\), `mak` is `i` if the input received is the string `'<'`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0, `i` is incremented by 1**.

So the final answer is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\), `mak` is `i` if the input received is the string `'<'`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0, `i` is incremented by 1**.
