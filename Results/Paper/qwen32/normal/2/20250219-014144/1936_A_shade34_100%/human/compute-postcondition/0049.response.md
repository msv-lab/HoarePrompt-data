The code snippet `pans.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `pans`. This means that the list `pans` will now include the new value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `mak` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) where the input was `'<'`, `mak2` is equal to `mak` if `s` is not `'<'`, otherwise `mak2` is the previous value of `mak`, `pans` is a list containing the current value of `i` if `s` is `'<'`, and if `s` is `'='`, `pans` contains the previous elements plus `i`, `i` is `i + 1`, `s` is the string input from the user, and `pans` now includes the new value of `i`.**
