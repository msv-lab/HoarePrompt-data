The code appends the current value of `i` to the list `pans`. Given that `i` is incremented by 1 before this line, `pans` will now include this incremented value. The values of `s` (the string input by the user) and the initial state of `i` (before being incremented) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `s` is the string input by the user; `pans` includes the incremented value of `i`.**
