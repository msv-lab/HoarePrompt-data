To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `len(pans)`. 

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `mak` is either the original value of `i` (if the input is not '>') or the new value of `i` (if the input is '>').
- `mak2` remains unchanged.
- `pans` is a list of indices with at least two elements.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

The loop condition is `for i in range(1, len(pans))`, which means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(pans)`.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:** At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the next integer value.
2. **Variable `len(pans)`:** This does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.

### Adjustment:
- Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`.
- `mak` and `mak2` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.
- `pans` remains unchanged.

### Example:
If at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 3.

### Conclusion:
State: **`mak` is either the original value of `i` (if the input is not '>') or the new value of `i` (if the input is '>'), `mak2` remains unchanged, `pans` is a list of indices with at least two elements, `i` is incremented by 1**

Given the above, if `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`mak` is either the original value of `i` (if the input is not '>') or the new value of `i` (if the input is '>'), `mak2` remains unchanged, `pans` is a list of indices with at least two elements, `i` is 3**

Generalizing this, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`mak` is either the original value of `i` (if the input is not '>') or the new value of `i` (if the input is '>'), `mak2` remains unchanged, `pans` is a list of indices with at least two elements, `i` is x + 1**

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we express the state in terms of `i` being incremented by 1:

State: **`mak` is either the original value of `i` (if the input is not '>') or the new value of `i` (if the input is '>'), `mak2` remains unchanged, `pans` is a list of indices with at least two elements, `i` is incremented by 1**
