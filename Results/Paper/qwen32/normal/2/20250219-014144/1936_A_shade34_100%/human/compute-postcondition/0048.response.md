The given code snippet reassigns `pans` to a new list containing only the current value of `i`. This means that any previous contents of `pans` are discarded.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴
- `mak` is the current value of `i`
- `mak2` is equal to `mak` if `s` is not `'<'`, otherwise `mak2` is the previous value of `mak`
- `pans` is a list containing the current value of `i` if `s` is `'<'`, and if `s` is `'='`, `pans` contains the previous elements plus `i`
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `s` is the string input from the user

After executing `pans = [i]`, the new state of `pans` is a list containing only the current value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `mak` is the current value of `i`, `mak2` is equal to `mak` if `s` is not `'<'`, otherwise `mak2` is the previous value of `mak`, `pans` is a list containing the current value of `i`, `i` is `i + 1`, `s` is the string input from the user.**
