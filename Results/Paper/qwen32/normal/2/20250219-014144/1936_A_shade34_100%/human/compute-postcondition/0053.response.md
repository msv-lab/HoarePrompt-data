The code snippet sets the variable `mak` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `mak2`, or `pans`. Therefore, the only change is that `mak` is now 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is equal to `mak` if the last input was `'<'`, otherwise it is the previous value of `mak`, and `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` where the input was `'='`, and the last index `i` where the input was `'<'` (if any).**
