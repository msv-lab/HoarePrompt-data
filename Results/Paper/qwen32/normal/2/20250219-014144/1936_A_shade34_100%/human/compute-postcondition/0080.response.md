The given code snippet assigns the value of `i` to the variable `mak`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, and `pans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is equal to `i`, `mak2` is equal to its previous value, and `pans` is unchanged.**
