To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and how the variables are used in the statement:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- **`mak`**: This variable is set to either 0 (if the input is not '>') or the value of `i` (if the input is '>').
- **`mak2`**: This variable remains unchanged, but it is not used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
- **`pans`**: This is a list of indices with at least two elements.
- **`i`**: This variable is incremented by 1 before the `print` statement is executed.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

#### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **`'?'`**: This is a literal string that will be printed as is.
2. **`pans[mak]`**: 
   - If the input is not '>', then `mak` is 0, so this will print the element at index 0 of the `pans` list.
   - If the input is '>', then `mak` is the value of `i` before it was incremented. So this will print the element at the index that `i` had before being incremented.
3. **`pans[mak]`**: This is repeated, so it will print the same value as the previous `pans[mak]`.
4. **`pans[i]`**: 
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 before the `print` statement, this will print the element at the new index `i` in the `pans` list.
5. **`pans[i]`**: This is repeated, so it will print the same value as the previous `pans[i]`.

### Final Output Description:
- The first element to be printed is the literal string `'?'`.
- The next two elements are `pans[mak]`, which depends on the value of `mak`:
  - If the input is not '>', `mak` is 0, so it prints `pans[0]`.
  - If the input is '>', `mak` is the old value of `i`, so it prints `pans[old_i]`.
- The last two elements are `pans[i]`, where `i` is the new value after incrementing:
  - It prints `pans[new_i]`.

Given the information, we can describe the output precisely as follows:

Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]] (where mak is 0 if the input is not '>', otherwise it is the old value of i, and i is the new value after incrementing)**
