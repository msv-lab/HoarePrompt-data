The given code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This command flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the standard output immediately. It does not affect any of the variables `t`, `n`, `mak`, `mak2`, `pans`, or `i`.

Therefore, the Output State remains unchanged except for the fact that the output buffer is flushed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `mak` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) where the input was `'<'`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is a list, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, and the output buffer is flushed.**
