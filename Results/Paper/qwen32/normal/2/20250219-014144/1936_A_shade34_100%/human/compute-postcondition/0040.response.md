The code snippet appends the current value of `i` to the list `pans`. The values of `t`, `n`, `mak`, `mak2`, and `s` remain unchanged. The only change is that `pans` now includes the new element `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `mak` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) where the input was `'<'`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is a list containing the previous elements plus `i`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `s` is the string input from the user.**
