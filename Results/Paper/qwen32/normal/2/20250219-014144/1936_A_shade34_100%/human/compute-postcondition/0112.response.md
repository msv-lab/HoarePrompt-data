The code snippet `pans = [i]` assigns a new list containing only the current value of `i` to the variable `pans`. This means `pans` loses its previous value and now holds a list with a single element, which is the current value of `i`.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `mak` remains the previous value of `i` plus 1.
- `mak2` remains the largest integer i (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was '<'.
- `pans` is now a list containing the current value of `i`.
- `i` remains the previous value of `i` plus 1.
- `s` remains the string input by the user.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `mak2` is the largest integer i (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was '<', `pans` is a list containing the current value of `i`, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `s` is the string input by the user.**
