Functionality: **For each test case consisting of an integer `n` and a permutation `p` of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}, the function determines and outputs the index of the largest element in the permutation (`mak2`) and the index of the smallest element among those with the maximum value in the permutation (`pans[mak]`).**
