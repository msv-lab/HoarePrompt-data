To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State:
- `i` is incremented by 1. This means that `i` was some value before this operation, and now it is one more than that value.
- There is no explicit mention of the initial values of `mak`, `mak2`, or the previous value of `i`.

### Variables:
- `mak`: This variable's value is unknown from the given information.
- `mak2`: This variable's value is also unknown from the given information.
- `i`: Initially, `i` had some value, let's call it `i_initial`. After the increment, `i` is now `i_initial + 1`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Explanation:
- The print statement will output a question mark (`?`), followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, the new value of `i`, and `mak2` again.

Given that the exact values of `mak` and `mak2` are not specified, we can only describe their roles in the output.

### Output:
Output: **? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] (where mak is the value of mak, mak2 is the value of mak2, and i is the value of i after being incremented by 1)**
