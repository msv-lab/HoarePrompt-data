The given code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of any variables. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any buffered output is written to the standard output immediately. Since there are no changes to the variables `n` and `i`, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is 4**.
