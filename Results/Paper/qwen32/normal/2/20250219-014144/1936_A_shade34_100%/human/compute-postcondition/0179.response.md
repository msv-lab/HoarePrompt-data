Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is the highest index i (from 1 to n-1) where the response was '<', `mak2` is the highest index i (from 1 to n-1) where the response was '<'. If `s` is equal to '<', `mak` is updated to `i`, `pans` is `[i]`. If `s` is equal to '=', `pans` is a list containing the value `i`. Otherwise, `pans` remains an empty list.**
