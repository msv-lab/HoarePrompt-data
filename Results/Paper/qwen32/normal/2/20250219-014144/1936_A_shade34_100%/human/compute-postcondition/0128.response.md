To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³. This variable does not directly affect the print statement.
- `n` is unchanged. The value of `n` is not specified, but it does not appear in the print statement.
- `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` is unchanged. The value of `mak2` is not specified, but it does not appear in the print statement.
- `pans` must contain at least two elements. The specific values of the elements in `pans` are not provided, but we know that `pans` is a list with at least two elements.

Given the print statement:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

Let's break down the components:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `pans[mak]`: Since `mak` is 0, this refers to the first element of the `pans` list, i.e., `pans[0]`.
- `pans[mak]`: This is the same as the previous one, so it also refers to `pans[0]`.
- `pans[i]`: The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `pans[i]` cannot be determined from the given information.

Since `i` is not defined, we cannot specify the exact values of `pans[i]` in the output. However, we can describe the output in terms of the elements of the `pans` list.

Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]] (where pans[0] is the first element of the pans list and i is an undefined index)**
