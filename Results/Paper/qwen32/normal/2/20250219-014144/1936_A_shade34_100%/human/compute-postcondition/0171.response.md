`s` is assigned the value of `str(input())`, which means `s` will hold the string input from the user. The values of `t`, `n`, `mak`, `mak2`, and `pans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is the highest index i (from 1 to n-1) where the response was '<', `mak2` is the highest index i (from 1 to n-1) where the response was '<', `pans` is an empty list, `s` is the string input from the user.**
