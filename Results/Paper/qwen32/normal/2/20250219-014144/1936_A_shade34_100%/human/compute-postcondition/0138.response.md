The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(pans)`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables for the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³ (unchanged)
- `n` is unchanged
- `mak2` is unchanged
- `pans` contains at least two elements
- `i` is 2
- If the input is '>', then `mak` is set to 2 (this does not affect the loop head)

The loop condition is `for i in range(1, len(pans))`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(pans)`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. The length of `pans` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is unchanged, `mak2` is unchanged, `pans` contains at least three elements, `i` is 3**
