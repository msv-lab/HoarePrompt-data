Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `mak2` is the largest integer i (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was '<', `pans` is a list, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `s` is the string input by the user.**

Explanation: The value of `mak` has been updated to the new value of `i`, which is the previous value of `i` plus 1. All other variables retain their original values and conditions.
