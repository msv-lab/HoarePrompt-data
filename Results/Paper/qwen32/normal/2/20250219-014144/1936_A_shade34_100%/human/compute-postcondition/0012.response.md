Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\); `mak` is `i`; `i` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `mak` is now set to the current value of `i`. The variable `i` has been incremented by 1. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
