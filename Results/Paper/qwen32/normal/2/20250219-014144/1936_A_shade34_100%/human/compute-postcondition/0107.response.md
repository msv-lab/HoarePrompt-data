The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must remain the same.

Given the description, `mak` and `mak2` are updated based on the input `s` within the loop, but they are not part of the loop head, so we do not adjust them. Similarly, `pans` is modified based on the input `s`, but it is also not part of the loop head, so we do not adjust it either.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is the largest integer i (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was '<', `mak2` is the largest integer i (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was '<', and `pans` is a list. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.** 

Since the exact previous value of `i` is not specified, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is the largest integer i (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was '<', `mak2` is the largest integer i (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was '<', and `pans` is a list. `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1.**
