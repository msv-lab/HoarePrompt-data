The code snippet `pans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. Since the initial state specifies that `pans` is an empty list, after executing this line, `pans` will contain one element, which is the value of `i`.

However, the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value that is appended to `pans`. We only know that `pans` will no longer be empty and will contain the value of `i`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak`, `mak2`, `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `mak` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) where the input was `'<'`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is a list containing the value of `i`, `s` is the string input by the user, `s` is not equal to `'<'`, and `s` is equal to `'='`.**
