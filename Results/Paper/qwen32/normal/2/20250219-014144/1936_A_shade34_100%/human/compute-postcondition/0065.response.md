The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(pans)`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is unchanged, meaning it holds the value from the previous iteration. Since the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `len(pans) - 1`, `i` should be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration to proceed to the next element in the list.

Given that `pans` is a list containing at least two elements, `len(pans)` will be at least 2. For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `len(pans)`.

So, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `mak2` is equal to its previous value, `mak` is set to `i` if the input is `'>'`; otherwise, `mak` remains unchanged, `pans` is a list containing at least two elements, and `i` is incremented by 1**. 

To be more precise:
- `i` is now `i + 1`.
- `len(pans)` remains the same as it is determined by the length of the list `pans`.

Therefore, the final state before the next iteration starts is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `mak2` is equal to its previous value, `mak` is set to `i` if the input is `'>'`; otherwise, `mak` remains unchanged, `pans` is a list containing at least two elements, and `i` is `i + 1`**.
