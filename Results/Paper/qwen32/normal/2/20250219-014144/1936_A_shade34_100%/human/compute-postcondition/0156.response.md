To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the initial state and analyze each variable involved:

1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This variable does not appear in the print statement, so it doesn't affect the output.
2. **`n`**: Greater than 1. This variable also does not appear in the print statement, so it doesn't affect the output.
3. **`mak2`**: Mentioned as "unchanged," but it does not appear in the print statement, so it doesn't affect the output.
4. **`pans`**: Contains all indices where the response was '=', or only the last index where the response was '<' if there was one. This variable does not appear in the print statement, so it doesn't affect the output.
5. **`mak`**: This variable is referenced twice in the print statement. Since its value is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, we can denote it as `mak`.
6. **`i`**: Initially described as `i + 1`. This implies that `i` is being incremented by 1 before the print statement is executed. Therefore, the value of `i` in the print statement is the current value of `i` plus 1.

Given this analysis, the print statement `print('?', mak, mak, i, i)` will output the following:
- The first argument is a literal question mark (`?`).
- The second and third arguments are both `mak`.
- The fourth and fifth arguments are both `i + 1`.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **? mak mak i+1 i+1 (where mak is the value of mak and i+1 is the incremented value of i)**
