To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³. However, `t` is not used in the print statement.
- `n` is mentioned as "unchanged," but it is not used in the print statement.
- `mak2` is mentioned as "unchanged," but it is not used in the print statement.
- `pans` is a list that contains at least two elements.
- `i` is set to 2.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `mak` is not explicitly defined, so we cannot determine its value directly from the given information. However, since `mak` is used as an index to access elements in the `pans` list, it must be a valid index (an integer) within the bounds of the list.
- `i` is explicitly set to 2, so `pans[i]` refers to the third element of the `pans` list (since list indices start at 0).

Given this, the output will be:
- `'?'`: This is a literal string.
- `pans[mak]`: This is the element at index `mak` in the `pans` list. Since `mak` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value, but it will be one of the elements in the `pans` list.
- `pans[mak]`: This is the same as the previous item, so it will also be the element at index `mak` in the `pans` list.
- `pans[i]`: Since `i` is 2, this will be the third element of the `pans` list.
- `pans[i]`: This is the same as the previous item, so it will also be the third element of the `pans` list.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[2]] [pans[2]] (where mak is an index in the pans list and pans[2] is the third element of the pans list)**
