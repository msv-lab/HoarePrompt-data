The code snippet initializes a variable `i` to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from input, where `n` and `k` are the first and second values respectively from a space-separated pair of integers; `i` is 0.**
