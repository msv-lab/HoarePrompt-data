To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the condition under which the loop terminates. The loop continues as long as \( 1 << (i + 1) \leq k \). This means the loop will keep running until \( 2^{(i + 1)} \) exceeds \( k \).

From the provided output states after the first three iterations, we observe:
- After 1 iteration, \( i \) becomes 1, meaning \( 2^{(1 + 1)} = 4 \leq k \).
- After 2 iterations, \( i \) becomes 2, meaning \( 2^{(2 + 1)} = 8 \leq k \).
- After 3 iterations, \( i \) becomes 3, meaning \( 2^{(3 + 1)} = 16 \leq k \).

The loop will terminate when \( 2^{(i + 1)} > k \). Therefore, the final value of \( i \) will be such that \( 2^{(i + 1)} \) is the smallest power of 2 greater than \( k \).

Let's denote the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \) as \( 2^m \). Then \( m \) is the largest integer such that \( 2^m \leq k \), and the loop will run until \( i = m \).

Thus, the loop will terminate with \( i = m \), where \( m \) is the largest integer such that \( 2^m \leq k \).

Given the pattern from the previous iterations, the final state will be:
- `i` will be the largest integer such that \( 2^{(i + 1)} > k \).
- The list remains unchanged except for the exclusion of \( 2^i \).
- `n` and `tc` remain unchanged.

In natural language, the final output state is when the loop stops because the next power of 2 would exceed \( k \). At this point, `i` will be the highest integer such that \( 2^{(i + 1)} \) is greater than \( k \).

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, the list is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding the value `2^i`, `tc` is 2, `i` is the largest integer such that `2^(i + 1) > k`.**
