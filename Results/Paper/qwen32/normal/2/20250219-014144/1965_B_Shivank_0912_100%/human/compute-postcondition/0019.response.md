The only variable in the loop head is `j`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than 20. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer read from input; `k` is an integer read from input; `i` is floor(log2(k)); `j` is 2. If `j` is not equal to `i`, `ans` is a list containing five elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains a list containing either three elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` or four elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1]` depending on the initial state of `ans`.**
