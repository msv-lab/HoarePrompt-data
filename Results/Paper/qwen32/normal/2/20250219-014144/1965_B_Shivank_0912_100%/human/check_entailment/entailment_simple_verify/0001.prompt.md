You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4

    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        i = 0
        while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
            i = i + 1
        ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
        for j in range(20):
            if j != i:
                ans.append(1 << j)
        print(len(ans))
        print(*ans)

        print(*ans)
        
    #State: For each test case, the output consists of the length of the list `ans` followed by the elements of the list `ans`, where `ans` is constructed as described above for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it correctly solves the problem according to the given requirements.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. We need a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
2. There should be no subsequence of `a` whose sum equals `k`.
3. For every integer `v` from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`), there must exist a subsequence of `a` whose sum equals `v`.

### Analysis of the Program:

The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`. Then, it constructs a sequence `ans` as follows:

1. It finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`, denoted as `1 << i`.
2. It initializes the sequence `ans` with three elements:
   - `k - (1 << i)`
   - `k + 1`
   - `k + 1 + (1 << i)`
3. It then appends powers of 2 (from `1 << 0` to `1 << 19`) to `ans`, excluding the power of 2 that was used to find `i`.

#### Let's Examine Why This Works:

- **No Subsequence Sum Equals `k`:**
  - The element `k - (1 << i)` ensures that the smallest possible sum involving this element is at least `k` (since `(1 << i)` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`).
  - The elements `k + 1` and `k + 1 + (1 << i)` ensure that the smallest possible sum involving these elements is greater than `k`.
  - Since the remaining elements added are powers of 2 (and none of them can combine to form `k` due to the construction logic), no subsequence can sum to `k`.

- **Subsequences Can Form All Sums from 1 to `n` (Except `k`):**
  - By including all powers of 2 up to `1 << 19`, the sequence can form all sums that are combinations of these powers of 2.
  - The specific values chosen (`k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`) do not interfere with forming sums from 1 to `n` except for `k` itself.
  - Given the constraints, the sequence can indeed form all required sums.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to construct a valid sequence `a` that meets the problem's requirements for each test case.
