The code appends `1 << j` to the list `ans`. Given that `j` is initially 0 and `j` is not equal to `i`, the value being appended is `1 << 0`, which equals 1.

Therefore, the list `ans` now contains four elements: `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1]`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer read from input; `k` is an integer read from input; `i` is floor(log2(k)); `ans` is a list containing four elements: `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1]`; `j` is 0 and `j` is not equal to `i`.**
