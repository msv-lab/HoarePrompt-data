To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, we need to analyze the initial state provided:

- The list `ans` is defined as `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536]` excluding \(2^i\).

Let's break down the components of the list:

1. **\(k - (1 << i)\)**: This term represents \(k\) minus \(2^i\).
2. **\(k + 1\)**: This term represents \(k\) plus 1.
3. **\(k + 1 + (1 << i)\)**: This term represents \(k\) plus 1 plus \(2^i\).
4. **Powers of 2**: The sequence from 1 to 65536 (which are powers of 2: \(2^0\) to \(2^{16}\)) is included in the list, except for \(2^i\).

Given that the list excludes \(2^i\), we need to identify which power of 2 is excluded based on the value of \(i\). The powers of 2 in the list are \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, \ldots, 2^{16}\).

Thus, the list `ans` will contain all these values except \(2^i\).

### Output Description

The `print(*ans)` statement will print all the elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces. Since \(2^i\) is excluded, it will not appear in the printed output.

Output: **k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536 (excluding 2^i)**
