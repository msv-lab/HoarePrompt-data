Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer read from input; `k` is an integer read from input; `i` is floor(log2(k)); `ans` is a list containing either three elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` or four elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1]` depending on whether `j` is not equal to `i`; `j` is 0. If `j` is not equal to `i`, `ans` includes an additional element `1` at the end.**
