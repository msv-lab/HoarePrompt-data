Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from input, where `n` and `k` are the first and second values respectively from a space-separated pair of integers.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was initially defined. Two new variables `n` and `k` are introduced and assigned the values of the first and second integers from a space-separated input pair, respectively.
