The code snippet reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The values of `n` and `k` for each test case are not yet read or processed by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^7.**
