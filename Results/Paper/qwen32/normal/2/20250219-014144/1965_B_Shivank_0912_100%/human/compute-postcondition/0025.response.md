The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `tc` and `t`. If `tc` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `tc` is 1 (since it starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration). For the loop to execute one more time, `tc` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `t` remains unchanged.

State: **[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072] excluding the value 2^i, `tc` is 2**
