To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all 20 iterations, we need to understand how the loop modifies the `ans` list based on the value of `j` and `i`.

Here's the breakdown of the loop's behavior:

- The loop runs for `j` from 0 to 19.
- For each iteration, if `j` is not equal to `i`, the value `1 << j` (which is \(2^j\)) is appended to the `ans` list.

Initially, `ans` contains three elements: `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`.

During each iteration:
- If `j` is not equal to `i`, `2^j` is added to `ans`.
- If `j` is equal to `i`, nothing is added to `ans`.

Since the loop runs 20 times, and `i` is a specific value between 0 and 9 (because `k` is at most 1000, and \(\lfloor \log_2(1000) \rfloor = 9\)), there will be 19 values of `j` that are not equal to `i` (since one value of `j` will be equal to `i`).

Thus, the `ans` list will have its initial three elements plus 19 additional elements, making it a total of 22 elements.

The final `ans` list will be: `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]`, excluding the value `2^i`.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072] excluding the value 2^i**.

In simpler terms, the final `ans` list contains the initial three elements plus all powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{19}\) except for \(2^i\).
