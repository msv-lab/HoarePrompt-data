To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop statement:

```python
while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The condition `1 << i + 1 <= k` translates to `2^(i+1) <= k`. This means that for the loop to execute again, `2^(i+1)` must be less than or equal to `k`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an input integer (no specific value given).
- `k` must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `i` is 1.
- The list is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding the value `2^i`.
- `tc` is 3.
- `ans` is the same list as above.

Since `i` is 1, the current condition checks if `2^(1+1) <= k`, which simplifies to `4 <= k`. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be such that `2^(i+1) <= k` holds true when `i` is incremented.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to make sure that after the next iteration (where `i` would be incremented by 1), the condition still holds. Therefore, `k` should be at least `2^(i+2)` when `i` is 1, which means `k` should be at least `2^3 = 8`.

Thus, `k` must be adjusted to be at least 8 to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 8, `i` is 1, the list is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding the value `2^i`, `tc` is 3, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding `2^i`**
