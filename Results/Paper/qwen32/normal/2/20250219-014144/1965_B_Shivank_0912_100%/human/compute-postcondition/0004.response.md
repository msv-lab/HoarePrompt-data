To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, let's analyze the loop condition:

The loop condition is `1 << i + 1 <= k`.

Here, `1 << i` represents a bitwise left shift operation, which is equivalent to \(2^i\). Therefore, the condition can be rewritten as:

\[ 2^{(i + 1)} \leq k \]

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer read from input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` and `k` are integers read from input, where `n` and `k` are the first and second values respectively from a space-separated pair of integers.
- `i` is 0.

Substituting `i = 0` into the loop condition:

\[ 2^{(0 + 1)} \leq k \]
\[ 2 \leq k \]

For the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be at least 2. No other variables (`t` and `n`) are involved in the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state needs to be modified such that `k` is at least 2.

State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer read from input; `k` must be at least 2; `i` is 0**
