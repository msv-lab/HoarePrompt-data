The code appends `1 << j` to the list `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is `i_final`, `tc` is 3, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j]`, and `j` is not equal to `i`.**

This means that the list `ans` now includes an additional element `1 << j` at the end, while all other variables retain their initial values.
