To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ans))` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state provided:

### Initial State Analysis:
- We have a list that includes elements from the sequence: `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536]`.
- The list excludes the element \(2^i\).

### Understanding the List Elements:
- The sequence starts with three specific elements related to `k` and `i`: 
  - `k - (1 << i)`
  - `k + 1`
  - `k + 1 + (1 << i)`
- Followed by powers of 2 up to \(2^{16}\).
- The element \(2^i\) is excluded from this list.

### Counting the Elements:
- The sequence of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{16}\) includes 17 elements.
- Adding the three specific elements (`k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`) brings the total to 20 elements.
- Since one element (\(2^i\)) is excluded, the final count of elements in the list is \(20 - 1 = 19\).

### Conclusion:
The variable `ans` is assumed to be the list described above. Therefore, the length of `ans` is 19.

Output: **19**
