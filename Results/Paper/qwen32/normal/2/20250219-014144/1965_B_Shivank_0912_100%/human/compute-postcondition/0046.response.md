To determine the final output state after all 20 iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the `ans` list. The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to 19, appending `1 << j` to `ans` unless `j` equals `i`.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the final `ans` list will include:
- The initial three elements: `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`
- All powers of 2 from `1 << 0` to `1 << 19` except `1 << i`

Let's break down the final state:
- `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- The list `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding the value `2^i` remains unchanged.
- `tc` remains 2 as it is not modified within the loop.
- `i` remains the largest integer such that `2^(i + 1) > k`.
- `ans` will be `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding `2^i`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, the list is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding the value `2^i`, `tc` is 2, `i` is the largest integer such that `2^(i + 1) > k`, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding `2^i`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the `ans` list contains the initial three elements plus all powers of 2 from 1 to 1048576 (which is `2^20`) except for the power of 2 corresponding to `2^i`.
