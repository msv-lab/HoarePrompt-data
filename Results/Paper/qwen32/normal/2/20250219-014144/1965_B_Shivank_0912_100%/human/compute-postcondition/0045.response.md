Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, the list is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding the value `2^i`, `tc` is 2, `i` is the largest integer such that `2^(i + 1) > k`, `j` is 19. If `j` is not equal to `i`, `ans` includes `524288`.**
