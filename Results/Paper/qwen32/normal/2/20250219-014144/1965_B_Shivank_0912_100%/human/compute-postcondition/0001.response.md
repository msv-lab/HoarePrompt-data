In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases. To ensure that the loop executes, we need to focus on the variable `tc` (the loop variable) and `t` (the range limit).

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Variable (`tc`)**: This variable is initialized automatically by the `range(t)` function and does not need to be set manually before the loop starts. It will take values from 0 up to `t-1`.

2. **Range Limit (`t`)**: This variable determines how many times the loop will execute. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given the problem constraints, `t` is already defined as an integer read from input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). Therefore, `t` is guaranteed to be greater than 0, and no adjustment is needed for `t`.

Since the loop variable `tc` is managed by the `range(t)` function, there is no need to adjust its initial value either.

Thus, the state before the loop starts is already sufficient for the loop to execute as intended.

State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000**
