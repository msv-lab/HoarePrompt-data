Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers where 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is `min(n, b)`**

Natural Language: The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as integers within the range of 1 to 10^9. The new variable `low` is set to 0, and the new variable `high` is set to the minimum value between `n` and `b`.
