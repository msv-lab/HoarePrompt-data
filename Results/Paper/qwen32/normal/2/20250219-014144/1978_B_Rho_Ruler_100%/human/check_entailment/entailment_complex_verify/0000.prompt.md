You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9

    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
Bob wants to maximize his profit by selling `n` buns. He can sell the first `k` buns at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b-k+1`, and the remaining `n-k` buns at the usual price `a`.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(k, n, a, b)`: Computes the profit for a given `k`.
2. `func_2(n, a, b)`: Uses binary search to find the value of `k` that maximizes the profit.

#### Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`:
- This function calculates the profit if the first `k` buns are sold at the modified prices and the remaining `n-k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
- The formula used is:
  \[
  \text{profit} = k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a
  \]
- This formula correctly calculates the sum of the arithmetic series for the first `k` buns and adds the profit from the remaining `n-k` buns sold at the usual price `a`.

#### Function `func_2(n, a, b)`:
- This function uses binary search to find the value of `k` that maximizes the profit.
- It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `min(n, b)`.
- It iteratively checks the profit at the midpoint (`mid`) and the next point (`mid + 1`).
- If the profit at `mid + 1` is greater than the profit at `mid`, it moves the lower bound up (`low = mid + 1`); otherwise, it moves the upper bound down (`high = mid - 1`).
- It keeps track of the maximum profit found during the search.

### Correctness Check:
To verify the correctness of the program, we need to ensure that it handles all edge cases and provides the correct maximum profit for any valid input within the constraints.

#### Edge Cases:
1. **All buns sold at usual price (`k=0`)**:
   - When `b < a`, it should be optimal to sell all buns at the usual price.
   - Example: `n=10, a=10, b=5` should result in a profit of `100`.

2. **All buns sold at modified price (`k=n`)**:
   - When `b` is sufficiently large, it might be optimal to sell all buns at the modified price.
   - Example: `n=5, a=5, b=9` should result in a profit of `35`.

3. **Mixed sales (`0 < k < n`)**:
   - There should be a balance between selling at modified and usual prices.
   - Example: `n=4, a=4, b=5` should result in a profit of `17`.

4. **Large inputs**:
   - The program should handle large values of `n`, `a`, and `b` efficiently.
   - Example: `n=1000000000, a=1000000000, b=1000000000` should result in a profit of `1000000000000000000`.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with the provided examples and some additional edge cases.

```python
#Function 1:
def func_1(k, n, a, b):
    return k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (0, min(n, b))
    max_profit = 0
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)
        profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)
        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)
        if profit_next > profit_mid:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return max_profit

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    (4, 4, 5),  # Expected: 17
    (5, 5, 9),  # Expected: 35
    (10, 10, 5),  # Expected: 100
    (5, 5, 11),  # Expected: 45
    (1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000),  # Expected: 1000000000000000000
    (1000000000, 1000000000, 1),  # Expected: 1000000000000000000
    (1000, 1, 1000),  # Expected: 500500
    (1, 1, 1),  # Expected: 1
    (1, 1, 2),  # Expected: 2
    (2, 1, 2),  # Expected: 3
]

results = [func_2(n, a, b) for n, a, b in test_cases]
expected_results = [17, 35, 100, 45, 1000000000000000000, 1000000000000000000, 500500, 1, 2, 3]

# Verify results
correctness = all(result == expected for result, expected in zip(results, expected_results))
print("Correctness:", correctness)
```
