Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers where 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9; `low` and `high` are integers with `low` being less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`; `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`; `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`; `max_profit` is updated to `max(max_profit, profit_mid)`; If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `profit_next` is updated to the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the given initial state.
