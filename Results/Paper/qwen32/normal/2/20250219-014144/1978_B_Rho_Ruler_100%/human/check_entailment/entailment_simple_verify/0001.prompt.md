You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic and steps involved in the solution.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the maximum profit Bob can make by selling `n` buns under the following conditions:
- The first `k` buns are sold at decreasing prices starting from `b` down to `b-k+1`.
- The remaining `n-k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

The goal is to find the optimal value of `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b)) that maximizes the total profit.

### Solution Approach

The provided solution uses a binary search approach to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit. Here's how it works:

1. **Binary Search Initialization**:
   - `low` is initialized to 0.
   - `high` is initialized to `min(n, b)` because `k` cannot exceed the number of buns or the initial price `b`.

2. **Binary Search Execution**:
   - The loop continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
   - `mid` is calculated as the average of `low` and `high`.
   - `profit_mid` is the profit when `k = mid`.
   - `profit_next` is the profit when `k = mid + 1`.
   - The maximum profit seen so far is updated with `max(max_profit, profit_mid)`.
   - If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, it means increasing `k` could potentially yield a higher profit, so `low` is updated to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1(k, n, a, b)` calculates the profit for a given `k` using the formula:
     \[
     \text{profit} = k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, plus the profit from selling the remaining `n-k` buns at the usual price `a`.

### Correctness Verification

- **Binary Search**: The binary search correctly narrows down the range of possible `k` values to find the one that maximizes the profit. Since the profit function is unimodal (first increasing and then decreasing), binary search is an appropriate method to find the maximum efficiently.
- **Profit Calculation**: The formula used in `func_1` accurately computes the profit for any given `k`. It correctly handles both the decreasing prices for the first `k` buns and the usual price for the remaining buns.
- **Edge Cases**: The solution handles edge cases such as `k = 0` (selling all buns at the usual price) and `k = min(n, b)` (selling the first `k` buns at decreasing prices).

### Conclusion

Given the analysis above, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It efficiently finds the optimal `k` using binary search and accurately calculates the profit for each `k`.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
