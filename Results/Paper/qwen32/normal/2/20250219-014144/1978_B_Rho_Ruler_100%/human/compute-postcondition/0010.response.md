Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers where 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is `mid - 1`; `max_profit` is `max(0, profit_mid)`; `mid` is `(min(n, b)) // 2`; `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`; `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`; `profit_next` is less than or equal to `profit_mid`.**

In simple terms, the value of `high` has been updated to `mid - 1`. All other variables retain their previous values.
