The code snippet updates `max_profit` to be the maximum of its current value and `profit_mid`. Given the initial conditions, the only variable that changes is `max_profit`.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers where 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9; `low` is less than `high`; `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`; `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`; `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`; `max_profit` is updated to `max(max_profit, profit_mid)`**.

In natural language: The value of `max_profit` is now the greater of its previous value and `profit_mid`. All other variables remain unchanged.
