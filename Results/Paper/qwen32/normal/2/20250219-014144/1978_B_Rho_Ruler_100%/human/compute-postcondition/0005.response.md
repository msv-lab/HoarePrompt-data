Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers where 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is `min(n, b)`; `max_profit` is 0; `mid` is `(min(n, b)) // 2`; `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`; `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, `high`, `max_profit`, and `mid` remain unchanged. A new variable `profit_next` is introduced and assigned the value returned by the function `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`.
