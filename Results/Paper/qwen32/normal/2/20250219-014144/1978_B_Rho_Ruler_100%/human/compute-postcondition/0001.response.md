Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers where 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is `min(n, b)`; `max_profit` is 0.**

Natural Language: The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are integers within the specified range. The variable `low` remains 0, and `high` remains `min(n, b)`. The new variable `max_profit` is initialized to 0.
