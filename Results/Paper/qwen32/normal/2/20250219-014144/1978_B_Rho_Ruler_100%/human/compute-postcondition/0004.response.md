Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers where 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is `min(n, b)`; `max_profit` is 0; `mid` is `(min(n, b)) // 2`; `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `profit_mid` is now set to the result of calling `func_1` with the arguments `mid`, `n`, `a`, and `b`. All other variables retain their initial values.
