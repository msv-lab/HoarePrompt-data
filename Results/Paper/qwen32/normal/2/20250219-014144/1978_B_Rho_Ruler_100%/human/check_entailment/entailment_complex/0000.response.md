### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify that it accurately computes the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given conditions.

#### Key Components:

1. **Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the profit for a given `k`.
   - Formula: \( k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \).
   - Explanation:
     - \( k \times b \): Revenue from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price.
     - \( -\frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} \): Adjustment to account for the decreasing price of the first `k` buns.
     - \( (n - k) \times a \): Revenue from selling the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price.

2. **Function `func_2(n, a, b)`**:
   - This function finds the maximum profit by binary searching over possible values of `k`.
   - Range of `k`: \( 0 \le k \le \min(n, b) \).
   - Binary search logic:
     - Calculate profit for `mid` and `mid + 1`.
     - If profit at `mid + 1` is greater, move `low` to `mid + 1`.
     - Otherwise, move `high` to `mid - 1`.
     - Track the maximum profit found during the search.

#### Verification:

- **Binary Search**: The binary search ensures that we efficiently find the optimal `k` within the range \( 0 \le k \le \min(n, b) \). This is crucial given the constraints \( 1 \le n, a, b \le 10^9 \).
- **Profit Calculation**: The formula used in `func_1` correctly computes the profit for any given `k`, taking into account both the modified and usual prices.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as `k = 0` (all buns sold at the usual price) and `k = n` (all buns sold at the modified price).

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It efficiently searches for the optimal `k` and computes the corresponding profit.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
