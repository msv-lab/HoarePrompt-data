### Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum profit Bob can make by selling his buns under the given conditions. The strategy involves choosing an optimal number \( k \) of buns to sell at the modified price, and then selling the remaining buns at the usual price.

#### Steps in the Program:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the total profit for a given \( k \).
   - It computes the profit from selling the first \( k \) buns at the modified price and the remaining \( n-k \) buns at the usual price.
   - The formula used is: 
     \[
     \text{profit} = k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a
     \]
     - \( k \times b \) gives the total price of the first \( k \) buns if they were all sold at the highest modified price \( b \).
     - \( \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} \) subtracts the cumulative decrement from the highest price \( b \) to the lowest price \( b - k + 1 \).
     - \( (n - k) \times a \) adds the profit from selling the remaining buns at the usual price \( a \).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes the search range between 0 and \( \min(n, b) \) because selling more than \( b \) buns at the modified price doesn't make sense (as the price would drop below 0).
   - During each iteration, it calculates the profit for the middle point \( mid \) and the next point \( mid + 1 \).
   - If the profit at \( mid + 1 \) is higher, it moves the lower bound up; otherwise, it moves the upper bound down.
   - It keeps track of the maximum profit found during the search.

#### Verification with Example Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1**: \( n = 4, a = 4, b = 5 \)
  - Optimal \( k = 1 \)
  - Profit: \( 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 \)

- **Test Case 2**: \( n = 5, a = 5, b = 9 \)
  - Optimal \( k = 5 \)
  - Profit: \( 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35 \)

- **Test Case 3**: \( n = 10, a = 10, b = 5 \)
  - Optimal \( k = 0 \)
  - Profit: \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \)

- **Test Case 4**: \( n = 5, a = 5, b = 11 \)
  - Optimal \( k = 5 \)
  - Profit: \( 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 = 45 \)

- **Test Case 5**: \( n = 10^9, a = 10^9, b = 10^9 \)
  - Optimal \( k = 10^9 \)
  - Profit: \( 10^{18} \)

- **Test Case 6**: \( n = 10^9, a = 10^9, b = 1 \)
  - Optimal \( k = 0 \)
  - Profit: \( 10^{18} \)

- **Test Case 7**: \( n = 1000, a = 1, b = 1000 \)
  - Optimal \( k = 1000 \)
  - Profit: \( 500500 \)

All these test cases match the expected results, indicating that the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly determines the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all \( n \) buns under the given conditions.

**Correctness:** **True**
