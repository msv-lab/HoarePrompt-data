To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition `low <= high`. Given the initial state:

- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers where \(1 \leq n, a, b \leq 10^9\)
- `low` is 0
- `high` is `min(n, b)`
- `max_profit` is 0

The loop condition `low <= high` must be true for the loop to execute. Since `low` is initialized to 0, we need to ensure that `high` is at least 0.

Given that `high` is defined as `min(n, b)`, and both `n` and `b` are at least 1 (as per the constraints), `high` will always be at least 1. Therefore, the condition `low <= high` (which translates to `0 <= min(n, b)`) will always be true under the given constraints.

Thus, no adjustments are necessary to ensure the loop executes at least once. The state remains the same.

State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers where 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is `min(n, b)`; `max_profit` is 0**
