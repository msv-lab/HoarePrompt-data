Postcondition: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `length` is 30, `s` is a list of 30 characters representing the binary form of `x`. If `flag` was initially 0 and `s[i]` was '1' and `s[i + 1]` was '1', then `s[i]` is now `'-1'` and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, `s[i]` remains unchanged, and `flag` remains 0 unless it was already 1, in which case `s[i]` is set to `'0'`.**
