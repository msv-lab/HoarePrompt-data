Output State: **The list `s` contains 30 elements, each element being either `'1'` or `'0'`, representing the binary digits of the input integer `x` from the least significant bit (rightmost) to the most significant bit (leftmost). The values of `length`, `nalla`, and `t` remain unchanged, with `length` being 30, `nalla` being 3, and `t` being greater than 3. `x` remains an input integer. `flag` is 0.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `flag` has been set to 0. All other variables (`s`, `length`, `nalla`, `t`, and `x`) retain their initial values.
