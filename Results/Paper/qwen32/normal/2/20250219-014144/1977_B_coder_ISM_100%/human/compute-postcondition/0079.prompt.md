Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is the input integer, `nalla` is not yet initialized, `length` is 30 if `flag` is 0 and `s[29]` is '0', or `length` is 31 if `flag` is not 0, `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 elements where each element is '1' if the corresponding bit of `x` is set, or '0' if the corresponding bit of `x` is not set, with '-1' replacing the first of any consecutive '1's and '0' replacing the second of those consecutive '1's, except `s[29]` which is '1' if `flag` is not 0, and the 31st element is '1' if `flag` is not 0, and `flag` is not 0 if the if condition is met. Additionally, either `flag` is not 0 or `s[29]` is not '0'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is the input integer, `nalla` is not yet initialized, `length` is 30 if `flag` is 0 and `s[29]` is '0', or `length` is 31 if `flag` is not 0, `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 elements where each element is '1' if the corresponding bit of `x` is set, or '0' if the corresponding bit of `x` is not set, with '-1' replacing the first of any consecutive '1's and '0' replacing the second of those consecutive '1's, except `s[29]` which is '1' if `flag` is not 0, and the 31st element is '1' if `flag` is not 0, `flag` is not 0 if the if condition is met, either `flag` is not 0 or `s[29]` is not '0'. If `s[i]` is '0' and `s[i - 1]` is '-1', then `s[i]` remains '0' and `s[i - 1]` remains '-1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is the input integer, `nalla` is not yet initialized, `length` is 30 if `flag` is 0 and `s[29]` is '0', or `length` is 31 if `flag` is not 0, `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 elements where each element is '1' if the corresponding bit of `x` is set, or '0' if the corresponding bit of `x` is not set, with '-1' replacing the first of any consecutive '1's and '0' replacing the second of those consecutive '1's, except `s[29]` which is '1' if `flag` is not 0, and the 31st element is '1' if `flag` is not 0. If `s[i]` was '-1' and `s[i - 1]` was '1', then `s[i-1]` is now '-1' and `s[i]` is '0'. `flag` is not 0 if the if condition is met, either `flag` is not 0 or `s[29]` is not '0'. `i` is `i_prev + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `x` is the input integer, `nalla` is not yet initialized, `length` is 30 if `flag` is 0 and `s[29]` is '0', or `length` is 31 if `flag` is not 0, `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 elements where each element is '1' if the corresponding bit of `x` is set, or '0' if the corresponding bit of `x` is not set, with '-1' replacing the first of any consecutive '1's and '0' replacing the second of those consecutive '1's, except `s[29]` which is '1' if `flag` is not 0, and the 31st element is '1' if `flag` is not 0, `flag` is not 0 if the if condition is met, either `flag` is not 0 or `s[29]` is not '0', `i` is `i_prev + 2`. If `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i - 1]` is '1', then `s[i]` is updated to '0'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
