The code snippet `s[i] = '1'` modifies the element at index `i` of the list `s` to be `'1'`. Given that `i` is 1, the second element of the list `s` (since indexing starts from 0) is set to `'1'`.

The other variables (`length`, `nalla`, `t`, `x`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **The list `s` contains 30 elements, each being either `'1'` or `'0'`, except possibly `s[0]` which could be `'-1'` if `flag` was 1 and `s[0]` was initially `'1'` and `s[1]` was `'1'`. Additionally, `s[1]` is now `'1'`. The variable `length` is 30, `nalla` is 3, `t` is greater than 3, `x` is an input integer, and `i` is 1.**
