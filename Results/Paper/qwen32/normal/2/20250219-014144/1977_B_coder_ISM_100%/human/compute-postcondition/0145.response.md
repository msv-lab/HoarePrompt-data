The code snippet `length += 1` increments the value of `length` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **The list `s` is modified according to the loop's rules, `flag` is 1, `s[29]` is now equal to '0', `s` has an additional element '1' appended to it, and `length` is incremented by 1.**
