Postcondition: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is the input integer, `nalla` is not yet initialized, `length` is 30, `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element is '1' if the corresponding bit of `x` is set, or '0' if the corresponding bit of `x` is not set. If `flag` was initially 0 and `s[i]` was '1' and `s[i+1]` was '1', then `s[1]` is '-1' and `flag` is 1. Otherwise, if `flag` was initially 1 and `s[1]` was '0', then `s[1]` is now '1'. `flag` is 0 or 1 depending on the conditions met, and `i` is 1.**
