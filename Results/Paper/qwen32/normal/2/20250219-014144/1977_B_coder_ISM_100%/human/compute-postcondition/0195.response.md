Postcondition: **The list `s` contains 30 elements, each being either `'1'` or `'0'`. The variable `length` is 30, `nalla` is 3, `t` is greater than 3, `x` is an input integer, `flag` is 0, and `i` is 0. Additionally, `flag` is not equal to 1, and either `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not equal to `'1'`.**
