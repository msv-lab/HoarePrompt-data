Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
Code of the loop:
for nalla in range(t):
    x = int(input())
    s = []
    length = 30
    for i in range(30):
        if x & pow(2, i):
            s.append('1')
        else:
            s.append('0')
    flag = 0
    for i in range(0, 29):
        if flag and s[i] == '0':
            s[i] = '1'
            flag = 0
        if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
            s[i] = '-1'
            flag = 1
        elif flag == 1:
            s[i] = '0'
        else:
            pass
    if flag and s[29] == '0':
        s[29] = '1'
    elif flag:
        s[29] = '0'
        s.append('1')
        length += 1
    for i in range(1, length):
        if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
            s[i] = '0'
            s[i - 1] = '-1'
    print(length)
    print(*s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is the input integer, `nalla` is not yet initialized, `length` is 30 if `flag` is 0 and `s[29]` is '0', or `length` is 31 if `flag` is not 0, `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 elements where each group of consecutive '1's in the binary representation of `x` is replaced by '-1' followed by '0's, `flag` is not 0 if the if condition is met, either `flag` is not 0 or `s[29]` is not '0'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The list `s` has all occurrences of `'1'` followed by `'-1'` transformed into `'0'` followed by `'-1'`. The variable `length` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The list `s` will have all instances of `'-1'` not immediately followed by `'1'`, with any `'1'`s appearing after `'0'`s or not at all, based on the initial transformations. The variables `length`, `nalla`, `t`, and `x` remain unchanged. If `flag` is `True` and `s[29]` is `'0'`, `s` has an extra element `'1'` at the end, and `length` is incremented by 1. If `flag` is `True` and `s[29]` is `'1'`, `s[29]` is also `'1'`. If `flag` is `False`, `s` remains as described in the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
