Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and y is 0. Additionally, there are x distinct integers provided in the second line of each test case, each representing a vertex chosen by Bessie and ranging from 1 to n. The sum of x across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
