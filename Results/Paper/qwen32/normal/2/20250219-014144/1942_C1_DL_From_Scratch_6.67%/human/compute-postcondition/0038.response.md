Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is `T - 1`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are new integers read from the input, `list0` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `num` is `list0[i] - list0[i - 1] - 1`, `count` is 1 if `num` is 1, otherwise `count` remains 0, `i` is `i + 1`.**
