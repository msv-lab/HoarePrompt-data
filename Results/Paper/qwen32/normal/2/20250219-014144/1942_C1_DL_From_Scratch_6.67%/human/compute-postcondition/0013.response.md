The given code snippet increments the value of `count` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input where `x` is greater than 1; `list0` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; if `num` is 1, then `count` was 1, otherwise `count` was 0; `num` is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `x` remains the same; `count` is now `count + 1`.**
