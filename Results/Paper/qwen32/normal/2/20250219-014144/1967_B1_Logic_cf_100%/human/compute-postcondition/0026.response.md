The given code snippet reads two space-separated values from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. This means the previous values of `n` and `m` are overwritten.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` are now the values read from the input.
- `ans` was previously calculated as `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))`, but since `n` and `m` have changed, `ans` would need to be recalculated with these new values. However, the code does not recalculate `ans` in this snippet.
- `T` was incremented by 1 (`T = T + 1`), and this increment remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are the values read from the input, `ans` is the previously calculated value and needs recalculating, `T` is incremented by 1.**
