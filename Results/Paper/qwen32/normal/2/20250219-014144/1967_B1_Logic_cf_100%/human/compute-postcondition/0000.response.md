`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they have not been assigned any values yet. The constraints on `t`, `n`, and `m` still hold.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2 · 10^6. The sum of `n` and the sum of `m` over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^6.**
