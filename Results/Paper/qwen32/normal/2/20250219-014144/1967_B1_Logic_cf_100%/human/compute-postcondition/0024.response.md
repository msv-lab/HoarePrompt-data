To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the formula used to compute `ans`.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t`: An input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This represents the number of test cases.
- `n` and `m`: Input integers.
- `ans`: Calculated as \( n + \sum_{b=2}^{\min(n, m)} \left(\frac{n + b}{b \cdot b}\right) \).
- `T`: Incremented by 1, but this variable is not used in the `print(ans)` statement.

### Calculation of `ans`:
The value of `ans` is computed as follows:
\[ \text{ans} = n + \sum_{b=2}^{\min(n, m)} \left(\frac{n + b}{b \cdot b}\right) \]

This means we start with `n` and add to it the sum of the expression \(\frac{n + b}{b \cdot b}\) for all integers `b` from 2 up to \(\min(n, m)\).

### Explanation:
- `n`: This is the first term in the calculation of `ans`.
- The summation part involves iterating over `b` from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\), and for each `b`, calculating \(\frac{n + b}{b \cdot b}\) and adding it to the running total.

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will output the computed value of `ans` based on the above formula.

Given that the exact values of `n` and `m` are not specified, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for `ans`. However, we can describe it precisely in terms of the given variables.

Output: **ans (where ans is calculated as \( n + \sum_{b=2}^{\min(n, m)} \left(\frac{n + b}{b \cdot b}\right) \))**
