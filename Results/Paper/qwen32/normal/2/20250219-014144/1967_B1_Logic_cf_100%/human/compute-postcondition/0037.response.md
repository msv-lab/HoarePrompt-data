Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers, `ans` is `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))` for each pair of `n` and `m` provided, `T` has completed all iterations up to `t`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations (from 1 to `t` times), the output state will have processed each pair of integers `n` and `m` provided as input. For each pair, it calculates the value of `ans` using the formula `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))` and prints it. The variable `T` will have taken on every integer value from 0 to `t-1`, ensuring all `t` test cases have been handled.
