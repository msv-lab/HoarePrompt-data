Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are the integer values read from the input, `ans` is now equal to `n`, `T` is incremented by 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `ans` has been updated to be equal to `n`. All other variables retain their previous states except for `ans`, which now holds the value of `n`. The variable `T` has been incremented by 1.
