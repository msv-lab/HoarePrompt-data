You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m`, computes a value based on these inputs using a specific formula, and prints the result. The computation involves summing a series derived from `n` and `m` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis:
The provided program is:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)
```

### Issues Identified:
1. **Initialization of `ans`**: The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`. This seems to assume that for each test case, there are initially `n` valid pairs, which is not necessarily true based on the problem description.
2. **Loop Range**: The loop iterates from `b = 2` to `min(n, m)`. This misses the case where `b = 1`, which should also be considered.
3. **Condition Check**: The condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is not directly checked in the loop. Instead, the program uses `(n + b) // (b * b)`, which does not guarantee the correct count of valid pairs.

### Potential Counterexample:
Let's consider a simple test case to check if the program works correctly:
- Input: `1 1`
- Expected Output: `1` (only pair is (1, 1))
- Program Output: `1` (correct for this specific case)

However, let's try another test case:
- Input: `2 2`
- Expected Output: `3` (pairs are (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2))
- Program Output: `2` (incorrect)

### Explanation:
The program does not correctly account for all valid pairs. Specifically, it misses pairs where `b = 1` and does not properly check the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle all cases correctly, particularly missing the case where `b = 1` and not properly checking the condition for other values of `b`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**.
