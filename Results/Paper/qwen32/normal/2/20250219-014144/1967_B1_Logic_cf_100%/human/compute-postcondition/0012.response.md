To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` are integers.
- `ans` is calculated as `n + Σ((n + b) // (b * b)) for b from 2 to min(n, m)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Explanation:
The variable `ans` is computed using a formula that involves `n`, `m`, and a summation over `b` ranging from 2 to `min(n, m)`. The summation term `(n + b) // (b * b)` is an integer division operation, meaning it divides `(n + b)` by `(b * b)` and takes the floor of the result.

Let's express `ans` more precisely:

\[ \text{ans} = n + \sum_{b=2}^{\min(n, m)} \left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b^2} \right\rfloor \]

Where:
- `n` is an integer.
- `m` is an integer.
- The summation runs from `b = 2` to `b = \min(n, m)`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe the output in terms of `n` and `m`.

### Final Output Description:
The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`, which is calculated as `n` plus the sum of the integer divisions `(n + b) // (b * b)` for `b` ranging from 2 to `min(n, m)`.

Output: **ans (where ans is calculated as n + Σ((n + b) // (b * b)) for b from 2 to min(n, m))**
