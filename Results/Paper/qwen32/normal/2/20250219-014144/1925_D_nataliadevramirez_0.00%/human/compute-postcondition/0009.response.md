Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `t` must be at least 1 and is decremented by 1, `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists where each sublist contains three integers representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**

Explanation: The variable `result` is updated to hold the return value of the function `func_1` when called with the arguments `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `t`, and `friendships`) retain their initial values as they are not modified by the given code snippet.
