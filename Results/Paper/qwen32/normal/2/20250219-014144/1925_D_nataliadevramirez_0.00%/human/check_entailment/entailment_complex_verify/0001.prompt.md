You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of children, m is an integer representing the number of pairs of friends, k is an integer representing the number of excursions, and friendships is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (a, b, f) representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value. It is assumed that 2 <= n <= 10^5, 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2), 1 <= k <= 2*10^5, and for each tuple (a, b, f) in friendships, 1 <= a, b <= n, a != b, and 1 <= f <= 10^9.
def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
    result = 0
    for i in range(m):
        a, b, f = friendships[i]
        
        result += f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD
        
    #State: result is the accumulated sum of (f * (k * (k + 1) // 2)) % MOD for all m friendships.
    return result % MOD
    #The program returns the value of `result % MOD`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the accumulated sum of a specific formula applied to each friendship, modulo `MOD`. The formula for each friendship is the product of the friendship's initial value and the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, all taken modulo `MOD`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of children such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, m is an integer representing the number of pairs of friends such that 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2), k is an integer representing the number of excursions such that 1 <= k <= 2*10^5, and friendships is a list of lists where each sublist contains three integers a_i, b_i, f_i representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value such that a_i != b_i, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9.

        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` are the values from the last iteration, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)` from the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of children, the number of pairs of friends, the number of excursions, and the initial friendship values between pairs of friends. For each test case, it computes and prints the final friendship values after considering all excursions.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for the excursions, considering that the friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time that pair is chosen. The final result should be expressed as \( \frac{p}{q} \) where \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime integers, and we need to output \( p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) \).

### Key Points:
1. **Friendship Value Increase**: For each pair of friends, their friendship value increases by 1 every time they are chosen.
2. **Expected Value Calculation**: The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all chosen pairs needs to be calculated.
3. **Modulo Operation**: The result should be given modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Code Analysis:
The code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1`: This function calculates the result for a single test case.
2. `func_2`: This function reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Input Parameters**: `n` (number of children), `m` (number of pairs of friends), `k` (number of excursions), and `friendships` (list of friendship details).
- **Logic**:
  - The code iterates over each friendship.
  - For each friendship, it calculates the contribution to the result using the formula `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`.
  - The term `k * (k + 1) // 2` represents the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is the expected sum of friendship values for a pair if it is chosen `k` times.
  - The result is accumulated and returned modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Input Reading**: Reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
- **Processing**: Calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the result.

### Correctness Check:
- **Formula Used**: The formula `k * (k + 1) // 2` is correct for calculating the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which represents the expected sum of friendship values for a pair if it is chosen `k` times.
- **Modulo Operation**: The result is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) as required.
- **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The code correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the input and processing each test case independently.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as per the given requirements and constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
