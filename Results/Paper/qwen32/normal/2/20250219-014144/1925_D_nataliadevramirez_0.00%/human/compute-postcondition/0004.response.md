To determine the output state, we need to consider the function call `result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`. Since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we can only infer that `result` will be assigned whatever value `func_1` returns when called with the given arguments.

Given the initial state and the function call, the only variable that changes is `result`, which is assigned the return value of `func_1`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `t` must be at least 1, `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists where each sublist contains three integers representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**.
