### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several critical issues with the provided program. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions. This involves considering the probability of choosing each pair of friends in each excursion.
   - The probability of choosing a specific pair of friends in one excursion is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\), where \(\binom{n}{2}\) is the total number of possible pairs of children, calculated as \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
   - The expected number of times a specific pair is chosen in `k` excursions is \(k \times \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - Given that the friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time it is chosen, the expected contribution of a friendship with initial value `f` is \(f \times k \times \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \times \frac{k + 1}{2}\).

2. **Current Implementation**:
   - The provided code calculates the contribution of each friendship using the formula `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`. This formula assumes that each pair of friends is chosen `k` times, which is incorrect because it does not account for the probability of choosing each pair.
   - The code does not consider the probability of selecting each pair, leading to an incorrect calculation of the expected value.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - While the modulo operation is applied at the end of the summation, it is generally a good practice to apply modulo operations during the summation process to prevent overflow, especially when dealing with large numbers.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions. The original assessment accurately identifies these issues and concludes that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
