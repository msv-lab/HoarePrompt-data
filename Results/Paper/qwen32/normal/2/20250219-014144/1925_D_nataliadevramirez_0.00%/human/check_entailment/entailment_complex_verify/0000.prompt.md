You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of children, m is an integer representing the number of pairs of friends, k is an integer representing the number of excursions, and friendships is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (a, b, f) representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value. It is assumed that 2 <= n <= 10^5, 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2), 1 <= k <= 2*10^5, and for each tuple (a, b, f) in friendships, 1 <= a, b <= n, a != b, and 1 <= f <= 10^9.
def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
    result = 0
    for i in range(m):
        a, b, f = friendships[i]
        
        result += f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD
        
    #State: result is the accumulated sum of (f * (k * (k + 1) // 2)) % MOD for all m friendships.
    return result % MOD
    #The program returns the value of `result % MOD`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the accumulated sum of a specific formula applied to each friendship, modulo `MOD`. The formula for each friendship is the product of the friendship's initial value and the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, all taken modulo `MOD`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of children such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, m is an integer representing the number of pairs of friends such that 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2), k is an integer representing the number of excursions such that 1 <= k <= 2*10^5, and friendships is a list of lists where each sublist contains three integers a_i, b_i, f_i representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value such that a_i != b_i, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9.

        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` are the values from the last iteration, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)` from the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of children, the number of pairs of friends, the number of excursions, and the initial friendship values between pairs of friends. For each test case, it computes and prints the final friendship values after considering all excursions.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of friendships.
2. **Friendship Value Calculation**: For each friendship, the program calculates the contribution to the total sum of friendship values using the formula `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`.
3. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Expected Value Calculation**: The problem asks for the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions. The current implementation calculates the sum of friendship values assuming that each pair of friends is chosen `k` times, which is incorrect. The correct approach involves calculating the probability of choosing each pair and then computing the expected value.
2. **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation is applied only after the summation of all contributions, which might lead to overflow issues before applying the modulo. However, since the problem guarantees that the sum of `k` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\), this issue might not arise in practice, but it's still a good practice to apply modulo operations during the summation process.
3. **Distinct Pairs**: The problem states that all pairs of friends are distinct, which is handled correctly in the input reading part.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly calculate the expected value, we need to consider the probability of choosing each pair of friends in each excursion. Since each pair is chosen equiprobably and independently, the probability of choosing a specific pair in one excursion is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\), where \(\binom{n}{2}\) is the total number of possible pairs. The expected number of times a specific pair is chosen in `k` excursions is \(k \times \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\).

The expected contribution of a friendship with initial value `f` is then \(f \times k \times \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \times \frac{k + 1}{2}\).

However, the provided code does not account for these probabilities and instead assumes that each pair is chosen `k` times, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program incorrectly calculates the sum of friendship values by assuming each pair is chosen `k` times, rather than considering the probability of choosing each pair in each excursion. This leads to an incorrect calculation of the expected value.
