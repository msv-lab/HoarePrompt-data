Output State: **`t` is 0, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` are the values from the last iteration, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)` from the last iteration.**

Natural Language Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop. Additionally, `result` will contain the return value of the function `func_1` from the last iteration of the loop. All other variables that were part of the initial state and not modified within the loop remain unchanged.
