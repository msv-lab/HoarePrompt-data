To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement:

1. **Variables and Inputs:**
   - `n`: An integer read from input, representing the number of people.
   - `m`: An integer read from input, representing the number of friendships.
   - `k`: An integer read from input, likely used in some calculations within `func_1`.
   - `t`: Must be at least 2 and is decremented by 1. This implies `t` starts at 2 or more and becomes 1 after decrementing.
   - `friendships`: A list of `m` sublists, where each sublist contains three integers: two integers representing a pair of friends and one integer representing their initial friendship value.

2. **Function Call:**
   - `result`: The return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`. The function `func_1` presumably performs some operations using the provided inputs and returns a result.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - `print(result)`: This statement will print the value of `result`.

Given this information, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `result` without knowing the specific implementation of `func_1` and the exact input values (`n`, `m`, `k`, and the contents of `friendships`). However, we can describe the output in terms of what it represents.

### Explanation:
- The `result` variable holds the output of the function `func_1`, which processes the inputs `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` and returns a value.
- Since the exact behavior of `func_1` is not specified, we can only say that `result` is whatever value `func_1` computes based on the given inputs.

### Final Output:
Output: **result (where result is the return value of func_1(n, m, k, friendships))**
