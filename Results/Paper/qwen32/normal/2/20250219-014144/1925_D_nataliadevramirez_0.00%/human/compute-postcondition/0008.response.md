The given code snippet reads `m` lines of input, each containing three integers, and assigns these lines to the `friendships` list. This means that the `friendships` list will now contain `m` sublists, each with three integers.

Since the code does not modify `n`, `m`, `k`, or `t`, these variables retain their initial values. The `result` variable, which holds the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`, is also unaffected by this code snippet because the function call has not been executed yet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `t` must be at least 1 and is decremented by 1, `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists where each sublist contains three integers representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**

In simpler terms, the `friendships` list is now populated with `m` sublists of three integers each, while all other variables remain unchanged.
