n is an integer representing the number of children, m is an integer representing the number of pairs of friends, k is an integer representing the number of excursions, and friendships is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (a, b, f) representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value. It is assumed that 2 <= n <= 10^5, 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2), 1 <= k <= 2*10^5, and for each tuple (a, b, f) in friendships, 1 <= a, b <= n, a != b, and 1 <= f <= 10^9.
