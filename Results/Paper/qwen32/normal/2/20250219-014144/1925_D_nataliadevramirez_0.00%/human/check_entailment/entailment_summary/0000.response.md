### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the solution is correct.

#### Problem Analysis:
We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The expected value can be computed by summing up the contributions of each friendship pair over all excursions.

For each friendship pair (a, b) with an initial friendship value \( f \), the contribution to the total sum over k excursions is:
\[ f \times \left( \sum_{i=1}^{k} i \right) \]

The sum of the first k natural numbers is given by:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{k} i = \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2} \]

Thus, the contribution of each friendship pair (a, b) is:
\[ f \times \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2} \]

Since the problem requires the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \), we need to ensure that all calculations respect this modulus.

#### Code Analysis:
The code consists of two functions:
1. **func_1**: This function takes the number of children `n`, the number of pairs of friends `m`, the number of excursions `k`, and a list of friendships. It calculates the accumulated sum of the contributions of each friendship pair over all excursions, taking the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
2. **func_2**: This function reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the result for each test case.

#### Verification:
- **func_1**: The implementation correctly calculates the contribution of each friendship pair using the formula \( f \times \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2} \) and sums these contributions modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
- **func_2**: This function correctly reads the input for each test case, calls `func_1` to compute the result, and prints the result.

Both functions work together to solve the problem as described. The logic and the implementation match the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
