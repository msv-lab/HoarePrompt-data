Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n`, the number of children (an integer between 2 and 10^5); `m`, the number of pairs of friends (an integer between 0 and the minimum of 10^5 and n*(n-1)/2); `k`, the number of excursions (an integer between 1 and 2*10^5); and `friendships`, a list of lists where each sublist contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value (with `a_i` and `b_i` being distinct integers between 1 and n, and `f_i` being an integer between 1 and 10^9). The function returns the final friendship values after all excursions have been considered.**
