The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use) and `t`. Since `_` is not used within the loop head, the only variable we can adjust is `t`.

Given that `t` must be at least 1 and is decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be at least 2 at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` is decremented by 1 from its current value.

State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `t` must be at least 2 and is decremented by 1, `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists where each sublist contains three integers representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**
