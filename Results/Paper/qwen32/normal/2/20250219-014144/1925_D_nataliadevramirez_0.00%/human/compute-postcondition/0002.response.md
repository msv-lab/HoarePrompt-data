The given code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This means that the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` will be updated based on the input provided.

Given the initial state, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` will be replaced by the new values read from the input. The other variables (`friendships`, `t`) remain unchanged unless they are modified later in the code (which is not shown here).

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `friendships` is a list of lists where each sublist contains three integers a_i, b_i, f_i representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value such that a_i != b_i, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9, and `t` must be at least 1.**
