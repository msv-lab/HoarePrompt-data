### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and the provided solution to ensure its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for the excursions.
- Each time a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1.
- The result should be expressed as \( \frac{p}{q} \) where \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime integers, and we need to output \( p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) \).

#### Key Points:
1. **Friendship Value Increase**: For each pair of friends, their friendship value increases by 1 every time they are chosen.
2. **Expected Value Calculation**: The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all chosen pairs needs to be calculated.
3. **Modulo Operation**: The result should be given modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

#### Code Analysis:
The code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1`: This function calculates the result for a single test case.
2. `func_2`: This function reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Input Parameters**: `n` (number of children), `m` (number of pairs of friends), `k` (number of excursions), and `friendships` (list of friendship details).
- **Logic**:
  - The code iterates over each friendship.
  - For each friendship, it calculates the contribution to the result using the formula `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`.
  - The term `k * (k + 1) // 2` represents the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is the expected sum of friendship values for a pair if it is chosen `k` times.
  - The result is accumulated and returned modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Input Reading**: Reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
- **Processing**: Calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the result.

### Correctness Check:
- **Formula Used**: The formula `k * (k + 1) // 2` is correct for calculating the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which represents the expected sum of friendship values for a pair if it is chosen `k` times.
- **Modulo Operation**: The result is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) as required.
- **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The code correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the input and processing each test case independently.

### Potential Issues:
- **Probability Consideration**: The current implementation assumes that each pair of friends will be chosen exactly `k` times on average. However, the problem specifies that each pair is chosen equiprobably and independently. This means that the probability of choosing any specific pair in a single excursion is \( \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \), where \( \binom{n}{2} \) is the total number of possible pairs.
- **Expected Value Calculation**: The expected value for each pair should consider the probability of being chosen in each excursion. The correct expected value for a pair being chosen in `k` excursions is \( k \times \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \). The expected increase in friendship value for a pair is then \( k \times \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \times (k + 1) / 2 \).

Given these considerations, the current implementation does not correctly account for the probability of choosing each pair, leading to an incorrect calculation of the expected value.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as per the given requirements and constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
