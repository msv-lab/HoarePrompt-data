Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index `i` to the end of `a`, `check_all_new` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to each element in `new`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`, `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all` remain unchanged, except that we exit the current loop or if statement.
