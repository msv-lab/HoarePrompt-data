To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is greater than or equal to 2
- `n` is greater than 1
- `a` is a list of integers
- Depending on the condition `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, `check_all` might be set to False
- `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]` (if `check_all` was set to False)
- `new` (a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end of the list) is checked
- `check_all_new` and `new_all` determine if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]` and non-decreasing
- If `a[i - 1] <= a[i]`, `check_all` retains its original value

The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, so for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

- Since `i` was 1 at the start of the previous iteration and it was incremented to 2 at the end, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2 + 1 = 3.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 3**.

Note that `check_all`, `a[i - 1]`, `a[i]`, `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted here. Their values depend on the specific logic inside the loop body, which is omitted.
