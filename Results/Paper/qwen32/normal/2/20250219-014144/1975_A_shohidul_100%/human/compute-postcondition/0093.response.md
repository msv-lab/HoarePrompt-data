Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is False because `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `_` is 1, `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index `i` to the end of `a`, `check_all_new` is True, `new_all` is True, and all elements in `new` are non-decreasing while `a[0]` is greater than or equal to each element in `new`.**
