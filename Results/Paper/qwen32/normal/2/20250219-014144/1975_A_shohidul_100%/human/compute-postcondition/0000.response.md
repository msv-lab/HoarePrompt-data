Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50) representing the length of the array `a`, followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6) representing the elements of the array `a`. There are `t` such test cases.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the input integer, which represents the number of test cases. The other variables (`n`, `a`) remain unchanged as they have not been initialized or modified in the given code snippet.
