Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than or equal to 2; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is True if `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order up to the `n-1` elements, otherwise False.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all_new and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, then `check_all` is set to False, `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, and `new` (a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end of the list) is checked. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both True, all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]` and non-decreasing. Otherwise, either `check_all_new` is False or `new_all` is False, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `a[i - 1] <= a[i]`, `check_all` retains its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 3. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index 3 to the end, `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement regardless of the condition being true or false. Otherwise, no additional changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than 4, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 4. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index 4 to the end, `check_all_new` indicates whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, and `new_all` indicates whether all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order. Regardless of the values of `check_all_new` and `new_all`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i - 1] <= a[i]`, no additional changes are made to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
