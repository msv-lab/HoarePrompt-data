Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `_` is 1. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, then `check_all` is False, indicating that `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order up to the `n-1` elements. If `a[i - 1] <= a[i]`, then `check_all` retains its original value. If `check_all` becomes False due to `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, a new list `new` is created from index `i` to the end of `a`, and additional checks (`check_all_new` and `new_all`) determine if `new` is non-decreasing and if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to each element in `new`. If either `check_all_new` or `new_all` is False, the loop or if statement breaks.**
