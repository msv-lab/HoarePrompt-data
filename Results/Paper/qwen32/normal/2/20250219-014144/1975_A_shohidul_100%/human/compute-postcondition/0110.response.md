Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index `i` to the end of `a`, `check_all_new` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to each element in `new`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`, and `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`. Regardless of whether `check_all_new` and `new_all` are `True` or `False`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
