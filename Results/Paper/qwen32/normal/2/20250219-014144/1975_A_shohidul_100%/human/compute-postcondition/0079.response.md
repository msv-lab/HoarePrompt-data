Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than 4, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 4, `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index 4 to the end, `check_all_new` indicates whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, and `new_all` indicates whether all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement regardless of whether `check_all_new` and `new_all` are true or false.**
