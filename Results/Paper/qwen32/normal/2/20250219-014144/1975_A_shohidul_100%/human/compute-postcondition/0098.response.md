Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is False because `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `_` is 1, `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index `i` to the end of `a`. Either `check_all_new` is False, or `new_all` is False, or both, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables remain unchanged except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
