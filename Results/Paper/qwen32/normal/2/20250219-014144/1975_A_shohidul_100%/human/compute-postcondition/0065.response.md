Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `i` is set to 3.
- `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index 3 to the end.
- `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`.
- `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The provided code snippet contains only a single `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `new`, `check_all_new`, `new_all`) mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
Output: **YES**
