Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's analyze the situation:

- `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `check_all` is `False`.
- At the current index `i`, `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`.
- `new` is a list containing elements from `a[i:]`.
- `check_all_new` is `True`.
- `new_all` is `True`.

The provided code snippet is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

This print statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It directly prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **YES**
