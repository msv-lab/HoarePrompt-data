The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides various conditions and variable definitions, but none of these affect the content of the `print` statement itself. The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or their values described in the initial state.

Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `check_all` is False because `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`.
- `_` is 1.
- `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index `i` to the end of `a`.
- Either `check_all_new` is False, or `new_all` is False, or both.

None of these variables or conditions influence the `print` statement, which simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **NO**
