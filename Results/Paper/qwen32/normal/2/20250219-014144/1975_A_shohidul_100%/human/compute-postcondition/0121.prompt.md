Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than or equal to 2; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is True if `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order up to the `n-1` elements, otherwise False; `_` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all_new and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `_` is 1. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, then `check_all` is False, indicating that `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order up to the `n-1` elements. If `a[i - 1] <= a[i]`, then `check_all` retains its original value. If `check_all` becomes False due to `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, a new list `new` is created from index `i` to the end of `a`, and additional checks (`check_all_new` and `new_all`) determine if `new` is non-decreasing and if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to each element in `new`. If either `check_all_new` or `new_all` is False, the loop or if statement breaks.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index `i` to the end of `a`, `check_all_new` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to each element in `new`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`, and `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`. Regardless of whether `check_all_new` and `new_all` are `True` or `False`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, then `new` is a list containing elements from index `i` to the end of `a`, `check_all_new` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`, `new_all` is `True` if each element in `new` is less than or equal to the next element in `new`, otherwise `new_all` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement regardless of whether `check_all_new and new_all` is `True` or `False`. If `a[i - 1] <= a[i]`, no additional changes are made to the variables `new`, `check_all_new`, or `new_all`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
