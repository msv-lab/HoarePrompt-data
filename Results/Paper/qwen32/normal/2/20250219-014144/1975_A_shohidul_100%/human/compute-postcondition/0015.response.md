Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is `False`; at the current index `i`, the element `a[i - 1]` is greater than the element `a[i]`; `new` is a list containing elements from `a[i:]`; `check_all_new` is `True` and `new_all` is `True`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the only action taken is to break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
