The code snippet creates a new list `new` which contains elements from index `i` to the end of the list `a`. Given that `i` is 4, `new` will contain all elements of `a` starting from the 5th element (index 4) to the last element.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is `False`; `i` is 4; `new` is a list containing elements from index 4 to the end of `a`.**
