Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `less` contains the integer `a` if `x` was 2, `big` contains the integer `a` if `x` was 1, `no` contains the integer `a` if `x` was neither 1 nor 2 and also contains the new integer `a` if `x` was not 2, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, and `iterable2` is incremented by 1.**
