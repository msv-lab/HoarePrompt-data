The given code appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. Since `a` is specified to be one of the integers 1, 2, or 3, and `no` was initially an empty list, after the operation, `no` will contain exactly one element, which is the value of `a`.

Here is the updated state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, there are `n-1` lines remaining containing two integers `a` and `x` where `a` ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `loop` is greater than 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing the value of `a`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, `x` is not equal to 1, and `x` is not equal to 2.**
