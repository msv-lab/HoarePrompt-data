The code snippet `no = []` reassigns the list `no` to an empty list. This means that any previous contents of `no` are discarded.

Given the initial state, `no` originally contained all integers `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2. After executing the code, `no` is now an empty list.

The values of `t`, `n`, `less`, `big`, and `iterable` remain unchanged. The value of `num` depends on the current state of `less`, `big`, and `no`. Since `no` has been reset to an empty list, the calculation of `num` will now only consider the elements in `less` and `big`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `less` is [], `big` is [], `no` is [], `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1` (since `no` is now empty, the count of elements in `no` that are between `max(big)` and `min(less)` inclusive is 0), `iterable` is `iterable + 1`.**
