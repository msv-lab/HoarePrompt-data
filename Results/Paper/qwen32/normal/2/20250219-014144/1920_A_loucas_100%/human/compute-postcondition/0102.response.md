The code snippet provided resets the list `big` to an empty list. This affects the variable `big` only, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `less` is [], `big` is [], `no` contains all integers `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, and `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1` minus the count of elements in `no` that are between `max(big)` and `min(less)` inclusive, `iterable` is `iterable + 1`.**
