### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided code and verify whether it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it initializes three lists: `less`, `big`, and `no`. These lists will store the values from constraints of types 2, 1, and 3, respectively.

2. **Reading Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, the program reads the type `a` and the value `x`.
   - Depending on the type `a`, it appends `x` to the appropriate list (`less` for type 2, `big` for type 1, and `no` for type 3).

3. **Calculating the Range**:
   - The program calculates the potential range of valid `k` values using `min(less)` and `max(big)`. This gives the smallest upper bound and the largest lower bound among the constraints.
   - The number of integers `k` that could potentially satisfy the constraints is calculated as `num = min(less) - max(big) + 1`.

4. **Adjusting for "Not Equal" Constraints**:
   - If `num` is less than 1, it means there are no integers that can satisfy the constraints, so it prints `0` and moves to the next test case.
   - Otherwise, it iterates through the `no` list and subtracts 1 from `num` for each value in `no` that falls within the range `[max(big), min(less)]`.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the adjusted `num` for each test case.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the code with the first example provided:

**Input:**
```
4
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
```

- **Constraints**:
  - `k >= 3`
  - `k <= 10`
  - `k != 1`
  - `k != 5`

- **Processing**:
  - `big = [3]`
  - `less = [10]`
  - `no = [1, 5]`
  - `num = min(less) - max(big) + 1 = 10 - 3 + 1 = 8`
  - Adjusting for `no`:
    - `1` is not in the range `[3, 10]`, so `num` remains `8`.
    - `5` is in the range `[3, 10]`, so `num` becomes `8 - 1 = 7`.

- **Output**:
  - `7` (which matches the expected output)

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly processes the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case. It handles all the edge cases mentioned in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
