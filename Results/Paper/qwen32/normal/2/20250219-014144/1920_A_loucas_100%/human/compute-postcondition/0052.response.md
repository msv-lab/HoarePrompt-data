The given code snippet sets the `big` list to an empty list. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `less`, `no`, `num`, `innerLoop`, or `iterable`. Therefore, the only change is that `big` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1` minus the count of elements in `no` that are between `max(big)` and `min(less)` inclusive, and `innerLoop` is the length of the list `no`, `iterable` is incremented by 1.**
