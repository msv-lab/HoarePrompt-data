The code snippet `big.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. No other variables are modified by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `less` is []
- `big` is []
- `no` is []
- `num` is 0
- `iterable` is `iterable + 1` (This seems incorrect as `iterable` should have a specific value or be defined. Assuming it was meant to be an integer and is unchanged.)
- `innerLoop` is greater than 0
- `x` is 1
- `a` is the second integer from the input

After executing `big.append(a)`, the list `big` now contains the value of `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `less` is [], `big` is [a], `no` is [], `num` is 0, `iterable` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is 1, `a` is the second integer from the input.**
