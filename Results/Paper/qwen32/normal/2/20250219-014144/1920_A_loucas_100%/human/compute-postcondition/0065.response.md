Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `less` is a list containing the single element `a` if `x` is 2, otherwise `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing the integer `a` if `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, otherwise `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the input and is not equal to 1, `a` is the second integer from the input.**
