Output State: **`ans1` is a list containing the element `b[n - 1]`; `ans2` is an empty list; `k` is twice the second integer from the input; `i` is `len(l) - 1`; `q` is incremented by 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is a sorted list containing elements of `a` from index `n` to the end; `req` is twice the second integer from the input; if `b[0] != b[1]`, then `l` is a list containing the first element of `b`; otherwise, `l` remains an empty list.**

Natural Language Explanation: The list `ans1` now contains the element at index `n-1` from the sorted list `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
