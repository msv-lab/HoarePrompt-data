The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. This operation does not affect the previously defined variables `ans1`, `ans2`, `k`, `i`, `q`, or `n`.

Output State: **`ans1` and `ans2` each contain all elements of `l`; `k` is the second integer from the input; `i` is `len(l) - 1`; `q` is incremented by 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
