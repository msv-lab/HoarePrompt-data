The code snippet `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `b` to the list `ans1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 2.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`.
- `c` is a sorted list containing elements of `a` from index `n` to the end.
- `req` is twice the second integer from the input.
- If `b[0] != b[1]`, then `l` is a list containing the first element of `b`; otherwise, `l` remains an empty list.
- `i` is `len(l) - 1`.
- `ans1` is an empty list if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, otherwise `ans1` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `b[n - 1]`.
- `ans2` is always an empty list.
- `k` is 0 if the initial `k` was 0; otherwise, `k` retains its original value.
- `q` is incremented by 1.
- Additionally, `b[i] == b[i - 1]` is true, meaning the last two elements of `b` are equal.

Since `b[i] == b[i - 1]` and `i` is `len(l) - 1`, and considering the conditions for `ans1`:
- If `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, `ans1` is initially an empty list. After appending `b[i]`, `ans1` will contain one element, which is `b[i]`.
- If `b[n - 2] == b[n - 1]`, `ans1` is initially a list containing two elements, both equal to `b[n - 1]`. After appending `b[i]`, `ans1` will contain three elements, all equal to `b[n - 1]`.

Since `b[i] == b[i - 1]` and `b[n - 2] == b[n - 1]` (given the additional condition), `ans1` will have three elements, all equal to `b[n - 1]`.

Thus, the updated state is:
Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 2; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is a sorted list containing elements of `a` from index `n` to the end; `req` is twice the second integer from the input; if `b[0] != b[1]`, then `l` is a list containing the first element of `b`; otherwise, `l` remains an empty list; `i` is `len(l) - 1`; `ans1` is a list containing three elements, all equal to `b[n - 1]`; `ans2` is always an empty list; `k` is 0 if the initial `k` was 0; otherwise, `k` retains its original value; `q` is incremented by 1.**
