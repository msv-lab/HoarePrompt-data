Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans2` contains all pairs of consecutive duplicates from `c` until `k` becomes zero or the loop completes, `k` is reduced by 2 for each pair added to `ans2`, and `i` is `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking early.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(l)):
    if k == 0:
        break
    ans1.append(l[i])
    ans2.append(l[i])
    k -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `l` is a non-empty list, `k` is decreased by 1, `ans1` contains the additional element `l[i]`, `ans2` contains the additional element `l[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans1` includes `l[i]` as its last element, `ans2` includes `l[i]` as its last element, and `k` is decreased by 1. If `k` is now 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is incremented by 1 and `i` is less than the length of `l`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the execution continues without breaking. `ans1` includes the element `l[i]` from the list `l`. `ans2` includes the element `l[i]` from the list `l`. `k` is decreased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
