To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is just `i`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `l` is a non-empty list.
- `k` is decreased by 1 (though `k` is not part of the loop head and thus does not need adjustment).
- `ans1` and `ans2` each contain an additional element `l[i]` (these are also not part of the loop head and thus do not need adjustment).

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(len(l)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From this, we know that `i` is the loop variable and it iterates over the indices of the list `l`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken on a value such that `l[i]` was processed. For the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `x`. This means that `l[x]` was processed, and now `i` should be `x + 1` for the next iteration.

Since we don't have the exact value of `x`, we can generalize that if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

However, we can infer that `i` must be incremented by 1 from its previous value. Therefore, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this increment.

State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is incremented by 1**. 

Since `k` and the contents of `ans1` and `ans2` are not part of the loop head, they remain unchanged and do not need to be specified in the state for the next iteration of the loop.

Final Answer:
State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is incremented by 1**.
