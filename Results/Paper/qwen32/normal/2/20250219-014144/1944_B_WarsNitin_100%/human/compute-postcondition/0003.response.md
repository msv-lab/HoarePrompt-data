The code reads a line of input, splits it into components based on spaces, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 5000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
