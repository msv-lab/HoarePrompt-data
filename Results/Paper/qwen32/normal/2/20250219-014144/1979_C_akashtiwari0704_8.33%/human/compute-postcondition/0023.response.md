Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `T` is 0, `bets` is unchanged, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the product of the original first `bets` elements of `a`, `sumo` is the sum of the updated values of `a[i]` for `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, and `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.**
