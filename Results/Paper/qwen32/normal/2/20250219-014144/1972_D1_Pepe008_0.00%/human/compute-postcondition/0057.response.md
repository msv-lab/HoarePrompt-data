The code snippet `suma += x` increments the variable `suma` by the value of `x`. Given the initial state, `i` remains unchanged at 4, `b` remains at least 1, and `x` is calculated as `(a - 12) // 16 + 1`. After executing the code, `suma` will be updated to its previous value plus `x`.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `b` must be at least 1, `x` is `(a - 12) // 16 + 1`, `suma` is `suma + (a - 12) // 16 + 1`**.
