To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze it step-by-step against the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Provided Code Analysis:
The code attempts to solve this problem using a loop and some mathematical operations. Let's break down the key parts of the code:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (n, m) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, m + 1):  # Loop over possible values of b
            x = (n - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if n - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        print(suma - 1)
```

#### Key Points:
1. **Loop Over `b`**: The outer loop iterates over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m`.
2. **Calculation of `x`**: For each `b`, it calculates `x` as `(n - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. This seems to be an attempt to count the number of valid `a` for each `b`.
3. **Condition Check**: It checks if `n - i * (i - 1) > 0` before adding `x` to `suma`.
4. **Final Output**: Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

### Issues with the Code:
1. **Incorrect Formula**: The formula used to calculate `x` does not correctly determine the number of valid `a` for each `b`. The condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is not directly translated into the formula used.
2. **Logic Error**: The logic for counting valid pairs `(a, b)` seems flawed. The provided formula does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checking the condition directly. However, due to the constraints (`n, m` up to \(2 \times 10^6\)), a direct approach might be inefficient. Instead, we need a more optimized method, possibly involving mathematical insights or precomputation.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as per the given requirements and constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
