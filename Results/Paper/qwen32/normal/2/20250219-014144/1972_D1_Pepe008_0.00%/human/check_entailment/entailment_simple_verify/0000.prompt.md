You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        'for i in range(1,a+1):\n        for j in range(4,b+1):\n            if int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0:\n                print(i,j)'
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        print(suma - 1)

    #State: `t` is equal to `T`, `T` is the number of test cases, `info` is the list of strings from the last input line, `a` and `b` are the integer values from the last input line, `suma` is the accumulated sum of `x` for the last test case where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, and the final printed value is `suma - 1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve this problem using a different approach than brute force. Here's the code again for reference:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        print(suma - 1)

func()
```

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Formula**: The formula used in the program `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` does not correctly represent the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
2. **Logic Error**: The logic in the loop does not properly account for all possible pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when \(a\) or \(b\) are small values.

### Verification with Test Cases:
Let's verify the program with the provided example inputs:

#### Test Case 1:
Input:
```
1
1 1
```
Expected Output:
```
1
```
The program outputs `0`, which is incorrect.

#### Test Case 2:
Input:
```
1
2 3
```
Expected Output:
```
3
```
The program outputs `1`, which is incorrect.

#### Test Case 3:
Input:
```
1
3 5
```
Expected Output:
```
4
```
The program outputs `1`, which is incorrect.

#### Test Case 4:
Input:
```
1
10 8
```
Expected Output:
```
14
```
The program outputs `1`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and verification with test cases, the program does not correctly implement the required logic to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program uses an incorrect formula and logic to count the valid pairs. It fails to correctly handle the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The output for multiple test cases does not match the expected results, indicating that the program does not meet the problem requirements.
