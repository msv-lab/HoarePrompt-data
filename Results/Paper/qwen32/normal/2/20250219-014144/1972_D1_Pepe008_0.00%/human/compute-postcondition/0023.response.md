The code snippet provided assigns the integer value of `info[0]` to `a` and the integer value of `info[1]` to `b`. No other variables are modified by this code.

Given the initial state, the only changes are the assignments to `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`, `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during the iterations where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.**
