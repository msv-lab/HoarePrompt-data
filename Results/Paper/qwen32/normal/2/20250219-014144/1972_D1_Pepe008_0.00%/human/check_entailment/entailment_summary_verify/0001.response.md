### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the logical errors in the provided code and explains why the current implementation does not solve the problem as described. Here's a detailed breakdown:

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Condition Analysis Recap:
The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) simplifies to \(a\) being a multiple of \(b\). Specifically, for each \(b\), the number of valid \(a\) values is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{b} \right\rfloor\).

#### Provided Code Analysis Recap:
The provided code attempts to compute the number of valid pairs using a formula that does not correctly count the multiples of \(b\) up to \(n\). The code snippet:
```python
suma = 0
for i in range(1, b + 1):
    x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
    if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
        suma += x
print(suma - 1)
```
is not aligned with the correct approach of counting multiples of \(b\) up to \(n\).

#### Correct Approach Recap:
The correct approach involves iterating over each possible \(b\) from 1 to \(m\) and counting how many multiples of \(b\) exist up to \(n\). This is done using the formula \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{b} \right\rfloor\).

#### Conclusion Recap:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not implement the correct logic and provides a correct implementation example:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        result = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            result += n // b
        print(result)

func()
```

### Final Evaluation:
Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the errors in the provided code and suggesting a correct approach. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Final: **False**
