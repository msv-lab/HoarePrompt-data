Output State: **`t` is incremented by 1, `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of substrings from the input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1, `suma` is `x`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, and `(a - i * (i - 1)) > 0`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `suma` is updated to be equal to `x`. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions.
