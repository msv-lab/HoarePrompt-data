The code snippet assigns the first and second elements of the `info` list to the variables `a` and `b` respectively, after converting them to integers. The values of `t`, `T`, and the remaining elements of `info` (if any) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is incremented by 1
- `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1
- `info` is a list of substrings from the input line

After executing the code:
- `a` is assigned the integer value of `info[0]`
- `b` is assigned the integer value of `info[1]`

Output State: **`t` is incremented by 1, `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of substrings from the input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`.**
