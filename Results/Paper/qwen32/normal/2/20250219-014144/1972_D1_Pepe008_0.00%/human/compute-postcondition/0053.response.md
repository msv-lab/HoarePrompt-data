The code snippet increments `suma` by the value of `x`. No other variables are modified directly by this code snippet.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is incremented by 1
- `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1
- `info` is a list of substrings from the input line
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`
- `b` must be at least 1
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`

After executing the code `suma += x`, the value of `suma` is updated by adding `x` to its previous value. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is incremented by 1, `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of substrings from the input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `suma` is updated by adding `x` to its previous value.**
