The code appends a new tuple to the `details` list. The tuple contains three elements: `balance`, `-i`, and `char`. The value of `balance` is updated based on whether `char` is '(' or ')'. Since `i` is incremented before the character `char` (which is `s[i + 1]`) is evaluated, the new value of `i` is used in the tuple.

Given the initial state, `s` remains unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1. The `details` list now includes an additional tuple with the updated `balance`, the negated new value of `i`, and the character `char`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `details` is a list containing tuples, the last of which is `(balance, -i, char)` where `balance` is incremented by 1 if `char` is '(', otherwise decremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, and `char` is `s[i]`.**
