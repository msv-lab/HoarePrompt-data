The code increments the `balance` variable by 1. The other variables (`s`, `details`, `i`, and `char`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `details` is a list containing one tuple `(balance, -i, char)`; `i` is `i + 1`; `char` is `s[i + 1]`; `balance` is incremented by 1.**
