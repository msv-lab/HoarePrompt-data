The code appends a tuple to the list `details`. The tuple contains the current value of `balance`, the negative of the current value of `i`, and the current character `char`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `char` is the next character in the string `s`.
- `balance` is incremented by 1 if `char` is '(', otherwise `balance` is decreased by 1.

After executing the line `details.append((balance, -i, char))`, the list `details` will have a new entry with the current values of `balance`, `-i`, and `char`.

The values of `i`, `char`, and `balance` remain unchanged except for their usage in the tuple. The string `s` and its properties are also unaffected.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `char` is the next character in the string `s`, `balance` is incremented by 1 if `char` is '(', otherwise `balance` is decreased by 1, `details` now includes the tuple `(balance, -i, char)`**.
