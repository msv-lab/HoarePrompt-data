To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze its logic step-by-step against the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Prefix Balance Calculation**: The program calculates the prefix balance for each character in the input string `s`. The prefix balance at any point is the count of opening parentheses `(` minus the count of closing parentheses `)` up to that point.

2. **Storing Details**: It stores these prefix balances along with the negative index of each character and the character itself in a list called `details`.

3. **Sorting**: The list `details` is sorted primarily by the prefix balance in ascending order and secondarily by the negative index in descending order (which effectively sorts by the original index in ascending order when ties occur).

4. **Reconstructing the Result**: After sorting, the program reconstructs the result string by concatenating the characters from the sorted list.

### Verification Against the Problem Description

- **Prefix Balance Calculation**: The program correctly computes the prefix balance for each character in the sequence.
- **Storing Details**: The program stores the prefix balance, the negative index, and the character itself in the `details` list.
- **Sorting**: The sorting criteria match the problem description: first by prefix balance in ascending order, then by position in decreasing order (achieved by storing the negative index).
- **Result Construction**: The final step of joining the characters from the sorted list indeed produces the balanced shuffle as described.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
