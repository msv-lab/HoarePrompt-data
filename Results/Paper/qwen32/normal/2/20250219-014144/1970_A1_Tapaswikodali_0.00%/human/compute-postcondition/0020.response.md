To determine the final state of the loop after it has executed all iterations, we need to understand how the `balance` and `details` variables evolve as the loop processes each character in the string `s`.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `balance` starts at 0.
   - `details` starts as an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each character in the string `s`:
     - If the character is `'('`, `balance` is incremented by 1.
     - If the character is `')'`, `balance` is decremented by 1.
     - A tuple `(balance, -i, char)` is appended to `details`, where `i` is the current index of the character in the string `s`.

3. **Final State**:
   - Since `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, the `balance` will be 0 after processing all characters in `s`. This is because every `'('` increments `balance` by 1 and every `')'` decrements it by 1, and since the sequence is balanced, the total number of `'('` equals the total number of `')'`.
   - The `details` list will contain a tuple for each character in `s`, with each tuple representing the `balance` at that point, the negative index of the character, and the character itself.

Therefore, after the loop has executed all iterations, the final state is:
- `balance` will be 0.
- `details` will be a list of tuples, one for each character in `s`, where each tuple contains the `balance` at that point, the negative index of the character, and the character itself.

Output State: **`balance` is 0; `details` is a list of tuples `(balance, -i, char)` for each character in `s`.**
