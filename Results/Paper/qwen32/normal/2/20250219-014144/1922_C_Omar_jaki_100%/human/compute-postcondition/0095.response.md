Postcondition: **`u` is `c_new - 1`, the list remains [0, 0, y - x, y - x, y - x + v, y - x + v, y - x + v], `c` and `d` are the values returned by `r()` in this iteration (`c_new` and `d_new`) with `c` being less than `d`, `t` is False, `a` is (-1000000000.0, `c_new`, `d_new`, 2000000000.0), `b` is [0, 0, 1, 1]**
