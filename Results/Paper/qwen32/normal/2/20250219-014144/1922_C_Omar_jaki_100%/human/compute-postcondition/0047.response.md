To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given loop, let's analyze the loop structure and the provided state.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for (w, x, y, z) in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop uses the `zip` function to iterate over four slices of the list `a` simultaneously:
- `a` starts from the first element.
- `a[1:]` starts from the second element.
- `a[2:]` starts from the third element.
- `a[3:]` starts from the fourth element.

In each iteration, `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned values from these four slices respectively.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `b` is `[0, 0, v]`.

Since `b` is not used in the loop, it does not affect the loop's execution. We need to focus on the list `a` and its indices.

Let's assume the state of `a` at the end of the previous iteration was such that the loop had just completed an iteration with specific values of `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`. To proceed to the next iteration, the indices for `a`, `a[1:]`, `a[2:]`, and `a[3:]` must be incremented by 1.

For example, if in the previous iteration:
- `w` was `a[i]`
- `x` was `a[i+1]`
- `y` was `a[i+2]`
- `z` was `a[i+3]`

Then, for the next iteration:
- `w` should be `a[i+1]`
- `x` should be `a[i+2]`
- `y` should be `a[i+3]`
- `z` should be `a[i+4]`

This means the starting index `i` for the next iteration should be `i+1`.

However, since the exact state of `a` is not provided, we can only infer the general rule. Let's assume `a` had enough elements to complete the previous iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least four more elements starting from the new index.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`b` is `[0, 0, v]`, `a` must have at least four more elements starting from the next index**.

If we denote the current index as `i`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be incremented by 1. But without the exact length of `a`, we can't specify the exact values of `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`. The important part is that `a` must be long enough to provide these values.

So the final state considering only the objects in the loop head (`a`):

State: **`b` is `[0, 0, v]`, `a` must have at least four more elements**.
