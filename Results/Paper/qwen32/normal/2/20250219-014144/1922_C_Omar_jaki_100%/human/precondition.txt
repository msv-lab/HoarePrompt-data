t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case in test_cases is a tuple containing three elements: an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, a list of integers a of length n where 0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9, and an integer m such that 1 <= m <= 10^5. Additionally, for each test case, there are m tuples representing queries, where each query is a pair of integers (x_i, y_i) such that 1 <= x_i, y_i <= n and x_i != y_i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
