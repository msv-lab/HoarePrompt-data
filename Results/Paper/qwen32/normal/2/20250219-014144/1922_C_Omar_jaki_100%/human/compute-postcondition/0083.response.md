To determine the new state after executing the given Python code, let's analyze the code step by step.

Given:
- Initial State: `u` is 0, the list remains `[0, 0, y - x, y - x, 2 * (y - x), 2 * (y - x), 2 * (y - x)]`, `c` and `d` are the values returned by `r()` in this iteration (`c_new` and `d_new`), `t` is False, `a` is `(-1000000000.0, c_new, d_new, 2000000000.0)`, `b` is `[0, 0]`, `v` is `y - x`

Code to execute:
```python
b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
```

Let's break down the code:
- `b[-2]` refers to the second last element of the list `b`, which is `0`.
- `b[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `b`, which is also `0`.
- `v ** (v > x - w)` evaluates to `v` if `v > x - w` is True, otherwise it evaluates to `1`. Since the exact values of `x`, `w`, `y`, and `z` are not specified, we'll keep this expression as it is.
- Similarly, `v ** (v > z - y)` evaluates to `v` if `v > z - y` is True, otherwise it evaluates to `1`.

So, the code effectively appends two elements to the list `b`:
1. `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)` which simplifies to `0 + v ** (v > x - w)`
2. `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)` which simplifies to `0 + v ** (v > z - y)`

Thus, the new elements added to `b` are `v ** (v > x - w)` and `v ** (v > z - y)`.

Output State: **`u` is 0, the list remains `[0, 0, y - x, y - x, 2 * (y - x), 2 * (y - x), 2 * (y - x)]`, `c` and `d` are the values returned by `r()` in this iteration (`c_new` and `d_new`), `t` is False, `a` is `(-1000000000.0, c_new, d_new, 2000000000.0)`, `b` is `[0, 0, v ** (v > x - w), v ** (v > z - y)]`, `v` is `y - x`**

Natural Language Explanation:
After executing the code, the list `b` is updated to include two new elements: `v ** (v > x - w)` and `v ** (v > z - y)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
