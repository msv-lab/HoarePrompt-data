To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop modifies the list `a`. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, and in each iteration, it appends a new element to the list `a`. This new element is calculated as the difference between the last element of `a` (which was added in the previous iteration) and the corresponding element in the list `T`.

Let's break down the process:

1. Initially, `a` contains one element: `[1000]`.
2. After the first iteration (`i = 1`), `a` becomes `[1000, 1000 - T[0]]`.
3. After the second iteration (`i = 2`), `a` becomes `[1000, 1000 - T[0], 1000 - T[0] - T[1]]`.
4. After the third iteration (`i = 3`), `a` becomes `[1000, 1000 - T[0], 1000 - T[0] - T[1], 1000 - T[0] - T[1] - T[2]]`.

Following this pattern, after `n-1` iterations, the list `a` will contain `n` elements, where each element is the cumulative subtraction of the corresponding elements in `T` from the initial value of 1000.

Thus, the final state of `a` will be:
\[ a = [1000, 1000 - T[0], 1000 - T[0] - T[1], \ldots, 1000 - T[0] - T[1] - \cdots - T[n-2]] \]

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, and `T`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 500; `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in the input string `line` to integers; `a` is a list containing the integers [1000, 1000 - T[0], 1000 - T[0] - T[1], ..., 1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2]].**

In simpler terms, the list `a` will have `n` elements, starting with 1000 and each subsequent element being the result of subtracting the corresponding elements of `T` from the previous element in `a`. All other variables remain the same as they were initially.
