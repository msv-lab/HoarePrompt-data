The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (not inclusive). At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1.
- `n` is the input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500.
- `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 500.
- `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in the input string `line` to integers.
- `a` is a list containing the integers [1000, 1000 - T[0], ..., a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]].
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1.

Since the loop condition is `for i in range(1, n)`, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Therefore, if `i` was 1 at the start of the previous iteration and was incremented to 2 at the end of that iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 3.

No other variables in the loop head need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 500; `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in the input string `line` to integers; `a` is a list containing the integers [1000, 1000 - T[0], ..., a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]]; `i` is 3**
