To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the calculations step-by-step:

1. **Variable Initialization and Input:**
   - `n` is an integer input such that \(2 \leq n \leq 500\).
   - `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element \(x_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq x_i \leq 500\). However, `x` is not used in the given code snippet.
   - `line` is a newly input string.
   - `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in the input string `line` to integers. This implies `T` contains `n-1` integers.
   - `a` is a list calculated as follows:
     - The first element of `a` is \(1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + \ldots + T[n-2])\).
     - The second element of `a` is \(1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + \ldots + T[n-3])\).
     - This pattern continues until the last element of `a`, which is simply `1000`.

2. **Constructing List `a`:**
   - The list `a` is constructed such that each element is calculated by subtracting the cumulative sum of the elements of `T` up to a certain point from 1000.
   - Specifically, the \(i\)-th element of `a` (starting from 0) is \(1000 - \text{sum}(T[0:i])\).

3. **Result Construction:**
   - `result` is a space-separated string of the elements in `a`.

Given this information, the `print(result)` statement will output the space-separated string of the elements in `a`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider an example to illustrate this:
- Suppose `n = 4`, so `T` will have 3 elements.
- Let `T = [100, 200, 300]`.
- Then, `a` will be calculated as follows:
  - First element: \(1000 - (100 + 200 + 300) = 1000 - 600 = 400\)
  - Second element: \(1000 - (100 + 200) = 1000 - 300 = 700\)
  - Third element: \(1000 - 100 = 900\)
  - Fourth element: \(1000\)
- Therefore, `a = [400, 700, 900, 1000]`.
- `result` will be the string `"400 700 900 1000"`.

### General Case:
In the general case, the output will be a space-separated string of the elements in `a`, where each element is calculated as described above.

Thus, the output of the `print(result)` statement is:

Output: **a (where a is a list of integers calculated as [1000 - sum(T[0:n-2]), 1000 - sum(T[0:n-3]), ..., 1000 - T[0], 1000] and result is the space-separated string of these integers)**
