Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 500; `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in the input string `line` to integers; `a` is a list containing the integers [1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2], ..., 1000 - T[0] - T[1], 1000 - T[0], 1000] in reverse order; `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`.**

Natural Language: The value of `t` has been decremented by 1. All other variables (`n`, `x`, `T`, `a`, and `result`) remain unchanged.
