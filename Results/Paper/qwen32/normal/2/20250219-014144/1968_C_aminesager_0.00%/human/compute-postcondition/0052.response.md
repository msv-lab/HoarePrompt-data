Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n-1` integers. For each test case, it calculates a list of `n` integers where each integer is derived by subtracting the cumulative sum of the previous elements from 1000, in reverse order. It then prints this list as a space-separated string.**
