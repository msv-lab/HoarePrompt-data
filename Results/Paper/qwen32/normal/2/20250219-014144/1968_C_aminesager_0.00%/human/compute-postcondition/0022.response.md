The code snippet reassigns the variable `a` to a new list containing only the integer `1000`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the newly input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 500; `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in the input string `line` to integers; `a` is a list containing the single integer [1000]; `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`; `line` is the newly input string.**
