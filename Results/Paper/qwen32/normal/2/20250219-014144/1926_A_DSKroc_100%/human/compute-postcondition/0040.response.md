The code snippet provided increments the value of the variable `ac` by 1. None of the other variables (`t`, `s`, `q`, `i`) are modified by this line of code.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32
- `s` is a non-empty string
- `q` is `q_end + 1`
- `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the current `i`

After executing `ac += 1`, only `ac` changes. Since the initial value of `ac` is not specified, we can only say that it has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32; `s` is a non-empty string; `q` is `q_end + 1`; `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the current `i`; `ac` is incremented by 1.**
