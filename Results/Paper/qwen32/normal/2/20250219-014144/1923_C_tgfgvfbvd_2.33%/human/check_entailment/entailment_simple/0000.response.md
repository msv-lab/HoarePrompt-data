### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program and see if it correctly determines whether a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions.

1. **Cumulative Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the cumulative sum of the array `l` and stores it in the list `p`.
   - This allows for efficient calculation of the sum of any subarray `c[l_i...r_i]` using the formula `s = p[r_i - 1] - p[l_i - 2]` (if `l_i > 1`).

2. **Checking Subarray Conditions:**
   - For each query, the program calculates the sum `s` of the subarray `c[l_i...r_i]`.
   - It then checks if the subarray length (`r_i - l_i + 1`) is greater than 1 and if `s` is at least twice the length of the subarray.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints "YES", indicating that the subarray is "good". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

3. **Conditions Analysis:**
   - **Condition 1:** The sum of the subarray should equal the sum of another array `b` of the same length.
     - The program ensures that the sum `s` of the subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray. This implies that we can potentially construct an array `b` where each element is at least 1 and different from the corresponding element in the subarray `c`.
   - **Condition 2:** No element in the subarray `c` should be equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
     - By ensuring that `s` is at least twice the length of the subarray, we can always adjust the values in `b` to be different from those in `c` while maintaining the sum condition.
   - **Condition 3:** All elements in `b` should be greater than 0.
     - Since the elements in `c` are already greater than 0 and we ensure that `b` has a sum at least twice the length of the subarray, we can construct `b` with all positive elements.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly checks whether a subarray is "good" based on the provided conditions.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
