To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the variables `c` and `p` evolve throughout the loop. The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `l`, updating `c` and appending the updated `c` to the list `p`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the changes:

- Initially, `c` is set to 0 and `p` is an empty list.
- For each element `x` in `l`, `c` is incremented by `x`, and the new value of `c` is appended to `p`.

After the loop finishes executing all iterations, the following will be true:
- `c` will be the sum of all elements in `l`.
- `p` will be a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the final output state can be described as follows:

- `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `m` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `l` remains unchanged as it is only being iterated over.
- `p` will be a list of cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `c` will be the total sum of all elements in `l`.

Let's formalize this in the required format:

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `c` will hold the sum of all numbers in `l`, and `p` will contain a running total of these sums as the loop progresses through each element in `l`.
