The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `l`. This means that the previous list stored in `l` is overwritten with the new list of integers from the input.

Since `l` is updated, `p` (which contains the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`) and `c` (which is the sum of all elements in `l`) become outdated and need to be recalculated based on the new `l`. However, the code snippet does not perform these recalculations, so `p` and `c` retain their previous values.

The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `l` is the new list of integers read from the input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in the previous `l`, and `c` is the sum of all elements in the previous `l`.**
