To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each element in the list `l`. The loop iterates over each element `x` in `l`, adds it to the cumulative sum `c`, and appends this cumulative sum to the list `p`.

Let's break down the process step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 10^4 (remains unchanged).
   - `n`: The first integer read from the input (remains unchanged).
   - `m`: The second integer read from the input (remains unchanged).
   - `l`: A list of integers read from the input.
   - `p`: An initially empty list.
   - `c`: An initially zero integer.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each element `x` in `l`:
     - `c` is updated to `c + x`.
     - `p` is updated to include the new value of `c`.

After the loop completes, `c` will hold the sum of all elements in `l`, and `p` will contain the cumulative sums after each element in `l` has been processed.

### Final Output State
- `t`: Remains the same as the initial state.
- `n`: Remains the same as the initial state.
- `m`: Remains the same as the initial state.
- `l`: Remains the same as the initial state.
- `p`: A list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point.
- `c`: The sum of all elements in `l`.

**Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, and `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `p` will have the cumulative sums of the list `l`, and `c` will be the total sum of all elements in `l`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, and `l`) will remain unchanged from their initial states.
