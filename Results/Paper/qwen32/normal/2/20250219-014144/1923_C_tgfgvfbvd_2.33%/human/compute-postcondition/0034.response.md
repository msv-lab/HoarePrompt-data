The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `m`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not affect the loop's continuation, the only variable we need to adjust is `m`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `m` has been decremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, we need to increment `m` by 1 to reflect its value at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input. If `a` is at least 2, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`; otherwise, `s` is `p[b - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the conditions specified in the if part hold. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1, or `s` is less than 2 * (b - a + 1).**
