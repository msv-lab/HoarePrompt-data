The code appends the current value of `c` to the list `p`. Given that `c` is defined as `c + x + x`, where `x` is the next element in the list `l`, the value of `c` will be updated before appending it to `p`.

Since `c` is initially `c + x + x`, after appending `c` to `p`, `p` will now contain the value of `c` which is `c + 2*x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 2 integers, `p` is a list containing the value of `c` and the new value `c + 2*x`, `c` is `c + x + x`, `x` is the next element in `l`.**
