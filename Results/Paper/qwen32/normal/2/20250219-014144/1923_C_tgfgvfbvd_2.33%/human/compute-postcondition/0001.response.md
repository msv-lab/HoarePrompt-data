The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state only specifies that the input function returns `t`, which is not directly relevant to the values of `n` and `m` after the execution of the given code.

Output State: **The input function returns `t`, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer read from the input; `m` is the second integer read from the input.**
