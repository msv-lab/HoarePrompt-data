The code appends the value of `c` to the list `p`. Since `c` is initially 0, `p` will now contain the single element 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `l` is a list of integers with at least one element, `p` is a list containing the integer 0, `c` is 0**.
