The code assigns the value of `p[b - 1]` to the variable `s`. None of the other variables are modified by this assignment.

Given that `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, and `b` is the second integer read from the new input, `s` will take the value of the element at index `b - 1` in the list `p`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `a` is the first integer read from the new input, `b` is the second integer read from the new input, `s` is `p[b - 1]`.**
