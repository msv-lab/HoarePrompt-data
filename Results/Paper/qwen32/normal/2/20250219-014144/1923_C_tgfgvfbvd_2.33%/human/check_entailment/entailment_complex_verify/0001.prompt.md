You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    #State: The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4 representing the total number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is the number of integers in the list `l`, and `m` is the number of queries. The list `l` contains `n` integers, and `p` is a list of cumulative sums derived from `l`. The variable `c` holds the total sum of all elements in `l`. The loop has processed all `m` queries for each of the `t` test cases. For each query defined by `a` and `b`, the sum `s` of the subarray from index `a-1` to `b-1` is calculated using the cumulative sums in `p`. If the length of the subarray is greater than 1 and the sum `s` is at least twice the length of the subarray, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines if the sum of a specified subarray is at least twice the length of that subarray, printing 'YES' if true and 'NO' otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

We need to determine if a subarray `c[l..r]` is "good" based on the following criteria:
1. There exists an integer array `b` of the same length such that the sum of elements in `b` equals the sum of elements in `c[l..r]`.
2. Every element in `b` must be different from the corresponding element in `c[l..r]`.
3. Every element in `b` must be positive.

### Key Observations

- To satisfy condition 1, the sum of `b` must equal the sum of `c[l..r]`.
- To satisfy condition 2, since `b[i] != c[i]` for all `i`, we need at least one unit difference for each element.
- To satisfy condition 3, `b[i] > 0`.

Given these points, let's consider the sum of the subarray `c[l..r]`. If the sum of the subarray is `S`, then to create a new array `b` where each element is different from `c[l..r]` and still sums up to `S`, we need to ensure that we can adjust each element in `c[l..r]` to form `b` while maintaining the sum `S`.

### Condition for a Subarray to be Good

If the subarray has more than one element, it is always possible to construct `b` by adjusting each element in `c[l..r]` such that:
- We decrease some elements by 1 and increase others by 1 (or more), ensuring that the sum remains the same.
- We ensure that no element becomes zero or negative.

This means that if the subarray has more than one element, it is always "good". The only exception is when the subarray has exactly one element. In this case, it is impossible to find a different positive integer that sums to the same value.

Thus, a subarray `c[l..r]` is "good" if and only if it has more than one element.

### Program Analysis

The provided program calculates the prefix sums of the array `c` and then checks each query to see if the subarray `c[l..r]` has more than one element. If it does, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

Here's the relevant part of the code:
```python
if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```
However, the condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` is unnecessary. The only condition that matters is whether the subarray has more than one element (`b - a + 1 > 1`).

### Conclusion

The program is almost correct but includes an unnecessary condition. The correct condition should simply check if the subarray has more than one element. Since the current implementation works correctly for the given problem constraints, we can consider it correct.

Correctness: **True**
