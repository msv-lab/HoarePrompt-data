The given code snippet `c += x` attempts to increment the variable `c` by the value of `x`. However, the variable `x` is not defined in the initial state provided. Since `x` is undefined, we cannot determine its value, and thus, we cannot compute the new value of `c`.

Given the constraints and the provided initial state, the only variable that could potentially change is `c`, but since `x` is not defined, `c` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `p` is an empty list, `c` is 0**
