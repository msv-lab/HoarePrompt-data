The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. This means that the previous values of `n` and `m` are overwritten. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the operation. The list `l`, the list `p`, and the variable `c` are also not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.**
