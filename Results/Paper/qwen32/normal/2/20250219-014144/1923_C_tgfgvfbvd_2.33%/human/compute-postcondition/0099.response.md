The code appends the current value of `c` to the list `p`. 

Given the initial state, `p` already contains two elements: the initial value of `c` and the value `c + 2*x`. After executing the line `p.append(c)`, `p` will now contain three elements: the initial value of `c`, the value `c + 2*x`, and the updated value of `c` (which is `c + 2*x + x`).

Therefore, the updated `p` will be `[c, c + 2*x, c + 2*x + x]`.

Other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `c`, `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 2 integers, `p` is a list containing the values `[c, c + 2*x, c + 2*x + x]`, `c` is `c + 2*x + x`, `x` is the second element in `l`.**
