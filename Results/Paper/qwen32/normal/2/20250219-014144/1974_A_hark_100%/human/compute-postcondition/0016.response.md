Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, and at least one of `x` or `y` is 0. It is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, then the specific conditions of the if part hold. Otherwise, the specific conditions of the else part hold.**
