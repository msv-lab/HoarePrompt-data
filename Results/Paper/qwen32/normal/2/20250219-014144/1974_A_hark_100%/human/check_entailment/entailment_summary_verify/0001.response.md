### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and the function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. **Grid Size**: Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which means it has 15 cells.
2. **Icon Sizes**: 
   - 1x1 icons occupy 1 cell.
   - 2x2 icons occupy 4 cells.
3. **Objective**: Place all icons on the minimum number of screens.

#### Analysis of the Provided Code:
1. **Function Call Issue**: The code calls `func_1()` before defining it, which indeed results in a `NameError`. This is a critical issue that must be fixed for the program to run correctly.
2. **Logic for Calculating Screens**:
   - **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0**:
     - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`: This calculates the minimum number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons. Since each screen can fit up to 2 2x2 icons (8 cells), this formula is correct.
     - `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`: This adjustment is incorrect. The logic here seems flawed. Instead, we should calculate the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons and then determine how many 1x1 icons can fit into those remaining cells.
     - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)`: This calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. However, the value of `x` after the previous incorrect adjustment is unreliable.
     - `print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)`: This sums the screens needed for 2x2 and 1x1 icons.
   - **Case 2: `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0**:
     - `print(math.ceil(y / 2))`: This is correct as explained.
   - **Case 3: `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0**:
     - `print(math.ceil(x / 15))`: This is correct as explained.
   - **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0**:
     - `print(0)`: This is correct as no screens are needed.

#### Corrected Logic:
When both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
1. Calculate `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`.
2. Calculate the total cells occupied by 2x2 icons: `cells_occupied_by_2x2 = 4 * y`.
3. Calculate the remaining cells available after placing the 2x2 icons: `remaining_cells = 15 * bxsfory - cells_occupied_by_2x2`.
4. Calculate the remaining 1x1 icons that need to be placed: `remaining_x = x - remaining_cells`.
5. Calculate `bxsfory1 = 0 if remaining_x <= 0 else math.ceil(remaining_x / 15)`.
6. Print `bxsfory + bxsfory1`.

### Conclusion:
The program has significant logical errors, particularly in the handling of the remaining 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. Additionally, there is a syntax error due to the function call before its definition. These issues need to be addressed for the program to be correct.

**Final: False**
