Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is greater than 0, and `k` is incremented by 1. If `x > 0` and `y > 0`, then `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` where `bxsfory` is `math.ceil(y / 2)`, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x <= 0` else `math.ceil(x / 15)`. Otherwise, `x` and `y` remain unchanged.**
