To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code execution step by step.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `ap` is greater than 0.
- `x` is greater than 0.
- `y` is 0.
- At least one of `x` or `y` is 0, and it is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(math.ceil(x / 15))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `x`:** We know that `x` is greater than 0.
2. **Division `x / 15`:** Since `x` is a positive number, dividing `x` by 15 will result in a positive number as well. The exact value depends on the specific value of `x`.
3. **`math.ceil()` Function:** The `math.ceil()` function rounds a number up to the nearest integer. This means if `x / 15` is not already an integer, `math.ceil(x / 15)` will round it up to the next whole number.

### Output Description:
Given that `x` is a positive integer, the expression `x / 15` will yield a positive floating-point number. The `math.ceil()` function will then round this number up to the nearest integer.

Since the exact value of `x` is not specified, we cannot determine a specific numerical output. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the given information.

### Final Output:
Output: **the smallest integer greater than or equal to `x / 15` (where `x` is a positive integer greater than 0)**
