To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we need to consider the behavior of the loop based on the provided code and the given conditions.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop runs `ap` times.
- For each iteration, it reads two integers `x` and `y`.
- Depending on the values of `x` and `y`, it performs different calculations and prints a result.

### Key Points:
- The value of `t` (number of test cases) does not change during the loop execution.
- The value of `ap` (number of iterations) determines how many times the loop will run.
- The values of `x` and `y` are re-read for each iteration, so they do not persist between iterations.

### Final Output State:
After all iterations (`ap` iterations), the loop will have printed a result for each pair of `x` and `y` read from the input. The final state of the variables `t` and `ap` remains unchanged, but the loop itself will have no more iterations left to perform.

### Output State Description:
- `t` remains the same as the initial state (number of test cases).
- `ap` remains the same as the initial state (number of iterations).
- No further changes occur to `x` and `y` since they are re-read for each iteration and do not persist outside of the current iteration.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `ap` is an integer representing the number of iterations which has been fully executed. No further changes to `x` and `y` as they are re-read for each iteration.**
