Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers x and y such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `ap` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(ap):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
    else:
        print(0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, then `x` is updated to `x - ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4`, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if the updated `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is `math.ceil(updated x / 15)`. If at least one of `x` or `y` is 0, then `x` and `y` retain their original values, with the condition that if `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, `y` remains a positive integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, and `k` is incremented by 1. If both `x > 0` and `y > 0`, then `x` is updated to `x - ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4` and `bxsfory` is set to the ceiling of `y / 2`; `bxsfory1` is `0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)`. Otherwise, `x` and `y` retain their original values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is greater than 0, and `k` is incremented by 1. If `x > 0` and `y > 0`, then `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` where `bxsfory` is `math.ceil(y / 2)`, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x <= 0` else `math.ceil(x / 15)`. Otherwise, `x` and `y` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
