The code calculates `bxsfory` as the ceiling of `y / 2`. Given that `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, `bxsfory` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `k` is incremented by 1, `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`.**
