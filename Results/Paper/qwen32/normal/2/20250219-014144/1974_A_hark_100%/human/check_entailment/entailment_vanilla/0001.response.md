Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by calling `func_1()` before defining it, which will result in a `NameError` because `func_1()` is not defined at the point of its initial call. This is a critical issue that needs to be fixed for the program to run correctly.

2. **Reading Test Cases:**
   - Once the function definition is corrected, the program reads the number of test cases (`ap`) and then iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

3. **Calculating Screens Needed:**
   - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
     - It calculates `bxsfory` as the ceiling of `y / 2`. This represents the minimum number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons, assuming each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons (since each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells and a 5x3 grid can fit 2 2x2 icons).
     - It then adjusts `x` by subtracting `bxsfory * 15` (the total number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons) and adding `y * 4` (which seems incorrect and unnecessary since we already accounted for the cells occupied by 2x2 icons). This adjustment is incorrect and should be revised.
     - It calculates `bxsfory1` as the ceiling of the remaining `x` divided by 15, which represents the minimum number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
     - Finally, it prints the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.
   
   - If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0:
     - It simply prints the ceiling of `y / 2`, which is correct as explained above.
   
   - If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0:
     - It prints the ceiling of `x / 15`, which is correct as explained above.
   
   - If both `x` and `y` are 0:
     - It prints 0, which is correct as no screens are needed.

### Issues Identified:
- **Function Call Before Definition:** The program calls `func_1()` before defining it, which will cause a runtime error.
- **Incorrect Adjustment of `x`:** The adjustment of `x` by subtracting `bxsfory * 15` and adding `y * 4` is incorrect. We should only consider the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.

### Revised Calculation:
- When both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
  - Calculate `bxsfory` as the ceiling of `y / 2`.
  - Calculate the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons: `remaining_cells = 15 * bxsfory - 4 * y`.
  - Calculate the remaining 1x1 icons that need to be placed: `remaining_x = x - (15 * bxsfory - 4 * y)`.
  - Calculate `bxsfory1` as the ceiling of `remaining_x / 15`.
  - Print `bxsfory + bxsfory1`.

### Conclusion:
The program has logical issues and a syntax error due to the function call before its definition. Therefore, it is not correct as it stands.

**Correctness: False**
