To determine what will be printed by the `print(math.ceil(y / 2))` statement, let's break down the given information:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `ap` is greater than 0.
- `x` and `y` are integers provided in the input.
- `k` is incremented by 1, but it is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this specific task.

The `print` statement uses the `math.ceil()` function, which rounds a number up to the nearest integer. The argument passed to `math.ceil()` is `y / 2`.

Given that `y` is an integer, `y / 2` will result in a float. The `math.ceil()` function will then round this float up to the nearest integer.

For example:
- If `y` is 5, `y / 2` is 2.5, and `math.ceil(2.5)` is 3.
- If `y` is 6, `y / 2` is 3.0, and `math.ceil(3.0)` is 3.
- If `y` is 7, `y / 2` is 3.5, and `math.ceil(3.5)` is 4.

Since the exact value of `y` is not specified, we can't determine a specific numerical output. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the value of `y`.

Output: **the smallest integer greater than or equal to y / 2 (where y is the integer provided in the input)**
