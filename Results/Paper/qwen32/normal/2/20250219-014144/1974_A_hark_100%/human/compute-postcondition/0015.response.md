Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `ap` is greater than 0.
- `x` and `y` are two integers read from the input such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 99\).
- At least one of `x` or `y` is 0.
- It is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0.
- It is not the case that `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is equal to 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(0)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(0)` statement directly prints the integer `0`. The values of `t`, `ap`, `x`, and `y` do not affect the execution of this specific print statement because it explicitly prints the number `0`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print(0)` statement is simply the number `0`.

### Final Output:
Output: **0**
