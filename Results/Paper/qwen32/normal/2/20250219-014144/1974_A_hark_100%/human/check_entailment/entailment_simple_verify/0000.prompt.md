You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in how it calculates the number of screens required. Specifically, the formula used to calculate the remaining `x` after placing `2x2` icons is incorrect.

Let's analyze the problematic part of the code:

```python
if x > 0 and y > 0:
    bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
    x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
    bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
    print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
```

Here, `bxsfory` calculates the number of screens needed for `2x2` icons, assuming each screen can fit up to 2 `2x2` icons (which is correct). However, the line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. It subtracts `15` times the number of screens for `2x2` icons from `x` and then adds `4` times the number of `2x2` icons back to `x`. This calculation does not correctly account for the space taken by `2x2` icons.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
10 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- We have 10 `1x1` icons and 2 `2x2` icons.
- Each `2x2` icon takes up 4 cells, so 2 `2x2` icons take up 8 cells.
- This leaves us with 2 cells for `1x1` icons.
- Since each screen has 15 cells, we need 1 screen for the 2 `2x2` icons and another screen for the remaining 2 `1x1` icons, totaling 2 screens.

**Actual Output of Provided Program:**
```
3
```

This is because the program incorrectly calculates the remaining `1x1` icons after placing `2x2` icons, leading to an incorrect number of screens.

Thus, the program is incorrect due to this logical error.
