To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given Python code snippet and see how it affects the variables:

```
bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
```

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `ap` is greater than 0
- `x` is updated to `x - ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4`
- `y` is the same integer read from the input such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 99
- `k` is incremented by 1
- `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`

The code snippet assigns a new value to `bxsfory1` based on the condition `if x <= 0`. Let's break down the possible outcomes:

1. If `x <= 0`, then `bxsfory1` is set to `0`.
2. If `x > 0`, then `bxsfory1` is set to `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

Since `x` is already updated to `x - ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4`, we need to consider the value of `x` in these conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `ap` is greater than 0; `x` is updated to `x - ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4`; `y` is the same integer read from the input such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 99; `k` is incremented by 1; `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`; `bxsfory1` is `0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)`**

In simpler terms, the output state is:
- `t` remains the same integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `ap` remains greater than 0.
- `x` is recalculated as `x - ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4`.
- `y` remains the same integer input between 0 and 99.
- `k` is incremented by 1.
- `bxsfory` remains the ceiling of `y / 2`.
- `bxsfory1` is determined by whether `x` is less than or equal to 0 (in which case it's 0) or greater than 0 (in which case it's the ceiling of `x / 15`).
