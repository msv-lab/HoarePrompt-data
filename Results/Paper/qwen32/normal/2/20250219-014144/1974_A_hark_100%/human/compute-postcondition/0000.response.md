The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `ap`. This means that `ap` will hold the integer value provided by the user input. The values of `t`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers x and y such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `ap` is an input integer.**
