### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its logic against the problem description and the function summary.

#### Key Points:
1. **Grid Size**: Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which means it has 15 cells.
2. **Icon Sizes**: 
   - 1x1 icons occupy 1 cell.
   - 2x2 icons occupy 4 cells.
3. **Objective**: Place all icons on the minimum number of screens.

#### Analysis of the Code:
The code provided in `func_1` attempts to determine the minimum number of screens required for each test case. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the number of 1x1 icons (`x`) and 2x2 icons (`y`) is read.

2. **Logic for Calculation**:
   - **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0**:
     ```python
     bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
     x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
     bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
     print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
     ```
     - `bxsfory` calculates the number of screens needed for `2x2` icons. Since each screen can hold at most 2 `2x2` icons (taking 8 cells), `math.ceil(y / 2)` gives the number of screens needed.
     - The next line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is problematic. It subtracts `15` times the number of screens for `2x2` icons from `x` and then adds `4` times the number of `2x2` icons back to `x`. This does not correctly account for the space taken by `2x2` icons.
     - The correct approach should be to subtract the total number of cells occupied by `2x2` icons from `x` before calculating the remaining `1x1` icons.

   - **Case 2: Only `y` is greater than 0**:
     ```python
     print(math.ceil(y / 2))
     ```
     - This is correct. Each screen can hold at most 2 `2x2` icons, so `math.ceil(y / 2)` gives the number of screens needed.

   - **Case 3: Only `x` is greater than 0**:
     ```python
     print(math.ceil(x / 15))
     ```
     - This is correct. Each screen can hold up to 15 `1x1` icons, so `math.ceil(x / 15)` gives the number of screens needed.

   - **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0**:
     ```python
     print(0)
     ```
     - This is correct. No screens are needed if there are no icons.

#### Correct Approach:
For the case where both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, the correct logic should be:
1. Calculate the number of screens needed for `2x2` icons: `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`.
2. Subtract the total number of cells occupied by `2x2` icons from `x`: `remaining_x = x - y * 4`.
3. Calculate the number of screens needed for the remaining `1x1` icons: `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(remaining_x / 15)`.
4. Print the total number of screens: `print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)`.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program has a logical error in the calculation of the remaining `1x1` icons after placing `2x2` icons, leading to an incorrect number of screens.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
