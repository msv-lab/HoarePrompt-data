To determine the new state after executing the given code snippet, we need to focus on the changes made to the variables. Specifically, we need to compute the new value of `oneInd` using the function `func_1`.

Given the initial state, `oneInd` is calculated as follows:
```python
oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
```

Here, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'. `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`. 

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot compute the numerical value of `oneInd`. However, we can express `oneInd` in terms of `func_1(preOne, zr)` and `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`.

Therefore, the updated state will reflect the new value of `oneInd` while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a positive integer; `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on the value of `el`: if `el` is '>', it is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 2; otherwise, it is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1; `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and the conditions involving `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi`; `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`; `ol` is equal to `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `fi` is `pre[0]` if `ol > zr` when `el` is '>'; `i` is `0`; `el` is now `s1[0]`; `zeroInd` is `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise `zeroInd` is `2 * (suffZero[-1] + 1)`; `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`**.
