The code appends a new value to the `suffZero` list. This new value is calculated as the sum of the last element in `suffZero` and `i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list that now includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`, and `el` is not equal to '>'**.
