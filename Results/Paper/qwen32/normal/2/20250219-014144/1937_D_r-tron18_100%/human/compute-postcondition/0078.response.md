To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given code snippet and see how it affects the variables.

Given:
- `zeroInd` is being calculated using the function `func_1` applied to `suffZero` and some expressions involving `ol`.

Let's break down the calculation of `zeroInd`:
- `zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`

Since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `zeroInd`. However, we can express `zeroInd` in terms of `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` and `func_1(suffZero, 1)`.

The other variables (`s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `fi`, `i`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a positive integer; `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on the value of `el`: if `el` is '>', it is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 2; otherwise, it is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1; `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0, 1]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and the conditions involving `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi`; `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`; `ol` is equal to `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `fi` is `pre[0]` if `ol > zr` when `el` is '>'; `i` is `0`; `el` is now `s1[0]`; `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`**.
