To determine the new state after executing the given code snippet, let's analyze the impact of the line `oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)` on the existing variables.

Given:
- `oneInd` is initially calculated based on certain conditions.
- `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums.
- `zr` is the length of `suffZero` minus 1.
- `func_1` is a function that presumably operates on `preOne` with the second argument indicating an index or offset.

After executing the line:
- `oneInd` is reassigned to the sum of two function calls: `func_1(preOne, zr)` and `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`.

Since the exact definition of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `func_1(preOne, zr)` and `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`. However, we can express the new value of `oneInd` in terms of these function calls.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre` with the last element removed if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same, `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and the conditions involving `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi`, `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`, `fi` is `pre[0]` if `ol > zr` when `el` is '>', `i` is `i_end - 1`**.

This means that `oneInd` now holds the value resulting from the sum of `func_1(preOne, zr)` and `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`, while all other variables retain their previously defined states.
