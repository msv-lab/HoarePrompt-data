You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` takes a string `s1` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and computes a list of integers based on the positions of these characters. It then prints this list.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap
- We have a 1D grid with cells containing either '<' or '>'.
- A pinball placed on a cell moves left if the cell contains '<' and right if it contains '>'.
- After each move, the direction of the cell is inverted.
- The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.
- For each starting position, we need to determine how many seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

### Analysis of the Provided Program

#### Function `func_1`
```python
def func_1(arr, times):
    n = len(arr)
    return arr[-1] - arr[max(-n, -1 - times)]
```
This function seems to be calculating the difference between the last element of the array and another element determined by `times`. It appears to be a helper function for some kind of prefix/suffix sum calculation.

#### Function `func_2`
```python
def func_2(s1, n):
    pre = [i + 1 for (i, el) in enumerate(s1) if el == '>']
    totalOne = len(pre)
    preOne = list(accumulate(pre, initial=0))
    suffZero = [0]
    ans = [0] * n
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        el = s1[i]
        if el == '>':
            (ol, zr) = (totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1)
            if ol <= zr:
                zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
                oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
            else:
                zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
                oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
                oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
                fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
            preOne.pop()
            totalOne -= 1
        else:
            suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
            (ol, zr) = (totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1)
            if zr <= ol:
                zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
                oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
            else:
                zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
                oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
    print(*ans)
```
This function is more complex and involves several steps:
1. It initializes two lists: `pre` (positions of '>' characters) and `suffZero` (cumulative sums of positions of '<' characters).
2. It iterates through the string `s1` from right to left.
3. Depending on whether the current character is '>' or '<', it calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid using the helper function `func_1`.
4. It updates the cumulative sums and the result array `ans`.

### Verification Against Example

Let's verify the program against the provided example:

#### Test Case 1
```
Input:
3
>><
Output:
3 6 5
```

#### Test Case 2
```
Input:
4
<<<<
Output:
1 2 3 4
```

#### Test Case 3
```
Input:
6
<><<<>
Output:
1 4 7 10 8 1
```

Running the program with these inputs should produce the expected outputs. However, without running the code, it's challenging to definitively prove correctness due to the complexity of the logic.

### Conclusion

Given the complexity of the logic and the fact that the program is designed to handle large inputs efficiently, it is plausible that the program is correct. However, without running the program against a comprehensive set of test cases, we cannot be absolutely certain.

Since the problem constraints are quite strict and the program seems to follow a logical approach, we can reasonably assume it is correct.

Correctness: **True**
