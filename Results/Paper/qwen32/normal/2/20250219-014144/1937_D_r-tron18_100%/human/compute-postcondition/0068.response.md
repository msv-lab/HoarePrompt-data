To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the existing variables. Here's the code snippet again for reference:

```python
fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
```

This line calculates the difference between two function calls to `func_1` with different arguments and assigns the result to `fi`. 

Given the initial state, we know:
- `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums.
- `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.

Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we'll assume it operates on the list `preOne` and returns some value based on the indices provided.

Let's denote:
- `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)` as `value1`.
- `func_1(preOne, zr)` as `value2`.

Thus, `fi` will be `value1 - value2`.

### Impact on Variables:
- `fi` is updated to the result of the subtraction `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`.
- All other variables (`s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`) remain unchanged.

### Output State:
Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a positive integer; `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on the value of `el`: if `el` is '>', it is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 2; otherwise, it is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1; `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and the conditions involving `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi`; `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`; `ol` is equal to `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise `zeroInd` is `2 * (suffZero[-1] + 1)`; `oneInd` is `oneInd - func_1(preOne, 1)`; `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`**.
