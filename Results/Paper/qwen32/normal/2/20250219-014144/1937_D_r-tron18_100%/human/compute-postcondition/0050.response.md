Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre` with the last element removed if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same, `suffZero` includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and the conditions involving `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi`, `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` if `ol <= zr` when `el` is '>', otherwise it is `func_1(preOne, 0)` when `el` is '>', `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` if `ol <= zr` when `el` is '>', otherwise it is `func_1(preOne, 0)` when `el` is '>', `fi` is `pre[0]` if `ol > zr` when `el` is '>', `i` is `i_end - 1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the values of `ol` and `zr`. `ol` is set to `totalOne`, and `zr` is set to `len(suffZero) - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
