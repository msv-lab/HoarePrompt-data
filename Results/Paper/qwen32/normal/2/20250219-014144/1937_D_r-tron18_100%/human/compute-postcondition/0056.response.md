The code snippet updates the value of `ans[i]` based on the calculated values of `zeroInd` and `oneInd`. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are part of the calculation for `zeroInd` or `oneInd`.

Given the initial state, the value of `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd`. The other variables (`s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, `fi`, `i`) retain their previous values unless they are part of the calculation.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a positive integer; `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre` with the last element removed if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `suffZero` includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is `zeroInd - oneInd`; `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`; `ol` is equal to `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`; `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`; `fi` is `pre[0]` if `ol > zr` when `el` is '>'; `i` is `i_end - 1`.**
