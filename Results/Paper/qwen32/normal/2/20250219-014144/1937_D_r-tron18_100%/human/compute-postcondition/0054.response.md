To determine the new state after executing the given line of code, let's analyze the impact of the code on the variables involved.

The line of code modifies `zeroInd` using the function `func_1` applied to `suffZero` with arguments `ol + 1` and `1`. Here's the updated value of `zeroInd`:

```
zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
```

This line does not affect any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, only `zeroInd` changes.

Given the initial state:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same.
- `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre` with the last element removed if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same.
- `suffZero` includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and the conditions involving `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi`.
- `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`.
- `ol` is equal to `totalOne`.
- `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.
- `zeroInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` if `ol <= zr` when `el` is '>', otherwise it is `func_1(preOne, 0)` when `el` is '>'.
- `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` if `ol <= zr` when `el` is '>', otherwise it is `func_1(preOne, 0)` when `el` is '>'.
- `fi` is `pre[0]` if `ol > zr` when `el` is '>'.
- `i` is `i_end - 1`.

After the execution of the line of code, the only change is in the value of `zeroInd`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a positive integer; `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre` with the last element removed if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `suffZero` includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and the conditions involving `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi`; `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`; `ol` is equal to `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`; `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` if `ol <= zr` when `el` is '>', otherwise it is `func_1(preOne, 0)` when `el` is '>'; `fi` is `pre[0]` if `ol > zr` when `el` is '>'; `i` is `i_end - 1`.**
