To determine the new state after executing the given line of code, we need to focus on the variable `oneInd` and how it changes. The line `oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)` modifies `oneInd` by subtracting the result of `func_1(preOne, 1)` from its current value.

Given the initial state:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same.
- `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre` with the last element removed if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same.
- `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and the conditions involving `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi`.
- `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`.
- `ol` is equal to `totalOne`.
- `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`.
- `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`.
- `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`.
- `fi` is `pre[0]` if `ol > zr` when `el` is '>', `i` is `i_end - 1`.

The line `oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)` updates `oneInd` by subtracting the value of `func_1(preOne, 1)` from its current value.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we can only express the new value of `oneInd` in terms of the function call:

New `oneInd` = `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a positive integer; `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre` with the last element removed if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and the conditions involving `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi`; `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`; `ol` is equal to `totalOne`; `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`; `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`; `fi` is `pre[0]` if `ol > zr` when `el` is '>', `i` is `i_end - 1`.**
