To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the loop head, which includes the variable `i` and the range parameters.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, and the loop iterates from `n-1` down to `0`.

### Analysis:
- The loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration.
- The loop condition is `i >= 0`.
- To proceed to the next iteration, `i` should be decremented by 1.

### Adjustment:
- If `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k-1`.

### Example:
If `i` was `2` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `1`.

### General Case:
If `i` was `i_end` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end - 1`.

### Final State:
Since we are not given the specific value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we denote it as `i_end`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end - 1`.

### Conclusion:
The only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment is `i`. All other variables (`s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, `fi`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre` with the last element removed if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same, `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and the conditions involving `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi`, `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `totalOne`, `zr` is 0 if `el` is '>', otherwise it is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` if `ol <= zr` when `el` is '>', otherwise it is `func_1(preOne, 0)` when `el` is '>', `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` if `ol <= zr` when `el` is '>', otherwise it is `func_1(preOne, 0)` when `el` is '>', `fi` is `pre[0]` if `ol > zr` when `el` is '>', `i` is `i_end - 1`**
