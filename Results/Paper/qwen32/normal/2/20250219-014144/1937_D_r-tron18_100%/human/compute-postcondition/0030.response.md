To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the expression `zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`.

Given:
- `suffZero` is a list.
- `ol` is equal to `totalOne`.
- `func_1` is presumably a function that takes a list and an index and returns some value from that list based on the index.

Let's denote:
- `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` as `value1`.
- `func_1(suffZero, 1)` as `value2`.

Then the expression becomes:
- `zeroInd = 2 * value1 - value2`.

Since the exact definition of `func_1` is not provided, we'll assume it simply retrieves the element at the specified index from the list `suffZero`.

Thus:
- `value1 = suffZero[ol + 1]`
- `value2 = suffZero[1]`

Therefore:
- `zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[ol + 1] - suffZero[1]`

The other variables (`s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`) remain unchanged unless they are directly modified within the code snippet, which they are not.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list that now includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`, and `el` is not equal to '>'; `ol` is equal to `totalOne`; `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * suffZero[ol + 1] - suffZero[1]`.**
