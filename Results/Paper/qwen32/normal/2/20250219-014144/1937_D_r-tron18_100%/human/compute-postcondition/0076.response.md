To determine the output state, we need to focus on the impact of the line `oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` on the existing variables.

Given:
- `oneInd` is initially not defined in the initial state, but it will be set in the code.
- `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'.
- `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.

Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot compute its exact output. However, we can infer that `oneInd` will be twice the result of `func_1(preOne, zr)`.

Let's summarize the output state:

- `s1` remains a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `pre` remains a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` remains adjusted based on the value of `el`.
- `preOne` remains a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'.
- `suffZero` remains `[0, 1]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + 1`.
- `ans` remains a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and the conditions involving `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi`.
- `el` remains the character at index `i` of `s1`.
- `ol` remains equal to `totalOne`.
- `zr` remains `len(suffZero) - 1`.
- `fi` remains `pre[0]` if `ol > zr` when `el` is '>'.
- `i` remains `0`.
- `el` remains `s1[0]`.
- `zeroInd` remains `1` if `el` is '>', otherwise `zeroInd` remains `3`.
- `oneInd` is now `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`.
