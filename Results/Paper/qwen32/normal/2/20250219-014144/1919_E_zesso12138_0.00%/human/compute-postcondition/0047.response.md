Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a` such that `|p_i| <= n` for all `i`, and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `dp` is a list of `2 * n + 1` integers, where at least one element `dp[j]` is greater than 0; `offset` is `n`; `new_dp` is a list of `2 * n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0 except `new_dp[j + 1]` which is `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`. Specifically, `new_dp[5]` is `(new_dp[5] + dp[4]) % MOD` since `j + 1` (which is 5) is less than or equal to `2 * n`. `j` is 4.**
