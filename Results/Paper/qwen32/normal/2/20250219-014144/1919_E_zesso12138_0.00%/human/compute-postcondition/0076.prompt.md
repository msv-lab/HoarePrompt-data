Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a` such that `|p_i| <= n` for all `i`, and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `dp` is a list of `2 * n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0; `offset` is `n`; `new_dp` is a list of `2 * n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2 * n + 1):
    if dp[j] > 0:
        if j + 1 <= 2 * n:
            new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
        if j - 1 >= 0:
            new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a` such that `|p_i| <= n` for all `i`, and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `dp` is a list of `2 * n + 1` integers, with `dp[j]` being greater than 0 if the condition `dp[j] > 0` is true, and all other elements of `dp` are initialized to 0; `offset` is `n`; `new_dp` is a list of `2 * n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0 except `new_dp[0]` which is `(new_dp[0] + dp[1]) % MOD` if `j` is hypothetically 1 (though this does not affect the current state since `j` is 0); `j` is 0. Since the condition `dp[j] > 0` is false (as `j` is 0 and `dp[0]` is 0), the state remains unchanged from the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a` such that `|p_i| <= n` for all `i`, and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `dp` is a list of `2 * n + 1` integers, with `dp[j]` being greater than 0 if the condition `dp[j] > 0` is true, and all other elements of `dp` are initialized to 0; `offset` is `n`; `new_dp` is a list of `2 * n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0 except `new_dp[0]` which is `(2 * dp[1]) % MOD` and `new_dp[2]` which is `dp[1] % MOD` if `j + 1 <= 2 * n`; `j` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a` such that `|p_i| <= n` for all `i`, and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `dp` is a list of `2 * n + 1` integers, with `dp[j]` being greater than 0 if the condition `dp[j] > 0` is true, and all other elements of `dp` are initialized to 0; `offset` is `n`; `new_dp` is a list of `2 * n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0 except `new_dp[0]` which is `(2 * dp[1]) % MOD`, `new_dp[2]` which is `dp[1] % MOD` if `j + 1 <= 2 * n`, and if `dp[j] > 0`, then `new_dp[3]` which is `(new_dp[3] + dp[2]) % MOD` if `j + 1 <= 2 * n`, and `new_dp[1]` which is `(new_dp[1] + dp[2]) % MOD` if `j - 1 >= 0`; `j` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
