To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which in this case is `_ in range(t)`. The loop will execute if `t` is a positive integer because `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 up to, but not including, `t`.

Given the provided state:
- `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array `a`.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a`, where `|p_i| <= n` for all `i`, and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line.
- `index` is 1.
- `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.
- `results` is an empty list.

The only variable in the loop head is `t`. To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be a positive integer. The other variables (`n`, `p`, `data`, `index`, and `results`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `t` is a positive integer.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `results` is an empty list**
