The code snippet updates the list `p` by mapping each element in the slice `data[index:index + n]` to an integer. This means that `p` now contains the integer values of the strings in the specified slice of `data`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`.
- `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`.
- `data` is a list of strings.
- `index` is `4 + 2 * n`.
- `t` is 1.
- `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.
- `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.

After executing the code snippet, `p` is reassigned to the list of integers obtained from slicing `data` from `index` to `index + n` and converting each element to an integer.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]` where each element is converted to an integer; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `4 + 2 * n`; `t` is 1; `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the return value of `func_1(n, p)`; `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**.
