The given code snippet only initializes a variable `index` to 0. None of the other variables (`n`, `p`, `data`) are modified by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same except for the new variable `index`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a`, where `|p_i| <= n` for all `i`, and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line; `index` is 0.**
