The given code snippet reassigns the variable `result` to the return value of the function `func_1(n, p)`. Since `result` already held the return value of `func_1(n, p)` before this line, executing this line does not change the value of `result`. Therefore, the state of `result` remains the same.

Here is the Output State:

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]` where each element is converted to an integer; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `4 + 2 * n + n`; `t` is 1; `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the return value of `func_1(n, p)`; `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**. 

In simpler terms, the state remains unchanged except for the fact that `result` is explicitly set to the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, which it already was.
