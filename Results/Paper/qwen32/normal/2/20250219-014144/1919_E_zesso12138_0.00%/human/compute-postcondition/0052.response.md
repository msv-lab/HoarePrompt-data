Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a` such that `|p_i| <= n` for all `i`, and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `dp` is a list of `2 * n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0; `offset` is `n`; `new_dp` is a list of `2 * n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0.**

Explanation: The variable `dp` is now assigned the same list as `new_dp`, which means `dp` also contains `2 * n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0. All other variables retain their original values and conditions.
