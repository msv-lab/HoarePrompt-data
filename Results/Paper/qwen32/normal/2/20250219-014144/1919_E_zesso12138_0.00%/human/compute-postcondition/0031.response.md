To determine what will be printed when the `print(res)` statement is executed, let's analyze the given initial state:

- `n` is the size of the last array `p` processed.
- `p` is the last array of integers derived from `data`.
- `data` is a list of strings.
- `index` is `1 + t + sum of sizes of all arrays p`, where `t` is 0.
- `results` is a list containing at least three elements, e.g., `results` is `[some_value1, some_value2, some_value3]`.
- `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration.
- `res` is the third element of `results`.

Given this information, we need to focus on the variable `res`. According to the precondition, `res` is explicitly defined as the third element of the list `results`. Since `results` contains at least three elements, `res` will be the value of the third element in that list.

However, the exact value of `res` is not provided in the initial state, so we can only describe it as the third element of the `results` list.

Therefore, the output of the `print(res)` statement will be the third element of the `results` list.

Output: **res (where res is the third element of the results list)**
