Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a`, where `|p_i| <= n` for all `i`, and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line; `index` is 1; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.**

In simple terms, the variable `index` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables retain their initial values.
