To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze its logic against the problem requirements.

The problem requires finding the minimum number of pieces a binary string needs to be cut into, so that the pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

Here's the provided code with some analysis:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: `count` is initialized to 1 because even an empty string or a string with uniform characters (all '0's or all '1's) would require at least one piece.
2. **Loop through the string**: The loop iterates through the string to find transitions from '0' to '1' or '1' to '0'.
3. **Counting Transitions**: Each time a transition is found (`s[j] != s[j + 1]`), `count` is incremented.
4. **Flag Handling**: If a '0' to '1' transition is found (`s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'`), `flag` is set to `True`. However, this flag is only used to potentially decrement `count` by 1 after the loop.
5. **Decrement Count Conditionally**: After the loop, if `flag` is `True`, `count` is decremented by 1. This seems to be an attempt to handle a specific edge case, but it doesn't correctly address the requirement.

### Issues:
- The logic of decrementing `count` based on the `flag` does not correctly account for all scenarios. For example, consider the string "010101". The transitions occur at every position, leading to `count` being 6, and then decrementing by 1 due to the `flag` results in 5, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 3.
- The logic fails to correctly identify the minimal cuts required in more complex scenarios.

### Correct Approach:
The correct approach involves counting the number of transitions from '1' to '0'. Each '1' to '0' transition indicates a necessary cut because it means we have a '1' that needs to be separated from preceding '0's to achieve a sorted order.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        for j in range(1, len(s)):
            if s[j - 1] == '1' and s[j] == '0':
                count += 1
        print(count + 1)  # Add 1 to account for the initial piece

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**
