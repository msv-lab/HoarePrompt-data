The code snippet `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Given the initial state, the only variable affected by this operation is `j`. All other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is a newly input string with length greater than 1; `i` is `len(s)` if `len(s) < t`, otherwise `i` is `(len(s) + 1) % t`; `count` is 4 if `s[j] != s[j + 1]`, otherwise `count` is 3; `flag` is True if `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'`, otherwise `flag` remains False; `j` is now `j + 1` if `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'`, and `j` must be less than `len(s) - 1`. After executing `j += 1`, `j` is incremented by 1.**
