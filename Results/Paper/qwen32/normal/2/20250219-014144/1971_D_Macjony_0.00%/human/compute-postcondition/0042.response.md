Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is the newly input string with length greater than 1; `count` is 2; `flag` is False; `j` is 0; `i` is `len(s)` if `len(s) < t`, otherwise `i` is `(len(s) + 1) % t`. Additionally, the character at index `j` of `s` is '0' and the character at index `j + 1` of `s` is '1'.**
