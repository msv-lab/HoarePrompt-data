Postcondition: **`t` is the same input integer, `s` is a string of length at least 2, `count` is 2, `flag` is True if `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'`, otherwise `flag` remains False, `j` is 1 if `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'`, otherwise `j` remains 0, `i` is the initially calculated value plus 1, and the character at index `j` of `s` is '1' if `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'`, otherwise it remains the character at index `j` of `s`.**
