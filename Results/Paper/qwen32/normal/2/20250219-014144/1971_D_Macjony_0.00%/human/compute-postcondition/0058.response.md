The value of `j` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is a newly input string with length greater than 1; `i` is `len(s)` if `len(s) < t`, otherwise `i` is `(len(s) + 1) % t`; `count` is 4 if `s[j] != s[j + 1]`, otherwise `count` is 3; `flag` is True; `j` is now `j + 1` and must be less than `len(s) - 1`.**
