The code assigns the first element of the list `l` to the variable `a`. Therefore, the value of `a` is now the first element of the list `l`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; `l` is a list of integers read from the second line of input; `a` is the first element of the list `l`.**
