In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the input integer `n`. The loop variable `_` is a common Python convention for a variable whose value is intentionally ignored. Here, the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is the number of test cases.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variable `n`, as it is the only one mentioned in the loop head. The state before the loop should include a valid `n` that is at least 1, as the problem specifies that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5`.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **Variable `n`:** This variable determines how many times the loop will iterate. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1. Since the problem guarantees that `n` will be within the range `[1, 2⋅10^5]`, no further adjustment is needed for `n` itself, but we must ensure it is correctly read from the input.

2. **Loop Variable `_`:** This variable is used to iterate over the range, but its value is ignored in the loop body. Therefore, there is no specific state to adjust for `_`.

3. **Input Handling:** The state should reflect that the input is correctly parsed, meaning `n` is read and is a valid integer within the specified range.

Given these points, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `n` is correctly read and is within the specified range. However, since the problem guarantees that `n` will be within the range, we just need to ensure it is read properly.

State: **`n` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5**

This state ensures that the loop will execute the correct number of times based on the input.
