Given the initial state, `x` is `y + 3`. The line of code `b = l[x]` assigns the value at index `x` of list `l` to variable `b`.

Since `x` is `y + 3`, `b` will take the value of the element at index `y + 3` in the list `l`.

Therefore, the output state includes the new variable `b` with its value derived from the list `l` at the specified index.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, and `y` remain unchanged; `x` is `y + 3`; `b` is `l[y + 3]`.**
