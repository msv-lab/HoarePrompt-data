Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `y` is 0, `l` is the list of integers read from the input, `a` is `l[0]`, `b` is the first `l[y]` that is greater than `l[y-1]` if such a pair exists, otherwise `b` is `0`, `c` is `0`. Additionally, `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, and `l[x] - a < l[x] - b`.**
