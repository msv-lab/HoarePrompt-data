Postcondition: **`y` is any integer, `n` must be greater than `y + 1`. The element `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, and the current value of `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`. If `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, then `a` is equal to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is equal to `l[x]` and `a - l[x]` is greater than `b - l[x]`.**
