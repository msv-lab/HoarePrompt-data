To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

Initial State: 
- `y` is any integer
- `n` is greater than `y + 2`
- `x` is `y + 3`

Code Snippet:
```python
b = l[x]
```

This line of code assigns the value at index `x` of the list `l` to the variable `b`.

Since `x` is `y + 3`, the value of `b` will be `l[y + 3]`. No other variables are modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`y` is any integer, `n` is greater than `y + 2`, `x` is `y + 3`, `b` is `l[y + 3]`**

In natural language, the output state means that `y` remains any integer, `n` is still greater than `y + 2`, `x` remains `y + 3`, and a new variable `b` is introduced with the value of the element at index `y + 3` in the list `l`.
