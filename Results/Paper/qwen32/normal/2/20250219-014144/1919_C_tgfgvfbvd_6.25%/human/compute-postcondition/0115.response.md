Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `y` is 0, `l` is the list of integers read from the input, and `c` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the if condition was met. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 1, `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a` is greater than or equal to `l[x] - b`; otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 0. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`; otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, `a` remains `l[0]` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`; otherwise, `a` becomes `l[0]` and `b` becomes `l[x]`.**
