The only variable in the loop head is `x`. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` was `y + 2`, and `n` is greater than `y + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `y + 3`. The variable `n` does not need to be adjusted since it remains the same throughout the loop.

State: **`y` is any integer, `n` is greater than `y + 2`, `x` is `y + 3`**
