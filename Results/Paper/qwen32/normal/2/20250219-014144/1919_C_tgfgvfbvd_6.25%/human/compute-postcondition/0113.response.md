Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `y` is 0, `l` is the list of integers read from the input, `c` is 0. If `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, then `a` remains `l[x]` and `b` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `a` is `l[0]`, `b` becomes `l[x]`, and `l[x]` is less than `a` but not less than `b`.**
