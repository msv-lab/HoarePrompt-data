The code snippet `n = int(input())` changes the value of `n` to whatever integer is input by the user. The values of `l`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `l` is unchanged, `a` is the smallest element in `l[y+1:n]` that meets the loop's conditions, `b` is the largest element in `l[y+1:n]` that meets the loop's conditions, `c` is the count of elements in `l[y+1:n]` that are greater than both `a` and `b` at the time they are encountered.**
