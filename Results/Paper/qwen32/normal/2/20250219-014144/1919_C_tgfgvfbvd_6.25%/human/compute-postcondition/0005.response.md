The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `c` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `l`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of `c` with a value of 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; `l` is a list of integers read from the second line of input; `a` is the first element of the list `l`; `b` is 0; `c` is 0.**
