Given the initial state, `x` is defined as `y + 2`. The line `a = l[x]` assigns to `a` the value at index `x` of the list `l`.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `l` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `x` is `y + 2`, `a` is `l[y + 2]`**.

This means that the value of `a` is now the element in the list `l` at the position specified by `x`, which is `y + 2`. All other variables remain as they were initially.
