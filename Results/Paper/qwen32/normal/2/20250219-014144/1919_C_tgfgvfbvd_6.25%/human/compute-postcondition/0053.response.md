Given the initial state and the code snippet, we can determine the new state after the code executes.

Initial State: `n` is unchanged, `l` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `x` is `y + 2`
Code Snippet: `b = l[x]`

The code snippet assigns the value of `l[x]` to `b`. Since `x` is defined as `y + 2`, `b` will be assigned the value of the element at index `y + 2` in the list `l`.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `l` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `x` is `y + 2`, `b` is `l[y + 2]`**

This means that after the code executes, `n`, `l`, and `y` remain the same, `x` remains `y + 2`, and a new variable `b` is introduced with the value of the element at index `y + 2` in the list `l`.
