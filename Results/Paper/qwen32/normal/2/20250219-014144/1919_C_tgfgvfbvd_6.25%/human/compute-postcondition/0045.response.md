Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: `n` is unchanged, `l` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `x` is `y + 2`

Code Snippet:
```python
a = l[x]
```

Impact of the Code:
- The variable `a` is assigned the value of the element at index `x` in the list `l`.
- Since `x` is defined as `y + 2`, the value of `a` will be `l[y + 2]`.

Therefore, the updated state includes the new variable `a` with the value `l[y + 2]`. The other variables (`n`, `l`, `y`, `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `l` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `x` is `y + 2`, `a` is `l[y + 2]`**
