The only variables in the loop head are `x`, `y`, and `n`. Since `n` and `l` are stated as unchanged, we only need to adjust `x` and `y`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `y` must be less than `n-1`. The loop iterates over the range from `y + 1` to `n`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `x` should be incremented by 1, and `y` should remain the same because `y` is the starting point of the range for `x`.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `x` should be `y + 2` (since `x` was `y + 1` at the end of the previous iteration and it gets incremented by 1).
- `y` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`n` is unchanged, `l` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `x` is `y + 2`**
