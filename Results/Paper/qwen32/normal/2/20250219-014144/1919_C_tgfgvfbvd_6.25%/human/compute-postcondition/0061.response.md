The code snippet provided only increments the variable `c` by 1. The values of `n`, `l`, `y`, `x`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged according to the problem statement.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, and `y` remain unchanged; `x` is `y + 3`; If `l[y + 3] - a >= l[y + 3] - b`, then `a` is set to `l[y + 3]`; Otherwise, `b` is set to `l[y + 3]`; `c` is incremented by 1.**
