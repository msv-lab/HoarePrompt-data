Postcondition: **`y` is any integer, `n` must be greater than `y + 1`. The element `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`. Additionally, `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, meaning `l[x]` is either greater than or equal to `a` or greater than or equal to `b`. The current value of `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`.**
