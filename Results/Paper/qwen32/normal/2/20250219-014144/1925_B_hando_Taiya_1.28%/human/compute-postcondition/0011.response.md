Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x ≤ 10⁸, and `ans` is updated based on the divisibility of `x` by `i`. If `x` is divisible by `i` and `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, `ans` is set to `max(0, i)`. If `x` is divisible by `i` and `n` is greater than `x // i` but less than or equal to `i`, `ans` is set to `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
