Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x ≤ 10⁸.
- `i` is 5.
- `ans` is updated based on certain conditions related to divisibility of `x` by `i`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
ans = max(ans, i)
```

### Impact Analysis:
- The code updates the variable `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`.
- Since `i` is fixed at 5, `ans` will be updated to be at least 5 if it was previously less than 5.

### Output State:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `x` and `n` remain integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x ≤ 10⁸.
- `i` remains 5.
- `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and 5.

### Natural Language Description:
The value of `ans` is updated to be at least 5, while the values of `t`, `x`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x ≤ 10⁸, `i` is 5, `ans` is the maximum of its current value and 5.**
