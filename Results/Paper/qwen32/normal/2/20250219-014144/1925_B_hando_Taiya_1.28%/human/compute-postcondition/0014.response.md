Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x ≤ 10⁸, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `x // 4`, `i` is 4**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` is now the maximum of its previous value and the result of integer division of `x` by 4. All other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, and `i`) retain their original values.
