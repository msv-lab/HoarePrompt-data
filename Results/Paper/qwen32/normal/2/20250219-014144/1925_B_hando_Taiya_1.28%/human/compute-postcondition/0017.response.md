Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x ≤ 10⁸, `i` is 4. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and 4 if `n` is less than or equal to `x // 4`; `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `x // 4` if `n` is greater than `x // 4` and less than or equal to 4; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, `ans` remains unchanged.**
