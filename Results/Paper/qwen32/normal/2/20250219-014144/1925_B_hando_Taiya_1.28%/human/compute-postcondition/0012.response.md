To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and the implicit upper limit `isqrt(x) + 1`.

Given:
- The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `isqrt(x) + 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` had a specific value.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

Other variables like `t`, `x`, `n`, and `ans` are not part of the loop head and thus should remain unchanged.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration (`i_prev`).
2. Increment `i` by 1 to get the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration (`i_next = i_prev + 1`).
3. Ensure that `i_next` is still within the bounds of the loop (i.e., `1 <= i_next <= isqrt(x) + 1`).

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, let's assume it was `i_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x ≤ 10⁸, `ans` is updated based on the divisibility of `x` by `i`, `i` is `i_prev + 1` where `i_prev` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

However, to provide a concrete example, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be 4.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x ≤ 10⁸, `ans` is updated based on the divisibility of `x` by `i`, `i` is 4**.

If we don't know the exact value of `i_prev`, the most general form of the answer would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x ≤ 10⁸, `ans` is updated based on the divisibility of `x` by `i`, `i` is `i_prev + 1` where `i_prev` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

But typically, if we need a specific example, we can assume `i_prev` to be a specific value, say 3, leading to:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x ≤ 10⁸, `ans` is updated based on the divisibility of `x` by `i`, `i` is 4**.
