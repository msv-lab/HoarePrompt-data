You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), followed by two binary strings of length n, representing the rows of the 2xN grid. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: a is a list containing two elements: the first element is the integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), and the second element is a binary string of length `n`.
    s = []
    x = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1':
            y = i
        
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: If the loop breaks at iteration `k`, then `s` is `a[0][:k + 1] + a[1][k:]`, `x` is `k`, and `y` is the last value it was set to before the loop broke. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, then `s` is `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]`, `x` is `n - 1`, and `y` is the last index where `a[0][i + 1] == '0'` and `a[1][i] == '1'`.
    t = 1
    for i in range(y, x):
        if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: s is a[0] + a[1][n - 1], x is n - 1, y is the last index where a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1', t is 1.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: a[0]a[1][n - 1] (where a[0] is the first element of the list a and a[1][n - 1] is the last element of the second element of the list a)
    print(t)
    #This is printed: 1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and two binary strings of length `n`, representing the rows of a 2xN grid. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the configuration of the binary strings. The total sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
