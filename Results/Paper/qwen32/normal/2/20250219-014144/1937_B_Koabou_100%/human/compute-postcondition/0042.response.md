The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop iterates over the range from `y` to `x`, meaning `i` will take values starting from `y` up to, but not including, `x`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration is `y` must be less than `x`, it implies that there are still values for `i` to take within this range for the loop to continue executing.

To prepare for the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. The other variables (`y`, `x`, `a`, `s`, `t`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be modified based on the given instructions.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`y` must be less than `x`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since we don't have specific values for `y` and `x` other than their relationship, we can't provide exact values, but we know `i` should be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Final Answer:
State: **`y` must be less than `x`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
