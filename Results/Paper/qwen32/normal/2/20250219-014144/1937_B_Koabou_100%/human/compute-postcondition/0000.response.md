The given code snippet only initializes an empty list `a`. No other variables are affected, and no operations are performed that would change the initial state of `n` or the binary strings.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), followed by two binary strings of length n, representing the rows of the 2xN grid. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `a` is an empty list.**
