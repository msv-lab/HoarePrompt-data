Postcondition: **`a` is a list containing two elements where the first element `n` is at least 3, and the second element is a binary string of length `n`. If `a[0][3] == '1' and a[1][2] == '0'`, then `s` is `a[0][:3] + a[1][2:]` and `x` is 2. Otherwise, `s` remains as it was and `x` remains as it was. `y` remains unchanged. `i` is 2.**
