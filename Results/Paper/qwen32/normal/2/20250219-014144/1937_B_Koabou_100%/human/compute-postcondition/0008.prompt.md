Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), followed by two binary strings of length `n`, representing the rows of the 2xN grid. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `a` is an empty list. `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(2):
    a.append(input())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), followed by two binary strings of length `n`, representing the rows of the 2xN grid. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list containing the first input line.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list containing two elements: the first element is the integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), and the second element is a binary string of length `n`; `_` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list containing three elements: the first element is the integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), the second element is a binary string of length `n`, and the third element is a string obtained from the input; `_` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
