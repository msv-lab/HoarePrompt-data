Postcondition: **`a` is a list containing two elements where the first element `n` is at least 2, and the second element is a binary string of length `n`. `s` is an empty list; `x` is 0; `y` is 0. Additionally, the current index `i` satisfies the condition that `a[0][i + 1]` is '0' and `a[1][i]` is '1'.**
