Postcondition: **`shapes` is either 2 or 3 depending on whether the count of integer `j_next` in the dictionary `d` was initially less than 3 or greater than or equal to 3, respectively; `w` has been decreased by 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers from the input that must contain at least one integer; `pl` is a list of unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must contain at least one integer; `d` is a dictionary with counts of each unique integer in `palka`; `j` is the next element in `pl` after the current `j`. If `d[j] >= 3`, then `shapes` is set to 3. Otherwise, `shapes` remains 2.**
