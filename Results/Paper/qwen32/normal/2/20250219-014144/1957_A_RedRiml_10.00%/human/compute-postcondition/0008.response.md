The code snippet `d[i] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. Given that the initial state specifies that `d` is an empty dictionary or a dictionary that does not contain the key `i`, the dictionary `d` will now have the key `i` with the value `1`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one integer; `pl` is an empty list; `d` is a dictionary containing the key `i` with the value `1`.**
