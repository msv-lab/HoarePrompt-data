The code appends the current value of `i` to the list `pl`. This means that the length of `pl` increases by one, and the last element of `pl` is now `i`.

Given the initial state, the following variables remain unchanged:
- `shapes` is 0
- `w` has been decreased by 1 (its exact value is not specified, but it remains decreased by 1)
- `ln` is an input integer
- `palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 integers
- `i` is the next element in `palka` after the current `i`
- If `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, then `d` now has `i` mapped to `1`. Otherwise, the value of `d[i]` is increased by 1.

The only change is that `pl` now includes the element `i` at its end.

Output State: **`shapes` is 0, `w` has been decreased by 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the next element in `palka` after the current `i`, `pl` has `i` appended to it, and if `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, then `d` now has `i` mapped to `1`; otherwise, the value of `d[i]` is increased by 1.**
