The given code snippet modifies the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. Since `d.get(i)` is not `None`, it means that the key `i` already exists in the dictionary `d` with some value. The operation `d[i] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `i` by 1.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- For each test case, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remains unchanged.
- `w` remains an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `ln` remains an input integer.
- `palka` remains a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one integer.
- `pl` remains an empty list.
- `d` is a dictionary where the value associated with the key `i` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one integer; `pl` is an empty list; `d` is a dictionary and `d[i]` is incremented by 1.**
