To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `shapes` is defined as the total number of unique elements in the list `pl` that have a count of 3 or more.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(shapes)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding `shapes`:**
   - `shapes` is derived from the list `pl`.
   - It counts the number of unique elements in `pl` that appear 3 times or more.
   - Without knowing the exact contents of `pl`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `shapes`.

2. **Output Description:**
   - The `print(shapes)` statement will output the value of `shapes`.
   - Since the exact value of `shapes` depends on the contents of `pl`, we can only describe it in terms of the definition provided.

### Conclusion:
The `print(shapes)` statement will output the number of unique elements in the list `pl` that have a count of 3 or more.

Output: **shapes (where shapes is the total number of unique elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more)**
