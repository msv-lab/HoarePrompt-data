To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior:

The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `palka`. For each element `i`:
- It checks if `i` is already a key in the dictionary `d`. If not, it adds `i` to `d` with a value of 1. If `i` is already a key in `d`, it increments the value associated with `i` by 1.
- It also checks if `i` is in the list `pl`. If not, it appends `i` to `pl`.

After the loop has processed all elements in `palka`, the final state will be:
- `pl` will contain all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared.
- `d` will contain each unique element from `palka` as keys, with their corresponding values representing how many times each element appears in `palka`.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input; `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `palka` and each value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `pl` will have all unique elements from `palka` in the order they were first encountered, and `d` will have a count of how many times each element appears in `palka`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `ln`) remain unchanged.
