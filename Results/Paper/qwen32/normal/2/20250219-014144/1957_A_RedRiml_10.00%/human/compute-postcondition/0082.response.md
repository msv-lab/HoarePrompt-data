The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `ln`. This means `ln` will take on the integer value provided by the user input. The variables `shapes` and `w` are not affected by this line of code.

Given that `w` was initially decreased by 1, its new value is one less than its original value. The variable `shapes` retains its original value as it is not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`shapes` is the total number of unique elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more, `w` is decreased by 1, `ln` is an input integer.**
