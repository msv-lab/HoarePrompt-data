Postcondition: **`shapes` is 0, `w` has been decreased by 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 integer, and `d` is a dictionary. If `i` is not in `pl`, `pl` remains unchanged. If `i` is not in `pl` and `d.get(i)` was `None`, `d` now contains the key-value pair `{i: 1}`. Otherwise, the value associated with the key `i` in `d` is incremented by 1. If `i` is already in `pl`, `pl` and `d` remain unchanged.**
