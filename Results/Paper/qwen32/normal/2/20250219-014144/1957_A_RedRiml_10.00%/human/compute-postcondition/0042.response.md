The code snippet `ln = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `ln`. This means the value of `ln` changes to whatever integer is provided by the user input. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `ln` is an input integer (newly assigned); `palka` is a list of integers read from the input; `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `palka` and each value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`; `shapes` is the count of unique elements in `palka` that appear at least 3 times; `w` is decremented by 1.**
