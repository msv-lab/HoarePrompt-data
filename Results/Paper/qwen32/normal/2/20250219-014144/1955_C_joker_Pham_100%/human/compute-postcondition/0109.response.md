Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]` and each other integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. If `a[r]` is 0, then `k` is now `k - 2 * a[l]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and `r` is decremented by 1. If `a[r]` is not 0, no changes are made to `k`, `sunks`, or `r`; `sunks` is incremented by 1; `l` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, the state of all variables remains the same as described in the initial state.
