Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k >= a[r] * 2`, then `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r]`, `k` is now `k - a[r] * 2`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and if `a[l] == 0`, `sunks` is incremented by 1 again and `l` is incremented by 1; `r` is decremented by 1. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k < a[r] * 2`, then if `a[r] * 2 == k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and the loop breaks; otherwise, the loop breaks without changing any variables. If `a[r] >= a[l]`, no changes are made to `k`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, `l`, `r`, or `sunks`.**
