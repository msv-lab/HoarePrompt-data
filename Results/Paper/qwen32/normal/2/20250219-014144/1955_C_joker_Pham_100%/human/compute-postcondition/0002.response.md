To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the condition `l <= r`.

Given:
- `l` is 0
- `r` is `n - 1`

The loop condition `l <= r` will be true as long as `0 <= n - 1`, which simplifies to `n >= 1`. Since the problem states that `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`, this condition is already satisfied for any valid input.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed to the values of `l` and `r` for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `sunks` is 0**
