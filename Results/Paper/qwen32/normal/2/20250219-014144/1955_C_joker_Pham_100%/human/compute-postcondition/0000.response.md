Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1.**

In simple terms, the output state is the same as the initial state except that two new variables `l` and `r` have been introduced and assigned the values 0 and `n - 1`, respectively. All other conditions and variable constraints remain unchanged.
