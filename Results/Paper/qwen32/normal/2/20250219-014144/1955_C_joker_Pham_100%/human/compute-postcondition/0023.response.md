Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is either 0 or an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `l` is equal to its previous value plus 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on whether `a[r]` became 0, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, `k` is now `k - a[l] * 2`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - a[l]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, all variables retain their updated values from the previous operations described in the initial state.
