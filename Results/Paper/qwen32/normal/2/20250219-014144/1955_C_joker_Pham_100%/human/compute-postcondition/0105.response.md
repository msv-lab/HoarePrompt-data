The given code snippet decrements the variable `r` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `k`, and `sunks`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]` and each other integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `l` must be less than or equal to `r`; `k` is now `k - 2 * a[l]`; `sunks` is incremented by 1; `r` is decremented by 1.**
