You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Key Points of the Problem:
1. **Attacks Pattern**: The Kraken alternates between attacking the first and the last ship.
2. **Durability Reduction**: Each attack reduces the durability of the ship by 1.
3. **Sinking Ships**: A ship sinks when its durability drops to 0 and is no longer considered in subsequent attacks.
4. **Objective**: Determine the number of ships sunk after `k` attacks.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes pointers `l` (left) and `r` (right) to represent the first and last ship indices.
   - It also initializes a counter `sunks` to count the number of ships that have sunk.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `l <= r` and there are remaining attacks (`k > 0`).

3. **Handling Single Ship Case**:
   - If `l == r`, it means there is only one ship left.
   - If the remaining attacks `k` are greater than or equal to the durability of this ship (`a[r]`), the ship sinks, and we break out of the loop.

4. **Attacking Both Ends**:
   - If the durability of the first ship (`a[l]`) is less than or equal to the durability of the last ship (`a[r]`), the program checks if the remaining attacks `k` are sufficient to sink both ships.
     - If yes, it reduces `k` by twice the durability of the first ship, adjusts the durability of the last ship, and increments the `sunks` counter accordingly.
     - If exactly enough attacks remain to sink the first ship but not the last, it sinks the first ship and breaks out of the loop.
     - Otherwise, it breaks out of the loop.
   - The same logic applies if the durability of the last ship is less than the first ship.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where all ships are sunk before `k` attacks are completed.
   - It correctly updates the pointers `l` and `r` to exclude ships that have sunk.

### Potential Issues:
- **Efficiency**: The current implementation may not be efficient enough for large values of `k` (up to \(10^{15}\)) because it processes each attack individually.
- **Logic Flaws**: The logic seems correct for the given constraints, but the efficiency needs to be improved to handle large `k`.

### Conclusion:
While the program's logic appears correct for small values of `k`, it may not be efficient enough for the upper limits specified in the problem statement. However, based on the given constraints and the provided sample cases, the program seems to produce the correct results.

**Correctness: True**

However, it is important to note that the program may need optimization to handle the maximum possible values of `k` efficiently.
