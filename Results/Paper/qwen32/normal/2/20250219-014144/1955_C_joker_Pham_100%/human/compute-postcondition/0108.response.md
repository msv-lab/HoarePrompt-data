Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]` and each other integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. If `a[r]` is 0, then `k` is now `k - 2 * a[l]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and `r` is decremented by 1. If `a[r]` is not 0, no changes are made to `k`, `sunks`, or `r`; `sunks` is incremented by 1; `l` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `l` has been incremented by 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `r`, `k`, `sunks`) remain unchanged unless further operations modify them.
