The given code snippet contains a `continue` statement, which means that the current iteration of the loop will be skipped, and the control will move to the next iteration. However, there are no changes made to any variables before the `continue` statement is encountered. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `k`, `sunks`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Additionally, `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`. The current value of `k` is such that `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2` minus `a[r] * 2`. If `a[l]` is equal to 0, then `sunks` is incremented by 1 and `l` is incremented by 1. `sunks` is incremented by 1. `r` is decremented by 1.**
