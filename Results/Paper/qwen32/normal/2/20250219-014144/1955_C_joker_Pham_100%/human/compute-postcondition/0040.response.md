Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Additionally, `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`. The current value of `k` is such that `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2` minus `a[r] * 2`. `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r]` and `a[l]` is equal to 0.**
