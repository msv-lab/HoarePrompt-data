Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is either 0 or an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `l` is equal to its previous value plus 1 if `k >= a[l] * 2`, otherwise `l` remains unchanged. `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on whether `a[r]` became 0 if `k >= a[l] * 2`, otherwise `r` remains `n - 1`. If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]` and `k >= a[l] * 2`, then `k` is reduced by `a[l] * 2`, `a[r]` is reduced by `a[l]`, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]` and `k < a[l] * 2`, then `sunks` is set to 1 and the loop breaks if `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k` or if `l` equals `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`. Otherwise, `sunks` remains 0. If `a[l]` is greater than `a[r]`, no changes are made to `l`, `r`, `k`, `a`, or `sunks`.**
