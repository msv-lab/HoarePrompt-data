Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. If `l` was equal to `r`, then `r` is decremented by 1 to ensure `l <= r`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l` was not equal to `r`, no adjustments are made to `l` or `r`. If `a[l] <= a[r]`, and `k >= a[l] * 2`, then `k` is now `k - a[l] * 2`, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]`, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[r]` becomes 0, `sunks` is incremented by 1 again and `r` is decremented by 1. `l` is incremented by 1. If `a[l] <= a[r]` and `k < a[l] * 2`, then if `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement without changing `sunks`. If `a[l] > a[r]`, no changes are made to `k`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, `l`, `r`, or `sunks`. If `k` equals 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
