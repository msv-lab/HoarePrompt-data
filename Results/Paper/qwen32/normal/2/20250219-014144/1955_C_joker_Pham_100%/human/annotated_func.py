#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    #State: `l > r`, `k` is reduced to a non-positive value or a value less than the smallest possible operation cost, `sunks` reflects the total number of successful operations, and `a` has some elements potentially modified or set to 0.
    return sunks
    #The program returns the total number of successful operations, which is represented by the variable `sunks`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (the number of elements in the list `a`), `k` (a threshold value), and `a` (a list of `n` integers). It performs operations to reduce `k` by subtracting twice the smaller element between the first and last elements of the list `a`, adjusting the list accordingly, and counts the number of successful operations. The function returns the total count of these successful operations.
