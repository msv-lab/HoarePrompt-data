The given code snippet reassigns the value of `p` using the formula `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`. Since `p` was already defined in the initial state, its value is being updated here. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `res`, and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the latest input; `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`; `res` is the count of `a[p]` in `a`; `_` is the current iteration count, incremented by 1**.
