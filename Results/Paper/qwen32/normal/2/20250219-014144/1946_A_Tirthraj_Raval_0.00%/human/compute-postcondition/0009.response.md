The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. The loop does not depend on the values of `n`, `a`, `p`, or `res` for its execution; it simply runs `t` times.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` would have taken on the value of the current iteration count minus one (since Python's `range` is 0-indexed). For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1.

Given that `t` is the total number of iterations, the loop will continue as long as `_` is less than `t`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `_` incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`; `res` is the count of `a[p]` in `a`; `_` is the current iteration count, incremented by 1**
