Reasoning:  
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. However, the current implementation simply counts the occurrences of the median element in the sorted array and prints that count. This count does not indicate how many operations are needed to increase the median.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Sort the array.
2. Identify the median.
3. Determine the minimum number of increments needed to make the median larger than its current value.

Here's a step-by-step outline of the correct approach:
- If the array length \( n \) is odd, the median is the middle element.
- If the array length \( n \) is even, the median is the larger of the two middle elements (as per the problem statement).
- To increase the median, we need to increment elements until the median becomes larger than its current value. This involves finding the smallest elements that need to be incremented to achieve this.

Given the current implementation, it is clear that the logic is incorrect, and thus the program will not produce the correct results for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
