The code snippet provided reassigns the value of `p` using the formula `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`. This means that the value of `p` will be recalculated based on the new input integer `n`.

Given that `p` was previously defined as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, executing the same line of code again does not change its value unless `n` has changed. Since the problem statement indicates that `n` is a new input integer, we assume `n` might have a different value now, thus `p` will be recalculated.

The other variables (`t`, `a`, `res`, `_`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`; `res` is the count of `a[p]` in `a`; `_` is the current iteration count, incremented by 1.**
