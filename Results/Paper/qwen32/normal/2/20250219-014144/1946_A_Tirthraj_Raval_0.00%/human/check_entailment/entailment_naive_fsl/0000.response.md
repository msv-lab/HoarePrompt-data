Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Let's analyze the code and see why it is incorrect.

### Code Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases, sorts the array, and then calculates the position of the median using `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`. However, the core logic of the program is flawed. Instead of calculating the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median, it simply counts the occurrences of the median element in the sorted array.

### Why It Is Incorrect

The goal is to increase the median by performing the minimum number of operations, where each operation increases an element by 1. The current implementation does not attempt to modify the array elements to achieve this goal. Instead, it only counts how many times the current median appears in the sorted array, which is unrelated to the problem's requirement.

### Example of Failure

Consider the following test case:

```
1
3
1 1 1
```

- The median of the array `[1, 1, 1]` is `1`.
- To increase the median, we need to increase at least one element to make the new median greater than `1`.
- The minimum number of operations required is `1` (increase any one of the elements to `2`).

However, the provided program will output `3`, which is the count of the median element `1` in the sorted array, instead of `1`.

### Conclusion

Since the program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to increase the median for the given test cases, it is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness is `False`.
