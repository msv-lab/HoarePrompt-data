The given code snippet updates the variable `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `cnt`. No other variables are modified.

Given the initial state, `ans` is not explicitly mentioned, so we assume it could be any value. After executing the line `ans = max(ans, cnt)`, `ans` will hold the maximum value between its previous value and `cnt`.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a non-empty list, `t` is an empty list, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`, `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is 0, `cnt` is `len(a) // 2`, `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `cnt`.**
