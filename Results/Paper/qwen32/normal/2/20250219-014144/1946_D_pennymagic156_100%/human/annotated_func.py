#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_1`. This function reads a line of input and returns a list of integers.
def func_1():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers derived from splitting a line of input where each element in the list is an integer converted from the split input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into components based on whitespace, converts each component into an integer, and returns a list of these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_2`. Therefore, no precondition can be derived from the given function signature alone.
def func_2():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value that is input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` prompts the user for input, expects an integer value, and returns that integer value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_3`. This function is expected to read input from standard input and return a map object containing integers.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers, which are derived from splitting the input string by whitespace and converting each split component into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a line of input from standard input, splits the input string by whitespace, converts each split component into an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_4()`. Therefore, no specific precondition can be derived from the function signature alone.
def func_4():

    #The program returns the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters and returns a string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, based on user input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the array a, x is a non-negative integer less than \(2^{30}\) representing the favorite number, and a is a list of n non-negative integers each less than \(2^{30}\).

    #The program returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of list `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of integers `a` and a favorite number `x` to determine a value based on bitwise operations. It returns either -1, the length of the list `a`, or the maximum count of certain conditions met during the processing.
