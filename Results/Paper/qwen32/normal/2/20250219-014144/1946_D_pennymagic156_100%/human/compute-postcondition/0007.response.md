Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1`, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> i & 1) for val in a]`. If `u` equals 0 and `v` equals 0, then `n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, `u`, and `v` retain their respective values as described. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged as there is no else part.**
