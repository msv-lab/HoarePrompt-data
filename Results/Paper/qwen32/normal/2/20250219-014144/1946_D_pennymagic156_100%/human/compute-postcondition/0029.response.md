The code snippet `t.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`. Given the initial state, `t` initially contains `[val, val]`. After appending `ai`, `t` will now contain `[val, val, ai]`.

No other variables are modified by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains the same for all other variables.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list with at least two elements, `t` is a list containing `val` as its first element, `val` as its second element, and `ai` as its third element, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` equals 0, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> i & 1) for val in a]` and `v` is even, `op` is `(val >> i) & 1`, `ai` is `val`, `val` is the third element of `a`.**
