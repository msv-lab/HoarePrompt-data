Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. The variable `a` is now the value returned by `func_1()`. `t` is an empty list. `ans` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(29, -1, -1):
    u, v = x >> i & 1, sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])
    if u == v == 0:
        continue
    if u == 0:
        if v % 2:
            return ans
        else:
            op = ai = 0
            for val in a:
                op ^= val >> i & 1
                ai ^= val
                if not op:
                    t.append(ai)
                    ai = 0
            a, t = t, []
    elif v % 2:
        continue
    elif v:
        op = cnt = 0
        for val in a:
            op ^= val >> i & 1
            if not op:
                cnt += 1
        ans = max(ans, cnt)
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list containing `ai` values appended whenever `op` was 0 if `u` equals 0, otherwise `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`. `t` is an empty list. `u` is `(x >> i) & 1`. If `u` equals 0 and `v` (the sum of `[(val >> i & 1) for val in a]`) is even, `v` remains even, and `ans` is -1. If `u` equals 0 and `v` is odd, `v` remains odd, and `ans` is -1. If `u` does not equal 0 and `v` is odd, the state remains as described. If `u` does not equal 0 and `v` is even and not zero, `ans` is `max(-1, cnt)` where `cnt` is the number of times `op` became 0 during the loop, which is at least 1. If `u` does not equal 0 and `v` is 0, `ans` remains -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` contains `ai` values where `op` was 0 during each iteration if `u` equals 0, otherwise `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`. `t` remains an empty list. `u` is `(x >> i) & 1`. `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`. If `u == 0`, no changes are made to `n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `u`, or `v`. If `u != 0`, and `v` is odd, no additional changes are made. If `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is set to 0, `cnt` is set to `len(a) // 2`, and `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `cnt`. If `v` is zero, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` contains the accumulated values of `ai` whenever `op` became 0 during the loop if `u` equals 0, otherwise `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`. `t` remains an empty list. `i` is 28 if `u == v == 0`, otherwise `i` is the length of `a` minus 1 if `v` is non-zero. `u` is the 28th bit of `x` and is not equal to 0 if `v` is non-zero. `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`. If `v % 2` is not equal to 0, no additional changes are made to `i`. If `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is the XOR of all the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a` for `i` ranging from 28 to the length of `a` minus 1, `cnt` is the number of times `op` became 0 during the loop, and `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `cnt`. If `v` is zero, `op`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
