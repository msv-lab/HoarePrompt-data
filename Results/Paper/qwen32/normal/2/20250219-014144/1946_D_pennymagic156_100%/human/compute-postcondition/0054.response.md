Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is `max(-1, cnt)`, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and is not equal to 0, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> i & 1) for val in a]`, `v` is even and not zero, `op` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times `op` became 0 during the loop, which is at least 1.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (-1) and the value of `cnt`. All other variables retain their initial values as they are not modified by the given code snippet.
