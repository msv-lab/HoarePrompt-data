The given code snippet sets `ai` to `0`. This change affects only the variable `ai`, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list containing at least 30 elements, `i` is 28, `u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is the result of `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `t` is a list containing `val` if `op` was initially `False`, otherwise `t` is `[0]`, `ai` is `0`, `val` is the 30th element of `a`.**
