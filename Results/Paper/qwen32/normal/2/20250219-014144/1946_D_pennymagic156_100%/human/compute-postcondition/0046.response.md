The code snippet provided updates the value of `op` using the XOR operation with the bitwise AND of the right-shifted `val` by `i`. Here's the updated state:

- `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`.
- All other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, `u`, `v`, `cnt`, `val`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial conditions:
- `op` was initially `(val >> i & 1)` for some `val` in `a`.
- If `op` was 0, `cnt` was set to 1; otherwise, `cnt` remained 0.
- `val` is the next element in `a`.

After executing the line `op ^= val >> i & 1`, `op` will now hold the result of the XOR operation between its previous value and the new bit extracted from `val`.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()` and has at least one element, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and is not equal to 0, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> i & 1) for val in a]`, `v` is even and not zero, `op` is the result of `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `cnt` is 1 if the initial `op` was 0, otherwise `cnt` remains 0, `val` is the next element in `a`.**
