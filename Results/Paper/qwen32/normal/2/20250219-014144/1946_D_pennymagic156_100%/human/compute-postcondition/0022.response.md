The given code snippet modifies the value of `ai` using the XOR operation with `val`. Here's the updated state:

- `ai` was initially 0.
- `val` is the second element in the list `a`.
- After executing `ai ^= val`, `ai` will now hold the value of `val`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list with at least two elements, `t` is a list containing `ai` if `op` is 0, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` equals 0, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> i & 1) for val in a]` and `v` is even, `op` is 0, `ai` is `val`, `val` is the second element in the list `a`**.
