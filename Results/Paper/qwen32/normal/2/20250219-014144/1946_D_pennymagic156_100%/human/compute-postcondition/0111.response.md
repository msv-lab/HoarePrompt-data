Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` is a list containing `ai` values appended whenever `op` was 0 if `u` equals 0, otherwise `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`. `t` is an empty list. `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` is not equal to 0. `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])` and `v` is even. If `v` is non-zero, `op` is 0, `cnt` is `len(a) // 2`, and `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `cnt`. If `v` is zero, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
