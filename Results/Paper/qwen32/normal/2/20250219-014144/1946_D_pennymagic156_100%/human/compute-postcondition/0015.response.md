The code snippet provided is `ai ^= val`. This operation performs a bitwise XOR between the current value of `ai` and `val`, and assigns the result back to `ai`.

Given the initial state:
- `ai` is 0
- `val` is an element from the list `a` (though its specific value is not provided, we know it exists because `a` has at least one element)

The operation `ai ^= val` will set `ai` to the value of `val` since `ai` starts at 0. The XOR of 0 with any number `val` results in `val`.

Therefore, after executing the code snippet, `ai` will be equal to `val`.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list with at least one element (e.g., `[some_value]`), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` equals 0, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> i & 1) for val in a]` and `v` is even, `op` is 0, `ai` is `val`**.
