The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()` and must contain at least one element, `t` remains an empty list, `i` is 28, `u` is the 28th bit of `x` and is not equal to 0, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a` and is even and non-zero, `op` is the 28th bit of `val` and is 0, `cnt` is 1**.
