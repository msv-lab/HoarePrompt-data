Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Output

    2

    1

    -1

    2
    
Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

# Annotated Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
for _ in range(int(input())):
    print(func_5())

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_1`. This function reads a line of input and returns a list of integers.
def func_1():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers derived from splitting a line of input where each element in the list is an integer converted from the split input.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_2`. Therefore, no precondition can be derived from the given function signature alone.
def func_2():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value that is input by the user.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_3`. This function is expected to read input from standard input and return a map object containing integers.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers, which are derived from splitting the input string by whitespace and converting each split component into an integer.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_4()`. Therefore, no specific precondition can be derived from the function signature alone.
def func_4():
    return input().strip()
    #The program returns the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the array a, x is a non-negative integer less than \(2^{30}\) representing the favorite number, and a is a list of n non-negative integers each less than \(2^{30}\).

    #State: `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list containing the accumulated `ai` values where `op` was 0 during each iteration if `u` equals 0, otherwise `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, and `ans` is the maximum count of times `op` became 0 during the loop when `u != 0` and `v` is even and non-zero.

    #The program returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of list `a`.
