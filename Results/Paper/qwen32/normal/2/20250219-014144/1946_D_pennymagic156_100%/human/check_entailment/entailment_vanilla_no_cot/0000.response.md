Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Logic Error**: The program attempts to solve the problem by iterating over each bit position from the most significant bit to the least significant bit. However, this approach does not correctly handle the constraints and requirements of the problem. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the bitwise OR of the XORs of the segments is less than or equal to `x`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Segments**: The program tries to split the array into segments based on the current bit being considered, but it does not correctly manage the segments to ensure that they meet the criteria specified in the problem statement.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `x` is zero or when the array contains elements that cannot be split into valid segments.

4. **Return Value**: The final return value of the function `func_5` is incorrect. It should return `-1` if no valid segmentation exists, but the current implementation may return an incorrect value in some cases.

To correctly solve the problem, a different approach is needed. One possible solution involves using dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to find the maximum number of valid segments that satisfy the given conditions. The provided code does not implement such an approach, hence it is incorrect.
