Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()` and has at least one element, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and is not equal to 0, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> i & 1) for val in a]`, `v` is even and not zero, `op` is `(val >> i & 1)` for some `val` in `a`. If `op` is 0, `cnt` is 1; otherwise, `cnt` remains 0.**
