The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables directly; it merely changes the flow of the loop.

Given the initial state and the `continue` statement, none of the variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `i`, `u`, `v`) are modified by the `continue` statement. The loop simply proceeds to the next iteration without changing any of these variables.

Therefore, the Output State remains exactly the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` contains `ai` values where `op` was 0 during each iteration if `u` equals 0, otherwise `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`. `t` remains an empty list. `i` is 28. `u` is the 28th bit of `x` and is not equal to 0. `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a` and `v % 2` is not equal to 0.**
