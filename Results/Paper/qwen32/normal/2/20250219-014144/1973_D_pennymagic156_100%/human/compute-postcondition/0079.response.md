To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of calling `func_2()`. However, since the definition of `func_2()` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact changes it might make to the variables `cnt`, `l`, and `i`. 

Given that the function call does not specify any changes to these variables, and without additional information about `func_2()`, we assume that the function does not alter these variables.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`cnt` is `0`, `l` is `n + 1`, and `i` is `1`.**
