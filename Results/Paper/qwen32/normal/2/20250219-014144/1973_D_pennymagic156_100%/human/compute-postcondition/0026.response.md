The code snippet updates the value of `l` by assigning it the result of `func_2() + 1`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `i`, `v`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Since `l` is updated to `func_2() + 1`, and `v` was previously the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration, we can infer that `l` is now `v + 1`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that `n >= k` and `n` is at least 0, `i` is 1, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration, `cnt` is `k`, `l` is `v + 1`.**
