To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the given `for` loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head: `i`, `n`, and the loop's range parameters.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the starting value (`n`) is greater than the stopping value (`0`), considering the step (`-1`). Since `n` is guaranteed to be a positive integer (as per the problem statement \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\)), the loop will definitely execute at least once.

However, the variable `k` is also mentioned as being returned by `func_3()` along with `n`, but it is not directly involved in the loop's execution condition. Therefore, `k` does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

The variable `v` is initialized to `1` and is not part of the loop's execution condition, so it also does not need adjustment.

Thus, the only necessary state to confirm is that `n` is indeed a positive integer, which is already ensured by the problem statement.

Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\); `v` is 1**
