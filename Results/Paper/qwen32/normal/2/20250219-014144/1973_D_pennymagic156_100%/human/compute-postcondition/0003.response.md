To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

- `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, and they are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `v` is set to 1.
- The print statement is `print(f'? 1 {i * n}', flush=True)`.

From the initial state, we know the values of `n` and `k` but not the value of `i`. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can express the output in terms of `i` and `n`.

The print statement formats a string with three parts:
1. The character `'?'`
2. The number `1`
3. The product of `i` and `n`

Given that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\) and `i` is an undefined integer, the output will be a string starting with `'?'`, followed by a space, then `'1'`, another space, and finally the product of `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the output can be described as:
Output: **? 1 i * n (where i is an undefined integer and n is a positive integer between 1 and 10000)**
