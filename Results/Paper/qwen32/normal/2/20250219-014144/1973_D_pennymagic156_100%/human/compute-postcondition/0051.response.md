The value of `cnt` is decremented by 1. The values of `l` and `n` remain unchanged. Since `cnt` must be at least 1 initially, after decrementing, `cnt` must be at least 0. However, since the problem specifies `cnt` must be at least 1, we assume `cnt` was originally greater than 1 to satisfy the condition after decrementing.

Output State: **`cnt` is at least 1 (originally greater than 1), `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and `n` is greater than `l`.**
