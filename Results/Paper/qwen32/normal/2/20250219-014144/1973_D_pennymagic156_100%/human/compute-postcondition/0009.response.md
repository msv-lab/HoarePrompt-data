To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, and the loop's range parameters.

Given:
- The loop iterates from `n` down to `1` (inclusive), decrementing by `1` each time.
- The state at the end of the previous iteration includes `n` and `k` as values returned by `func_3()`, where \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- The variable `v` is mentioned but its value does not affect the loop's iteration directly since it either breaks the loop or remains unchanged based on its comparison with `n`.

Let's analyze the loop:
- The loop starts with `i` initialized to `n`.
- In each iteration, `i` is decremented by `1`.
- The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `1`.

Since the loop decrements `i` by `1` in each iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this decrement.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, say `i_prev`.
2. **Decrement**: Since the loop decrements `i` by `1` in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev - 1`.
3. **Range Check**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `1`. Therefore, `i_prev - 1` must still be within this range.

Given that `i` was `n` at the start of the first iteration, at the start of the second iteration, `i` would be `n - 1`, and so on.

### Conclusion:
If `i` was `n` at the start of the first iteration, at the start of the second iteration, `i` will be `n - 1`. This pattern continues until `i` reaches `1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration, given that `i` was `n` at the start of the first iteration, should be:

State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is \(n - 1\)**

If `i` was already `1` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop would terminate, and there would be no next iteration. However, based on the provided information, we assume that the loop is still active, meaning `i` was greater than `1` at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is \(i - 1\)**

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration except that it was greater than `1`, we generalize it as `i - 1`:

State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is \(i - 1\)**

However, to provide a concrete example, assuming `i` was `n` at the start of the first iteration:

State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is \(n - 1\)**

So, the final answer is:

State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is \(n - 1\)**
