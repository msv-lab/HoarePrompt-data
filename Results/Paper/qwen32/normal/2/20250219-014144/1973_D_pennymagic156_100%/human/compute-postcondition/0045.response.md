To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `cnt` is any non-zero value.
- `l` is set to 1.
- `n` must be greater than 0.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `l`:** 
   - It is explicitly given that `l` is 1.
   
2. **Variables `i` and `v`:**
   - These variables are not defined in the initial state. Therefore, their values are unknown based on the provided information. They could be any values that are defined elsewhere in the code but not mentioned here.

3. **Expression `i * v`:**
   - Since the values of `i` and `v` are unknown, the expression `i * v` also cannot be evaluated to a specific number.

### Conclusion:
Given the lack of explicit values for `i` and `v`, the output will include these variables in their symbolic form. The `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is immediately flushed to the console, but it does not affect the content of the output string.

### Final Output:
Output: **? 1 i * v (where i and v are undefined variables)**
