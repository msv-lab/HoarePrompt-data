The value of `cnt` is decremented by 1. Given that `cnt` was initially `k - 1`, after decrementing, `cnt` becomes `k - 2`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `i`, `v`, `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that `n >= k` and `n` is at least 0, `k` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration, `cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` is the value returned by `func_2()` + 1.**
