The given code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `v`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `i`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `v`. However, we know that `v` was previously equal to `n`. After the assignment, `v` will take the value of `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `v` is initially equal to `n`.

After executing `v = i`, `v` is no longer equal to `n` but instead equals `i`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\); `v` is now equal to `i`.**
