To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop terminates. The loop continues as long as both `cnt` is not zero and `l` is less than `n + 1`.

From the provided information:
- After each iteration, `cnt` is decremented by 1.
- After each iteration, `l` is updated to `func_2() + 1`.

The loop will terminate when either `cnt` reaches 0 or `l` becomes equal to or greater than `n + 1`.

Let's analyze the final state:
- `cnt` will be 0 because the loop continues until `cnt` is decremented to 0.
- `l` will be the value it takes on the last iteration before the loop terminates, which means `l` could be `n + 1` if the loop stops because `l` reached `n + 1`, or it could be some value less than `n + 1` if the loop stops because `cnt` reached 0.

Since the exact value of `l` depends on the behavior of `func_2()`, we can only definitively say that `cnt` will be 0 at the end of the loop.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`cnt` is `0`, `l` is the value of `func_2() + 1` from the last iteration before the loop terminates.** 

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `cnt` will be 0, and `l` will be the value it was set to in the last iteration of the loop, which is `func_2() + 1`.
