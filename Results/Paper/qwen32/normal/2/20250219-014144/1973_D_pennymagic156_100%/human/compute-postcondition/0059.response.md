The code snippet simply calls the function `func_2()`. Since there is no assignment or direct modification to `cnt` or `l` within the provided code, their values remain unchanged. The function `func_2()` is called, but its effect on `cnt` and `l` is not specified in the given context, so we assume it does not alter these variables.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`cnt` is `0`, `l` is `n + 1`**.
