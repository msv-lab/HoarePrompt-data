The value of `l` is updated to be the result of `func_2()` plus 1. The values of `cnt` and `n` remain unchanged. Since `func_2()` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine its exact return value, but we know that `l` will be one more than whatever `func_2()` returns.

Output State: **`cnt` is any non-zero value, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and `n` must be greater than 0.**
