Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\); `i` is \(n - 1\); `v` is \(n - 1\) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, and `v` remain unchanged. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without altering the values of these variables.
