To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variables from `func_3()`**: 
   - `n` and `k` are returned by `func_3()`.
   - We know that `n >= k` and `n` is at least 0.
   - `k` must be at least 3.

2. **Other Variables**:
   - `i` is explicitly set to 1.
   - `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration.
   - `cnt` is set to `k - 2`.
   - `l` is the value returned by `func_2()` + 1, and `l` must be less than `n + 1`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the `print` statement:

```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

- `l` is the value returned by `func_2()` plus 1. Since the exact return value of `func_2()` is not specified, we denote it as `func_2_value`. Therefore, `l = func_2_value + 1`.
- `i` is explicitly set to 1.
- `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration, so `v = func_2_value`.
- `i * v` then becomes `1 * func_2_value = func_2_value`.

Putting this together, the `print` statement will output:

```plaintext
? {l} {i * v}
```

Where `l` is `func_2_value + 1` and `i * v` is `func_2_value`.

Therefore, the output can be described as:

Output: **? [func_2_value + 1] [func_2_value] (where func_2_value is the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration)**
