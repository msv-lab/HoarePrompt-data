To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the `while` loop condition:

```
while cnt and l < n + 1:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions are true:
1. `cnt` is truthy (non-zero).
2. `l` is less than `n + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `cnt` is at least 1 (originally greater than 1).
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
- `n` is greater than `l`.

Let's evaluate these conditions:

1. **Condition on `cnt`:**
   - Since `cnt` is at least 1, it is truthy. No adjustment is needed for `cnt`.

2. **Condition on `l` and `n`:**
   - We know `n` is greater than `l`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `l` must still be less than `n + 1`. Given that `n` is already greater than `l`, this condition is naturally satisfied.

Since both conditions are already satisfied with the given state, no adjustments are needed to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged:

State: **`cnt` is at least 1 (originally greater than 1), `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and `n` is greater than `l`.**
