Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `x` contains all integers connected to `x` from the input pairs; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001; `numCuts` is 0; `z` remains unchanged; `x` is 50001.**

Explanation: The value of `numCuts` was explicitly set to 0, but all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
