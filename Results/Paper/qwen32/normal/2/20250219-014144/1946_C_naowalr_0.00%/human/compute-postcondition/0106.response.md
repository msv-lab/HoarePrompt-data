The code assigns a specific integer value to the variable `R`. The value assigned is `100001` (which is `int(100000.0 + 1)`). No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `x` contains all integers connected to `x` from the input pairs; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001; `numCuts` and `z` remain unchanged.**
