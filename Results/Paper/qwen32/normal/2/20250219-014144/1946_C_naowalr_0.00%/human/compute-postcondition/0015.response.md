The code appends the value of `a` to the list at index `b` in the adjacency list `adj`. This means that the list at index `b` will now contain `b`, `a`, and `a` again (since `b` already contained `b` and `a`).

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` contains `b` twice, and the list at index `b` contains `b`, `a`, and `a`; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is an integer such that 0 < k < n; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input; `i` is 4.**
