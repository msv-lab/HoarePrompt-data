Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 1`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists, `z` remains unchanged, `x` is 2, `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `L` is 2 and `R` is 3. Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is 2.**
