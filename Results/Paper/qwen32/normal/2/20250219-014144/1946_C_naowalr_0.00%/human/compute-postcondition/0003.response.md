The code snippet provided initializes `adj` as a list of empty lists, with the length of the list being `n + 1`. This means that `adj` will have `n + 1` elements, each of which is an empty list. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, and `k` must be greater than 0 and less than `n`.**
