Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the vertices `b` that are directly connected to `a` by an edge; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is an integer such that 0 < k < n; `L` is 1.**

Explanation: The only change in the state is that the variable `L` is assigned the value `1`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
