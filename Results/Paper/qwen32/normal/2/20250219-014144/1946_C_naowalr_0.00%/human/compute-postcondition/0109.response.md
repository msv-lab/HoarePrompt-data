The value of `x` is calculated as the integer division of `(L + R) // 2`. Given that `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001, `x` will be `(1 + 100001) // 2`, which equals `50001`.

The values of `i`, `adj`, `L`, `R`, `numCuts`, and `z` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `x` contains all integers connected to `x` from the input pairs; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001; `numCuts` is 0; `z` remains unchanged; `x` is 50001.**
