The code calculates the midpoint of `L` and `R` and assigns it to `x`. Given the initial state, `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001. Therefore, `x` becomes `(1 + 100001) // 2`, which is `50001`.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each `adj[a]` contains all the nodes directly connected to node `a` as specified by the input pairs; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001; `numCuts` is 0; `z` is 1; `t` is some integer greater than 1; `i` is `n - 1`; `x` is 50001.**
