Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each `adj[a]` contains all the nodes directly connected to node `a` as specified by the input pairs; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `L` is 1; `R` is 2; `numCuts` is 0; `z` is 1; `t` is some integer greater than 1; `i` is `n - 1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `adj` will be a list of adjacency lists representing the connections between nodes as defined by the input pairs. The variables `n`, `k`, `L`, `R`, `numCuts`, `z`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial values, and the loop variable `i` will have reached its final value of `n - 1`.
