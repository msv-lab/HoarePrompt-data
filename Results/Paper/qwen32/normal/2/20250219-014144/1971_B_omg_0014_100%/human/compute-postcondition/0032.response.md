The code sorts the characters in the string `s` and assigns the sorted string to the variable `b`. The values of `t`, `s`, `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the newly input string provided by the user, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the new `s`, `i` is 4, `b` is the sorted version of `s`.**
