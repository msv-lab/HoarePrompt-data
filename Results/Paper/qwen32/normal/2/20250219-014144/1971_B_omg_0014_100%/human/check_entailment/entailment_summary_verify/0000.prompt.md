You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a string of lowercase English letters. For each string, it checks if all characters are identical. If they are, it outputs "NO". Otherwise, it outputs "YES" followed by the string sorted in ascending order if the original string is not already sorted, or in descending order if the original string is sorted in ascending order.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to rearrange the characters of a given string `s` to form a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`.
- If no such rearrangement is possible, we should output "NO".
- Otherwise, we should output "YES" followed by the rearranged string `r`.

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Handling Single Character Strings:**
   - If the length of the set of characters in `s` is 1 (`len(a) == 1`), it means all characters in `s` are the same. In this case, no rearrangement can result in a different string, so the program correctly outputs "NO".

2. **Handling Multiple Character Strings:**
   - For strings with more than one unique character, the program sorts the string in ascending order (`b = ''.join(sorted(s))`) and descending order (`c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))`).
   - It checks if the sorted string `b` is equal to the original string `s`. If it is, it prints the reversed sorted string `c`. Otherwise, it prints the sorted string `b`.
   - This ensures that the output string `r` is different from the original string `s` because sorting or reversing sorting will always produce a different string if there are multiple unique characters.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **Strings with Repeated Characters:** The program handles strings like "aaabbb" correctly by producing a rearranged string that is different from the original.
- **Strings with All Unique Characters:** The program handles strings like "abcdef" correctly by producing a rearranged string that is different from the original.
- **Strings with Mixed Repeated and Unique Characters:** The program handles strings like "aabbccdde" correctly by producing a rearranged string that is different from the original.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly handles all the specified cases and adheres to the problem description. There are no identified edge cases where the program fails to produce the correct output.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly identifies when it's impossible to rearrange the string to form a different string ("NO" for strings with all identical characters) and successfully rearranges other strings to form a different string ("YES" followed by the rearranged string).
