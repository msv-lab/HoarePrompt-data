The `print('YES')` statement in the given Python code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `a`, `i`) described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
- `s` is a string input by the user.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `a` is a set containing unique characters from the string `s`.
- `i` is the integer 4.

None of these variables are used in the `print` statement, so their specific values do not affect the output.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
