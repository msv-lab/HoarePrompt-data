You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht

Output

    YES

    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: The loop has processed all `n` test cases, printing "NO" if all characters in the string are the same, or "YES" followed by the sorted string in either ascending or descending order based on the original order of the string. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the loop variable `i` is equal to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a string of lowercase English letters. For each string, it checks if all characters are identical. If they are, it outputs "NO". Otherwise, it outputs "YES" followed by the string sorted in ascending order if the original string is not already sorted, or in descending order if the original string is sorted in ascending order.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input**:
   - The first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), which is the number of test cases.
   - Each of the next `t` lines contains a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.

2. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output "YES" followed by a rearranged string `r` that is different from `s`, if such a rearrangement is possible.
   - If no such rearrangement is possible, output "NO".

3. **Constraints**:
   - If the string consists of all identical characters, no rearrangement can result in a different string.
   - Otherwise, any rearrangement that changes the order of characters is acceptable.

### Program Analysis:
The program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases `n`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the string `s`.
   - It creates a set `a` from the characters of `s`. The length of this set indicates the number of unique characters in `s`.
   - If the length of `a` is 1, it means all characters in `s` are the same, so it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES" and attempts to create a different rearrangement of `s`:
     - It sorts the string `s` in ascending order to get `b`.
     - It sorts the string `s` in descending order to get `c`.
     - If `b` is equal to `s`, it prints `c` (which should be different from `s`).
     - Otherwise, it prints `b`.

### Evaluation:
- The logic correctly identifies when all characters in the string are the same (`len(a) == 1`) and outputs "NO".
- When there are multiple unique characters, the program generates two possible rearrangements (`b` and `c`). Since `b` and `c` are sorted versions of `s` in different orders, at least one of them must be different from `s` unless `s` is already sorted in both ascending and descending order simultaneously, which is not possible with more than one unique character.
- Therefore, the program ensures that a different rearrangement is printed when possible.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement. It handles all edge cases appropriately.
