Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the newly input string provided by the user, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the new `s`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If the length of `a` is 1, then `a` contains only one unique character. If the length of `a` is not equal to 1, `b` is the string `s` sorted in ascending order, and `c` is the string `s` sorted in descending order. If `b` is equal to the original `s`, then the original `s` is already sorted in ascending order; otherwise, the original `s` is not sorted in ascending order.**
