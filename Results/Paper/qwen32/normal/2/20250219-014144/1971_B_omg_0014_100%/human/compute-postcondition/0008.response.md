The code sorts the characters in the string `s` and assigns the sorted string to `b`. The values of `t`, `s`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the input string provided by the user, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`, and the length of `a` is not equal to 1; `b` is the string `s` with its characters sorted.**
