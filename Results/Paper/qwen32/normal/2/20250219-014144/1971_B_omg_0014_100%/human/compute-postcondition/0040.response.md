Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a string of lowercase English letters. For each string, it checks if all characters are identical. If they are, it outputs "NO". Otherwise, it outputs "YES" followed by the string sorted in ascending order if the original string is not already sorted, or in descending order if the original string is sorted in ascending order.**
