Output State: **`data` is a list containing the split input values, starting with the number of test cases `t` followed by pairs of `n` and `s` for each test case; `index` is 1; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`.**

Explanation: The value of `index` is incremented by 1, so it changes from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
