Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the number of coins and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of "U" and "D", where "U" indicates a coin facing up and "D" indicates a coin facing down. The function returns the count of contiguous segments in the string `s` where all coins are facing the same direction ("U" or "D").**
