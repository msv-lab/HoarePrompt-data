The given code snippet recalculates the value of `cn2` using the formula `n * (n - 1) // 2`. Since `cn2` is already defined in the initial state, executing this line will simply reassign `cn2` to the same value it would have been initially.

Given that the calculation does not change the value of `cn2` and no other variables are affected by this line of code, the output state remains the same as the initial state except for the explicit recalculation of `cn2`.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input over `m` iterations, `j` is 0, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, `i` is `m + 1`, `t` is unchanged.**
