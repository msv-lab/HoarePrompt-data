The provided code snippet reassigns the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` based on new inputs. All other variables (`sum_f`, `j`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, `gcd`, `i`, `t`) remain unchanged.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read during the `m` iterations, `j` is equal to `m`, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, `i` is `m + 1`, `t` is unchanged**.

Natural Language Explanation: The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the integers provided in the new input. All other variables retain their previous values.
