The code snippet `sum_f += f` increments the value of `sum_f` by `f`. Given the initial state, `sum_f` was already updated to be its previous value plus `f` twice. After executing the additional increment, `sum_f` will now be its previous value (which was already `previous_sum_f + 2*f`) plus `f` again, making it `previous_sum_f + 3*f`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input, `f` is an integer from input, `sum_f` is `previous_sum_f + 3*f`, `j` is `previous_j + 1`, `j` must be less than `m`**.
