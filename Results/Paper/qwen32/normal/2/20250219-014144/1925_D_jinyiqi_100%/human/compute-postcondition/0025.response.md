In the given for loop:

```python
for j in range(m):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will iterate over the variable `j` starting from 0 up to, but not including, `m`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be greater than 0.

Let's analyze the state before the loop starts and identify which states need to be adjusted:

- `n` is the first input integer.
- `m` is the second input integer.
- `k` is the third input integer.
- `sum_f` is 0.
- `j` is equal to `m`.
- `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
- `p` is calculated as `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`.
- `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`.
- `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.
- `i` is `m + 1`.
- `t` must be greater than `m + 1`.

Among these, the only variable in the loop head is `j`, and it is defined by the range `m`. Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment to ensure the loop can execute is `m`. Specifically, `m` must be greater than 0.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `sum_f`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, `gcd`, `i`, and `t`) do not affect the execution of the loop directly since they are not part of the loop head.

Thus, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is calculated as `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, `i` is `m + 1`, `t` must be greater than `m + 1`**
