### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step-by-step to verify its correctness.

#### Problem Understanding:
- We have `n` children and `m` pairs of friends with specific friendship values.
- The teacher conducts `k` random excursions, choosing a pair of children each time.
- If a chosen pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for future excursions.
- We need to calculate the expected sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen during the excursions, expressed as a fraction `p/q`, and output `p * q^-1 mod (10^9 + 7)`.

#### Key Points:
1. **Probability of Choosing a Pair**: 
   - There are `C(n, 2) = n*(n-1)/2` possible pairs of children.
   - The probability of choosing any specific pair in one excursion is `1 / C(n, 2)`.

2. **Expected Contribution of Each Friend Pair**:
   - Let's consider a friend pair `(a, b)` with initial friendship value `f`.
   - In each excursion, the probability of choosing this pair is `1 / C(n, 2)`.
   - Once chosen, the friendship value increases by 1 for future excursions.
   - The expected contribution of this pair to the total sum over `k` excursions is:
     - `f` for the first time it's chosen.
     - `f+1` for the second time, and so on.
   - This forms an arithmetic series with the first term `f` and common difference `1`.

3. **Sum of Arithmetic Series**:
   - The sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series with first term `f` and common difference `1` is:
     - `S = k*f + (k*(k-1))/2`
   - However, since the pair might not be chosen every time, we multiply by the probability of choosing the pair in each excursion:
     - `E = (k*f + (k*(k-1))/2) * (1 / C(n, 2))`

4. **Total Expected Sum**:
   - Summing up the expected contributions from all friend pairs:
     - `Total_E = Σ(E) = Σ((k*f + (k*(k-1))/2) * (1 / C(n, 2)))`
     - `Total_E = (1 / C(n, 2)) * (k*Σ(f) + m*(k*(k-1))/2)`
   - Here, `Σ(f)` is the sum of all initial friendship values, and `m` is the number of friend pairs.

5. **Fraction Representation**:
   - The total expected sum can be represented as a fraction `p/q`:
     - `p = k*Σ(f) + m*(k*(k-1))/2`
     - `q = C(n, 2) = n*(n-1)/2`
   - Simplifying, we get:
     - `p = 2*k*C(n, 2)*Σ(f) + m*k*(k-1)`
     - `q = 2*C(n, 2)^2`

6. **Modular Inverse**:
   - Since the output should be `p * q^-1 mod (10^9 + 7)`, we use the modular inverse of `q` modulo `10^9 + 7`.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program correctly calculates `cn2` as `n*(n-1)//2`.
- It sums up all initial friendship values (`sum_f`).
- It computes `p` and `q` as per the derived formulas.
- It simplifies `p` and `q` by dividing by their greatest common divisor (`gcd`).
- Finally, it prints `p * q^-1 mod (10^9 + 7)`.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
