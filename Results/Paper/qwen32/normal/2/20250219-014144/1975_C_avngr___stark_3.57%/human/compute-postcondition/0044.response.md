To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- If `min(a[i], a[i - 1]) > max`, then `max` is updated to `min(a[i], a[i - 1])`. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:** At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 again from its current value.
2. **Variable `n`:** This variable does not change within the loop; it remains constant throughout all iterations.

### Adjustment:
- Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 again.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. The value of `n` remains the same.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**. 

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can express the new state as:

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

However, to be more specific, if we denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be `i_prev + 1`.

For example, if `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be 3.

So, if we assume `i` was `i_prev` at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is `i_prev + 1`**.

Without the exact value of `i_prev`, the most accurate representation is:

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.
