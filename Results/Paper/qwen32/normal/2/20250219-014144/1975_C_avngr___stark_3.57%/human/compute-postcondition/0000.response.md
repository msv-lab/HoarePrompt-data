`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `t` is now a specific integer between 1 and 500. The other variables (`n` and `a`) remain unchanged as they have not been affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
