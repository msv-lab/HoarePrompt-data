Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ \(10^9\); `i` is 3. If `min(a[3], a[2])` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to the minimum value between `a[3]` and `a[2]`. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.**
