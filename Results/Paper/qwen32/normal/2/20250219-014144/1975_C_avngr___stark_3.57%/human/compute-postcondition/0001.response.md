In the given task, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500. The loop variable `_` (which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use) is used in the loop head, but it doesn't affect the execution condition of the loop. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

Given the state before the loop starts, the only variable in the loop head that we can adjust is `t`. Since `t` is already defined as an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes. The other variables `n` and `a` do not affect the execution of this specific for loop.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts already ensures that the loop will execute, assuming `t` is within the specified range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
