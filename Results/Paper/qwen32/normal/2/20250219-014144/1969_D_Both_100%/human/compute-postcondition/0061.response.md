The code snippet provided only updates the `max_profit` variable by setting it to the current value of `current_profit`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`heap` contains up to `k` elements including `item` with the smallest element removed and stored in `removed_item`. If `removed_item` is truthy, `current_profit` is adjusted by decreasing it by `removed_item[0]` and then further decreased by `item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, otherwise increased by `item[0]`. `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit`. `remaining_items` is an empty list. `n` is `new_n` (a positive integer). `k` is a positive integer (greater than 0). `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`. `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1. `combined` contains at least one element except the last one that was just popped. `item` is the last element that was just popped from `combined`.**
