To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the condition specified in the loop head. The loop will execute as long as `combined` is not empty.

Given the state right before the `while` loop:
- `heap` contains up to `k` elements from `combined` in the order they were popped.
- `remaining_items` is an empty list.
- `n` is `new_n` (a positive integer).
- `k` is a positive integer (greater than 0).
- `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`.
- `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`.
- `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`.
- `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.
- `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1.

The `while` loop condition is `while combined:`. This means the loop will execute if `combined` is not empty.

Since the only variable in the loop head is `combined`, we need to ensure that `combined` is not empty for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `combined` contains at least one element.

State: **`heap` contains up to `k` elements from `combined` in the order they were popped; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is `new_n` (a positive integer); `k` is a positive integer (greater than 0); `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged. `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1; `combined` must contain at least one element.**
