In the given for loop, the loop head is `for _ in range(k):`. This means that the only variable we can adjust directly related to the loop's execution is `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is greater than 0.

Let's analyze the provided state and determine what needs to be adjusted:

- `heap` is an empty list.
- `remaining_items` is an empty list.
- `n` is `new_n` (a positive integer).
- `k` is `new_k` (a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `new_k` <= `new_n`).
- `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`.
- `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`.
- `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`.
- `max_profit` is 0.
- `current_profit` is 0.
- `combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element (bonus) in ascending order.
- `test_cases` must be greater than or equal to 1.

From this, we can see that the only variable affecting the execution of the loop is `k`. To ensure the loop executes, `k` must be greater than 0.

State: **`heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is `new_n` (a positive integer), `k` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element (bonus) in ascending order, `test_cases` must be greater than or equal to 1**.
