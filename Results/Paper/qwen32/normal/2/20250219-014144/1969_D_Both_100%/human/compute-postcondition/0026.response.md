Postcondition: **`heap` contains up to `k` elements from `combined` in the order they were popped. If `combined` is not empty (it had fewer than `k` elements initially), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is `new_n` (a positive integer), `k` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, and `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` which is greater than `max_profit`. If `combined` is empty (it initially had `k` or more elements), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is `new_n` (a positive integer), `k` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, and `current_profit` remains 0 but is now greater than `max_profit`. `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1 in both scenarios.**
