The given Python code snippet creates a new list `neg_prices` by taking the negative of each element in the `prices` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is `new_n` (a positive integer), `k` is `new_k` (a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `new_k` <= `new_n`), `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of integers representing the bonuses for Bob, `max_profit` is an integer initialized to 0 representing the maximum profit found, `current_profit` is an integer initialized to 0 representing the current profit, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a negative price and a bonus, and the list is sorted by the bonus values, `test_cases` must be greater than or equal to 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The `neg_prices` list has been updated to contain the negative values of the elements from the `prices` list. All other variables retain their initial values.
