Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: heap is a list that will be used as a min-heap, remaining_items is a list that may store items not yet considered, n is a positive integer representing the number of items, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= n, prices is a list of integers representing the prices for Alice, neg_prices is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, bonuses is a list of integers representing the bonuses for Bob, max_profit is an integer initialized to 0 representing the maximum profit found, current_profit is an integer initialized to 0 representing the current profit, combined is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a negative price and a bonus, and the list is sorted by the bonus values, test_cases holds the return value of func_1().
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(test_cases):
    heap = []
    remaining_items = []
    n, k = func_2()
    prices = list(func_2())
    neg_prices = [(-price) for price in prices]
    bonuses = list(func_2())
    max_profit = 0
    current_profit = 0
    combined = list(zip(neg_prices, bonuses))
    combined.sort(key=lambda item: item[1])
    for _ in range(k):
        if combined:
            heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())
    if combined:
        current_profit = func_3(combined, heap)
    if current_profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = current_profit
    while combined:
        item = combined.pop()
        if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
            current_profit -= item[1]
        else:
            current_profit += item[0]
        removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
        if removed_item:
            current_profit -= removed_item[0]
        if current_profit > max_profit:
            max_profit = current_profit
    print(max_profit)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `combined` is an empty list; `heap` contains up to `k` elements; `current_profit` is the final adjusted profit; `max_profit` is the maximum profit encountered; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is `new_n`; `k` is a positive integer; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `combined` is empty, `heap` contains the last `k` items processed, `current_profit` reflects the final profit, `max_profit` holds the maximum profit encountered, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are unchanged, `prices` is unchanged, `neg_prices` is unchanged, `bonuses` is unchanged, `test_cases` is decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `combined` is an empty list; `heap` contains `min(k, len(combined_initial))` tuples from the original `combined` with all elements from `combined` having been processed; `current_profit` reflects the final profit after all adjustments; `max_profit` holds the maximum profit encountered during the loop execution; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of negated values from `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, and `test_cases` is greater than 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
