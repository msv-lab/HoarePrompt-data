The given code snippet simply reassigns an empty list to the variable `remaining_items`. This means that the previous contents of `remaining_items` (if any) are discarded, and `remaining_items` becomes an empty list.

Since no other variables are modified in the provided code snippet, their states remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `remaining_items` could contain items not yet considered, but after executing the code, `remaining_items` is explicitly set to an empty list.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of items, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= n, `prices` is a list of integers representing the prices for Alice, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, `bonuses` is a list of integers representing the bonuses for Bob, `max_profit` is an integer initialized to 0 representing the maximum profit found, `current_profit` is an integer initialized to 0 representing the current profit, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a negative price and a bonus, and the list is sorted by the bonus values, `test_cases` must be greater than or equal to 1.**
