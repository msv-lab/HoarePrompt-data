The code snippet creates a list of tuples called `combined` by zipping together the elements of `neg_prices` and `bonuses`. This means each tuple in `combined` will contain a pair of elements where the first element is from `neg_prices` and the second element is from `bonuses` at the same index.

Given the initial state, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, and `bonuses` is a list of integers. After executing the code, `combined` will be a list of tuples where each tuple consists of a negative price and its corresponding bonus.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is `new_n` (a positive integer), `k` is `new_k` (a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `new_k` <= `new_n`), `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a negative price and a bonus, and the list is not yet sorted, `test_cases` must be greater than or equal to 1.**
