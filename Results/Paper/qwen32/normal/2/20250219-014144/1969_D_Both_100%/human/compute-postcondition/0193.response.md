Output State: **`combined` is an empty list; `heap` contains up to `k` elements from the last iteration's `combined`; `current_profit` reflects the final profit after all adjustments in the last iteration; `max_profit` holds the maximum profit encountered across all iterations; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` for the last iteration; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()` for the last iteration; `neg_prices` is a list of negated values from `prices` for the last iteration; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()` for the last iteration, and `test_cases` is 0.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the `combined` list will be empty because all items would have been processed. The `heap` will contain up to `k` elements from the last iteration's `combined` list. The `current_profit` will reflect the final profit calculated in the last iteration, and `max_profit` will hold the highest profit encountered during any of the iterations. The `remaining_items` list will remain empty as it is not modified within the loop. The variables `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses` will retain their values from the last iteration, and `test_cases` will be 0 since all iterations have completed.
