Output State: **`heap` contains up to `k` elements including `item` with the smallest element removed and stored in `removed_item`. `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in the heap before `item` was pushed. If `removed_item` is truthy, `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting `removed_item[0]` from the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` based on the condition `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`. Specifically, if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` minus `item[1]` minus `removed_item[0]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` plus `item[0]` minus `removed_item[0]`. If `removed_item` is falsy, `current_profit` is calculated as in the original precondition without adjusting for `removed_item`. `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`; otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged. `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is `new_n` (a positive integer); `k` is a positive integer (greater than 0); `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`. `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1; `combined` contains at least one element except the last one that was popped. `item` is the last element that was popped from `combined`. `current_profit` is now `current_profit + item[0]`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`.**

In simple terms: The `current_profit` has been increased by the value of `item[0]`. All other conditions and variables remain the same unless `current_profit` exceeds `max_profit`, in which case `max_profit` is updated to the new `current_profit`.
