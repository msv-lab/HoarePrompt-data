Postcondition: **`heap` is updated with `item` pushed and the smallest element popped; `removed_item` holds the smallest element from the heap after the operation; `combined` has one less element, and `item` is the last element that was just removed from `combined`; if `removed_item` is not None, `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting `item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` or adding `item[0]` if `item[0] + item[1] < 0`, and then further adjusted by subtracting `removed_item[0]` if `removed_item` is not None; `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of negated values from `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, and `test_cases` is greater than 0. If `removed_item` is not None, `current_profit` is now `current_profit - removed_item[0]`.**
