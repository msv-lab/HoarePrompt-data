Postcondition: **`heap` contains up to `k` elements from `combined` in the order they were popped; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is `new_n` (a positive integer); `k` is a positive integer (greater than 0); `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged. `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1; `combined` contains one less element than it did initially; `item` is the last element that was in `combined`, and the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is less than 0.**
