To determine what will be printed by the `print(max_profit)` statement, let's analyze the initial state provided:

- `combined` is an empty list.
- `heap` contains the last `k` items processed.
- `current_profit` reflects the final profit.
- `max_profit` holds the maximum profit encountered.
- `remaining_items` is an empty list.
- `n` and `k` are unchanged.
- `prices` is unchanged.
- `neg_prices` is unchanged.
- `bonuses` is unchanged.
- `test_cases` is decremented by 1.

The key variable here is `max_profit`, which holds the maximum profit encountered during the execution of the program. Since no specific value is provided for `max_profit` in the initial state, we can only describe it in terms of its role in the program.

Given this information, the `print(max_profit)` statement will output the value of `max_profit`, which is the highest profit encountered during the processing of the items.

Output: **max_profit (where max_profit is the maximum profit encountered during the processing of the items)**
