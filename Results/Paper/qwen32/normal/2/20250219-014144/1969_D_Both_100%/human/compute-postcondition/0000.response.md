To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_1()` does. However, since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the given context, we can only infer that it returns something and assigns it to `test_cases`. Without knowing the specifics of `func_1()`, we cannot determine the exact value or type of `test_cases`.

Given this limitation, we can only assume that `test_cases` will hold whatever `func_1()` returns, and no other variables will be affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State will be:

Output State: **heap is a list that will be used as a min-heap, remaining_items is a list that may store items not yet considered, n is a positive integer representing the number of items, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= n, prices is a list of integers representing the prices for Alice, neg_prices is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, bonuses is a list of integers representing the bonuses for Bob, max_profit is an integer initialized to 0 representing the maximum profit found, current_profit is an integer initialized to 0 representing the current profit, combined is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a negative price and a bonus, and the list is sorted by the bonus values, test_cases holds the return value of func_1().**
