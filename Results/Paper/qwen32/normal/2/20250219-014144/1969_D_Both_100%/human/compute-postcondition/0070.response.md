The given Python code snippet creates a new list called `neg_prices` by taking each element from the `prices` list, negating it, and storing it in the new list.

Given the initial state, `prices` is a list returned by `func_2()`. The code transforms each price in `prices` to its negative counterpart and stores these negative values in `neg_prices`.

Here's the updated state of the variables after executing the code:

- `combined` remains an empty list.
- `heap` remains an empty list.
- `current_profit` retains its value as the final adjusted profit.
- `max_profit` retains its value as the maximum profit encountered.
- `remaining_items` remains an empty list.
- `n` retains its value as the first value returned by `func_2()`.
- `k` retains its value as the second value returned by `func_2()`.
- `prices` retains its original list of values returned by `func_2()`.
- `neg_prices` is now a list containing the negative values of the elements in `prices`.
- `bonuses` retains its list of values returned by `func_2()`.
- `test_cases` is decremented by 1.

Output State: **`combined` is an empty list; `heap` is an empty list; `current_profit` is the final adjusted profit; `max_profit` is the maximum profit encountered; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`.**
