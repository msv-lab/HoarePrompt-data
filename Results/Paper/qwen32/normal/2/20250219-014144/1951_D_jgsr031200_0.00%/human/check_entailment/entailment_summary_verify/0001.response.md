### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and compare it against the problem requirements and the function summary.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
- Bob needs to set up at most 60 stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
- Alice buys greedily from the first stall to the last.
- The prices must be integers between 1 and \(10^{18}\).

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by defining a function `func_1(n, k)` that checks if it's possible for Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels with `n` coins. However, the logic used in the code is flawed and doesn't ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

Here are the specific issues with the provided code:
1. **Incomplete Logic**:
   - The code initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]` and then tries to use these costs to determine if Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - The loop iterates over these costs, but it doesn't handle the general case where more than two stalls might be needed.
   - The condition `if h < k` checks if the total number of jewels bought is less than `k`, but it doesn't ensure that the exact number of jewels bought is `k`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the edge case where `n == k` by setting up a single stall with a price of `1`.
   - It also correctly identifies when `n < k` as impossible.

3. **Insufficient Price Setup**:
   - The code only considers two prices (`n - k + 1` and `1`), which is insufficient to guarantee the solution for all cases.
   - A more robust approach would involve setting up stalls with decreasing prices, such as powers of 2, to cover a wide range of values efficiently.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
The function summary states that `func_1` prints 'YES' and additional information if `n` can be reduced to 0 by subtracting multiples of `n - k + 1` and `1`, such that the total number of subtractions is at least `k`. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This summary does not reflect the actual problem requirements, which require setting up stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

#### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve setting up stalls with prices that allow Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels. Using powers of 2 as prices is a good strategy because it allows covering a wide range of values efficiently.

Here's a corrected version of the code:
```python
def func_1(n, k):
    if n == k:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(1)
        return
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
        return
    
    # Try to use powers of 2 as prices
    prices = []
    remaining_k = k
    remaining_n = n
    power = 0
    
    while remaining_k > 0 and power < 60:
        price = 2 ** power
        if price > remaining_n:
            break
        count = min(remaining_k, remaining_n // price)
        if count > 0:
            prices.append(price)
            remaining_k -= count
            remaining_n -= count * price
        power += 1
    
    if remaining_k == 0:
        print('YES')
        print(len(prices))
        print(*prices)
    else:
        print('NO')

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_1(n, k)
```

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all cases due to insufficient logic for setting up the stall prices. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Final: **False**
