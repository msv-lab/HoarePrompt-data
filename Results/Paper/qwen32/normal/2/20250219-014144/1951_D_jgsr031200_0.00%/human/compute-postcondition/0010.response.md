The code snippet creates a list named `costs` with two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`. This operation does not affect the values of `n` and `k`; it only introduces a new list variable `costs`.

Given that `n` and `k` are positive integers with the conditions `1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}`, `n ≠ k`, and `n ≥ k`, the value of `n - k + 1` will be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 (since `n` is not less than `k`).

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k; `costs` is a list containing `[n - k + 1, 1]`.**
