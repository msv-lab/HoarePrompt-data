In this task, we are given the initial state where `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\), and it is specified that currently, `n` is equal to `k`. However, the `print` statement in the provided Python code snippet does not reference these variables `n` and `k` at all. Instead, it simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Let's break down the given information and the code:

- **Initial State**: 
  - `n` and `k` are positive integers within the range \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
  - It is explicitly stated that `n` is equal to `k`.

- **Code Snippet**:
  ```python
  print('YES')
  ```

Since the `print` statement is hardcoded to output the string `'YES'`, the values of `n` and `k` do not influence the output of this particular print statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **YES**
