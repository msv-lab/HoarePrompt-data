### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided code and suggests a more robust approach using powers of 2 as prices. Let's systematically evaluate the given program using the annotated version to confirm the accuracy of the original assessment.

#### Problem Recap:
- Alice has `n` coins and wants to buy exactly `k` jewels.
- Bob can set up at most 60 stalls with prices between 1 and \(10^{18}\).
- Alice buys greedily, starting from the first stall and moving to the next.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Function Definition and Calls**:
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` is called but not defined within the provided code snippet. This would result in a `NameError` at runtime.
   
2. **Handling Specific Cases**:
   - When `n == k`, the code correctly prints "YES", sets up one stall with a price of 1, and returns.
   - When `n < k`, the code correctly prints "NO" and returns.

3. **General Case Logic**:
   - The code initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]` and iterates over these costs.
   - For each cost `i` in `costs`, it calculates how many jewels Alice can buy (`curr = n // i`), adds this to `h`, and subtracts the total cost from `n`.
   - After the loop, if `h < k`, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" along with the costs.

4. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations show that the state after the loop is inconsistent. Specifically, `n` becomes 0, and `h` is calculated incorrectly.
   - The annotations also indicate that the logic for determining `h` is flawed, as it does not correctly account for the number of jewels bought.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The provided code does not handle the general case correctly. It only considers two fixed prices (`n - k + 1` and `1`), which is insufficient to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels for arbitrary `n` and `k`.
- The logic for calculating `h` and adjusting `n` is flawed, leading to incorrect results.
- The use of powers of 2 as suggested in the original assessment is a more effective strategy because it allows for a flexible and efficient setup of stall prices.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment accurately identifies the issues with the provided code and suggests a correct approach. The given program is indeed incorrect for the general case.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
