### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Problem Analysis:
Bob needs to set up at most 60 stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using at most `n` coins. Alice buys greedily, meaning she will buy as many jewels as possible from the first stall, then move to the next, and so on.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Initial Checks**:
   - If `n == k`, the simplest solution is to have one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel. Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - If `n < k`, it's impossible for Alice to buy `k` jewels because she doesn't have enough coins.

2. **Costs Calculation**:
   - The code initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - It then iterates over these costs, calculating how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall (`curr = n // i`) and updating the total number of jewels bought (`h`) and the remaining coins (`n -= i * curr`).
   - If the total number of jewels bought (`h`) is less than `k`, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES' along with the number of stalls and their respective costs.

#### Issues in the Code:
- The logic for determining the costs and the number of stalls is flawed. The code only considers two stalls with fixed costs `[n - k + 1, 1]`, which is not sufficient to guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels in all cases.
- The code does not ensure that the number of stalls does not exceed 60.
- The code does not handle the general case of distributing the coins across up to 60 stalls to achieve exactly `k` jewels.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to find a way to distribute the coins across up to 60 stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One approach is to use powers of 2 for the prices, as it allows us to cover a wide range of values efficiently.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    
    if n == k:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(1)
        continue
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
        continue
    
    # Try to use powers of 2 for the prices
    stalls = []
    remaining_k = k
    power = 0
    
    while remaining_k > 0 and power < 60:
        if (1 << power) <= remaining_k:
            stalls.append((1 << power))
            remaining_k -= (1 << power)
        power += 1
    
    if remaining_k > 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(len(stalls))
        print(*stalls)
```

This corrected version uses powers of 2 for the prices and ensures that the number of stalls does not exceed 60.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the original code, the provided program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
