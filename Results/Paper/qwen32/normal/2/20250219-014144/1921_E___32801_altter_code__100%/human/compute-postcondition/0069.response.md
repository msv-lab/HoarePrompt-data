The code snippet sets `y1` to 1. This change affects the value of `t` since `t` is initially defined as `abs(y2 - y1)`. With the new value of `y1`, `t` will now be `abs(y2 - 1)`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is `abs(y2 - 1)`, `r` is a list containing six integers `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]`, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2] + a`, `y1` is equal to `1`, `x2` is equal to `r[4] - a`, `y2` is equal to `r[5]`, `a` is equal to `y1 - 1`, `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`. Additionally, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is at least 1, `x2` is less than or equal to `n`, and `y1` is less than or equal to `y2`.**

In simpler terms, `y1` is now 1, which changes the calculation of `t` to `abs(y2 - 1)`. All other variables retain their previous definitions and constraints.
