Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `t` is either `abs(y2 - y1)` or `abs(m - y1)`
   - `r` is a list containing six integers `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]`
   - `n` is equal to `r[0]` (height of the rectangle)
   - `m` is equal to `r[1]` (width of the rectangle)
   - `x1` is `(x_a + 1) + a`
   - `x2` is `r[4] - a`
   - `y1` remains unchanged
   - `a` is `0`
   - `b` is `x2 - x1`
   - `x2` is greater than `x1`
   - `x1` is at least 1
   - `x2` is less than or equal to `n`
   - `y2` is either `1` or `m`
   - `c` is either `y1 - 1` or `1` or `-1` depending on the condition `y2 <= y1`

2. **Conditions:**
   - Either `b // 2 <= a` or `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c` or `y1 < 1` or `y1 > m` or `x1 < 1` or `x1 > n`

### Analysis

- Since `a` is `0`, the condition `b // 2 <= a` simplifies to `b // 2 <= 0`. Given that `b` is `x2 - x1` and `x2 > x1`, `b` is positive, so `b // 2 <= 0` is false.
- The other conditions involve `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, and `c`. However, these conditions do not affect the execution of the `print('draw')` statement directly because they are not used within the print statement itself.

### Print Statement

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('draw')
```

This statement will always print the string `'draw'` regardless of the values of the variables described in the initial state.

### Final Output

Output: **draw**
