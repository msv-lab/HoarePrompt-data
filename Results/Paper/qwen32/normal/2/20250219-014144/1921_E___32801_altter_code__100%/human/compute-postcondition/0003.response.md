Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `r` is a list containing six integers: \([h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]\).
  - \(1 \leq x_a, x_b \leq h \leq 10^6\)
  - \(1 \leq y_a, y_b \leq w \leq 10^9\)
- `n` is assigned the value of `r[0]` (which is `h`).
- `m` is assigned the value of `r[1]` (which is `w`).
- `x1` is assigned the value of `r[2]` (which is `x_a`).
- `y1` is assigned the value of `r[3]` (which is `y_a`).
- `x2` is assigned the value of `r[4]` (which is `x_b`).
- `y2` is assigned the value of `r[5]` (which is `y_b`).
- It is also mentioned that `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('draw')
```

### Analysis:
The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'draw'`. This string does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, or `y2`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'draw'` regardless of the values of the variables defined in the initial state.

### Final Output:
Output: **draw**
