Postcondition: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `r` is a list containing six integers `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]`, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is `(x_a + 1) + a`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y1` is incremented or decremented based on the comparison with `y2`, `a` is `m - y2` since `y1 < y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1`. Additionally, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is at least 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`. `y2` is greater than `y1`.**
