Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's analyze what will be printed:

- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000.
- `r` is a list containing six integers `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]`.
- `n` is assigned the value of `r[0]` (which is `h`).
- `m` is assigned the value of `r[1]` (which is `w`).
- `x1` is assigned the value of `r[2]` (which is `x_a`).
- `y1` is assigned the value of `r[3]` (which is `y_a`).
- `x2` is assigned the value of `r[4]` (which is `x_b`).
- `y2` is assigned the value of `r[5]` (which is `y_b`).
- It is also specified that `x2` is greater than `x1` and `(x2 - x1)` is even.
- Additionally, `y1` is equal to `y2`.

However, the `print` statement in the code is:
```python
print('bob')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, or `y2`. It simply prints the string `'bob'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **bob**
