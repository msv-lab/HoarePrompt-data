Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1. If `f` was originally 0, then: if `a[i]` was less than `b[i]`, `a[i]` and `b[i]` are swapped and `f` is set to 1; if `a[i]` was greater than `b[i]`, `f` is set to 1; if `a[i]` was equal to `b[i]`, `f` remains 0. If `f` was not 0, and `a[i]` was greater than `b[i]`, `a[i]` and `b[i]` are swapped.**
