Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; For each test case, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9. Additionally, `x` and `y` have the same length for each test case; `a` is a list of digits from the input string `s`; `b` is a list of characters from the new input string; `f` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if f == 0:
        if a[i] < b[i]:
            a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
            f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            f = 1
    elif a[i] > b[i]:
        a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, both consist only of digits from 1 to 9, and both have the same length, `a` is a list of digits from the input string `s` that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list of characters from the new input string, and `f` is either 0 or 1. If the `i`-th element of `a` is greater than the `i`-th element of `b`, then `f` is set to 1. Otherwise, `f` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, both consist only of digits from 1 to 9, and both have the same length. `a` is a list of digits from the input string `s` and `b` is a list of characters from the new input string. If `f` was initially 0 and `a[i] < b[i]`, then `a[i]` and `b[i]` are swapped, `f` is set to 1, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `f` was initially 0 and `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, `f` is set to 1. If `f` was initially 1, and `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, the `i`-th elements of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `f` is set to 1. Otherwise, `f` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is incremented by 1. If `f` was originally 0, then: if `a[i]` was less than `b[i]`, `a[i]` and `b[i]` are swapped and `f` is set to 1; if `a[i]` was greater than `b[i]`, `f` is set to 1; if `a[i]` was equal to `b[i]`, `f` remains 0. If `f` was not 0, and `a[i]` was greater than `b[i]`, `a[i]` and `b[i]` are swapped.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
