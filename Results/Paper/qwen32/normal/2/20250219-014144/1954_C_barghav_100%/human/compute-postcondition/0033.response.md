The given code snippet swaps the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. Given the initial state that `i` is incremented by 1, we assume `i` already holds some integer value before this operation.

After executing the code, the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` are swapped. No other variables are mentioned as being affected, so their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `a[i]` is the original value of `b[i]`; `b[i]` is the original value of `a[i]`.**
