Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. For each test case, it receives two positive integers `n` and `k`, both between 1 and 10^18 inclusive. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
