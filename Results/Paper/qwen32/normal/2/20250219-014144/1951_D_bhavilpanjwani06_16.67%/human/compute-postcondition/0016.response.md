Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the remaining t-1 test cases, there are two positive integers n and k such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18} and n is greater than or equal to k. If n is equal to k, then no specific change is made to n or k for the current test case. Otherwise, for the current test case, either `k - 1 < n - k + 1` or `k - 1` is not less than `n - k + 1`.**
