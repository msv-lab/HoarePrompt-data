### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by handling three distinct cases for each test case:

1. **Case 1:** If \( n < k \):
   - Since Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels she wants to buy, it is impossible for her to buy \( k \) jewels.
   - The program correctly outputs "NO".

2. **Case 2:** If \( n = k \):
   - Alice can buy exactly \( k \) jewels if she buys one jewel from a single stall priced at \( n \) coins.
   - The program correctly outputs "YES", followed by 1 and \( n \).

3. **Case 3:** If \( n > k \):
   - Here, the program checks if \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \).
     - If true, it sets up two stalls: one with price \( n - k + 1 \) and another with price 1.
     - This setup ensures Alice buys \( k - 1 \) jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall, totaling \( k \) jewels.
     - If false, it outputs "NO", implying that setting up two stalls cannot satisfy the condition.

However, the logic for Case 3 is incomplete and incorrect. Specifically, the condition \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \) does not cover all scenarios where Alice can buy exactly \( k \) jewels with at most 60 stalls. The provided solution fails to consider more complex setups involving multiple stalls with varying prices that could sum up to exactly \( k \) jewels.

To ensure correctness, the program should be able to handle scenarios where the number of stalls and their prices need to be strategically chosen to meet the requirement of buying exactly \( k \) jewels without exceeding the available coins \( n \). The current implementation only considers very limited configurations and thus may incorrectly output "NO" in cases where a valid setup is possible.

### Correctness:
**False**
