Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nodes` is a `defaultdict` where each key is a node and the value is a list of adjacent nodes; `start` is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= start <= n, `n` is the number of nodes in the tree, `t` is the second integer read from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `leaves` is an empty `deque`.
Code of the loop:
for key in nodes:
    if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
        leaves.append(key)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `nodes` is a `defaultdict` with at least one key-value pair, `start` is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= start <= n, `n` is the number of nodes in the tree, `t` is the second integer read from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True. If the length of the list associated with the key `key` in `nodes` is exactly 1, then `leaves` is a `deque` containing the value of `key`. Otherwise, `leaves` remains an empty `deque`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `nodes` is a `defaultdict` with at least one key-value pair, `start` is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= start <= n, `n` is the number of nodes in the tree, `t` is the second integer read from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True. If the length of the list associated with the key `key` in `nodes` is exactly 1, then `leaves` is a `deque` containing the value of `key`. Otherwise, `leaves` remains an empty `deque`. `key` is the next key in `nodes`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `nodes` is a `defaultdict` with at least two key-value pairs, `start` is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= start <= n, `n` is the number of nodes in the tree, `t` is the second integer read from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True. If the length of the list associated with the key `key` in `nodes` is exactly 1, then `leaves` is a `deque` containing the value of `key` and also contains the newly appended `key`. Otherwise, `leaves` is a `deque` containing only the newly appended `key`. `key` is the next key in `nodes` that has not been processed yet.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
