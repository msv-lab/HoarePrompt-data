The code snippet `nodes[u].append(v)` appends the integer `v` to the list of integers associated with the key `u` in the `defaultdict` named `nodes`. This means that the list stored under the key `u` will now include `v` as one of its elements.

The values of `start`, `t`, `edges`, `empty`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged. However, the structure of `nodes` is modified by adding `v` to the list of values for the key `u`.

Output State: **`nodes` is a `defaultdict` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, with `v` appended to the list of integers for key `u`; `start` is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= start <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree, `n` must be at least 2, `t` is the second integer read from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `u` and `v` are integers read from the input.**
