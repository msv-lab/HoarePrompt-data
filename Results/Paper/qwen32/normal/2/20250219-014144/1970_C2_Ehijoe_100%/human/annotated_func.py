#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` determines whether there is a cycle in a graph represented by the `nodes` dictionary starting from the `start` node, excluding the path coming from the `parent` node. It returns `False` if the current node has no other neighbors except the parent, indicating a dead end or leaf node. Otherwise, it recursively checks its neighbors and returns `True` if any of them form a cycle.

If `moves` is truthy, the program follows the path indicated by `moves`. Otherwise, `moves` is False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input to construct a tree represented by a dictionary of nodes and their neighbors. It identifies leaf nodes and then determines a starting node from user input. Based on the result of an internal function `func_1`, which presumably analyzes the tree starting from the given node, it prints either "Ron" or "Hermione".
