Output State: **`nodes` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing neighboring nodes, `start` is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= start <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `t` is the second integer read from the input, `edges` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The only change made by the code is the initialization of the `edges` list, which is set to an empty list. All other variables retain their initial values.
