Postcondition: **`nodes` is a `defaultdict` where each key is a node and the value is a list of adjacent nodes; `start` is the integer read from the input such that 1 <= start <= n; `n` is the number of nodes in the tree; `t` is the second integer read from the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `leaves` is a `deque` containing all keys from `nodes` that have a list of length exactly 1; `moves` is the return value of `func_1(nodes, start)`. If `moves` is truthy, the program follows the path indicated by `moves`. Otherwise, `moves` is False.**
