The given code snippet appends the value of `p` to the list `ans`. Since the initial state specifies that `ans` is an empty list, after appending `p`, `ans` will contain one element, which is `p`. No other variables are modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing all elements of `a` in the order specified by `s` (and thus `b` is non-empty), `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`, `ans` is a list containing `p`, `p` is `p * v`.**
