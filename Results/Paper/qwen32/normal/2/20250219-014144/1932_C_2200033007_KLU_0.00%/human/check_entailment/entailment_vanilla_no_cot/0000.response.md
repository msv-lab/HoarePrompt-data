Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not compute the product of all elements of the array `a` at each step and then take the remainder when divided by `m`. Instead, it incorrectly constructs a new list `b` by appending elements based on the commands, and then computes the product of this new list in reverse order.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Product Calculation**: The program does not calculate the product of all elements of the array `a` at each step. Instead, it builds a new list `b` by appending elements based on the commands ('L' or 'R') and then calculates the product of this new list `b` in reverse order. This does not match the requirement of calculating the product of the current state of the array `a` at each step.

2. **Modulo Operation**: The program should take the modulo `m` at each step of the product calculation, but it only takes the modulo once after computing the product of the entire list `b`.

To fix the program, you need to maintain the product of the current state of the array `a` and update it according to the commands ('L' or 'R'). Here's a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    product = 1
    for num in a:
        product = (product * num) % m
    
    result = []
    left_index = 0
    right_index = n - 1
    
    for command in s:
        result.append(product)
        if command == 'L':
            product = (product * pow(a[left_index], m - 2, m)) % m
            left_index += 1
        else:
            product = (product * pow(a[right_index], m - 2, m)) % m
            right_index -= 1
    
    return result
```

In this corrected version:
- We initialize `product` with the product of all elements in `a`, taking the modulo `m` at each step.
- For each command, we append the current `product` to the result list.
- We then update the `product` by removing the element that is about to be removed from the array. This is done using modular multiplicative inverse (`pow(a[index], m - 2, m)`), which effectively divides the product by `a[index]` under modulo `m`.

This ensures that the product of the current state of the array `a` is correctly computed and the modulo operation is applied at each step.
