Output State: **The program returns the list `ans` in its original order, which contains the cumulative products of elements in `b` from the last element to the first.**

Explanation: The function `reversed(ans)` reverses the list `ans`. Since `ans` already contains the cumulative products of elements in `b` in reverse order, reversing `ans` will return it to its original order.
