#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4. s is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the list `ans` in its original order, which contains the cumulative products of elements in `b` from the last element to the first.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (the length of list `a` and string `s`), `m` (an integer, though not used in the function), `a` (a list of `n` integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'). It constructs a new list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the direction specified by `s`. Then, it calculates the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order and returns this list.
