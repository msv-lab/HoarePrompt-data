Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'
- `b` is a list containing all elements of `a` in the order specified by `s` (and thus `b` is non-empty)
- `l` is `n`
- `r` is `-1`
- `ans` is a list containing `p`
- `p` is `p * v`
- `v` is the next element in the reversed list `b`

Code Snippet:
```python
p = p * v
```

This line of code multiplies the current value of `p` by `v` and assigns the result back to `p`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing all elements of `a` in the order specified by `s` (and thus `b` is non-empty), `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`, `ans` is a list containing `p`, `p` is `p * v * v`, `v` is the next element in the reversed list `b`.**

Explanation:
- All variables except `p` remain unchanged.
- `p` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `v` again, so if `p` was initially `p * v`, it now becomes `p * v * v`.
- `v` remains the same as it was before the operation.
