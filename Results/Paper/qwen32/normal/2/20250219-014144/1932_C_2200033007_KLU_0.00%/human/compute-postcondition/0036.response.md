To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over the list `b` in reverse order. For each element `v` in `b`:
- It multiplies the current value of `p` by `v`.
- It appends the new value of `p` to the list `ans`.

### Initial State Recap
- `t`: An integer between 1 and 10^4 (not modified by the loop).
- `n`: An integer between 1 and 2·10^5 (length of `a` and `s`).
- `m`: An integer between 1 and 10^4 (not modified by the loop).
- `a`: A list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^4.
- `s`: A string of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'.
- `b`: A list derived from `a` based on the order specified by `s`.
- `l`: Set to `n` (not modified by the loop).
- `r`: Set to `-1` (not modified by the loop).
- `ans`: An initially empty list.
- `p`: Initialized to 1.

### Final Output State
After the loop completes all iterations:
- `p` will be the product of all elements in `b` (which is equivalent to the product of all elements in `a` in the order specified by `s`).
- `ans` will contain the cumulative products of the elements in `b` as the loop progresses.

Let's denote the elements of `b` as `b[0], b[1], ..., b[n-1]`. The loop processes these elements in reverse order, so the first element processed is `b[n-1]`, then `b[n-2]`, and so on until `b[0]`.

The final state of `ans` will be:
- `ans[0]` will be `b[n-1]`
- `ans[1]` will be `b[n-1] * b[n-2]`
- `ans[2]` will be `b[n-1] * b[n-2] * b[n-3]`
- ...
- `ans[n-1]` will be `b[n-1] * b[n-2] * ... * b[0]` (which is the product of all elements in `b`)

Thus, `ans` will be a list of cumulative products starting from the last element of `b` to the product of all elements in `b`.

### Final Output State in Specified Format
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing all elements of `a` in the order specified by `s`, `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`, `ans` is a list containing the cumulative products of elements in `b` in reverse order, `p` is the product of all elements in `b`.**

In simpler terms, `ans` will contain the cumulative products of the elements of `b` from the last to the first, and `p` will be the product of all elements in `b`.
