The given code snippet appends the element at index `l` of list `a` to list `b`. However, the variable `l` is not defined in the initial state provided. Assuming `l` is intended to be `i` (as `i` is the only index-like variable mentioned), the element at index `i` of list `a` would be appended to list `b`.

Given that `i` is `n`, and considering that Python uses 0-based indexing, attempting to access `a[n]` would result in an `IndexError` because `n` is out of bounds for the list `a` (which has indices from 0 to `n-1`). However, since the task specifies to simulate the execution without describing the error, we'll proceed with the assumption that `l` was meant to be a valid index.

If we assume `l` was intended to be `i-1` (the last valid index of `a`), then the element at index `i-1` of list `a` would be appended to list `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R', `i` is `n`, `b` contains the element `a[n-1]` appended to it.**

In simpler terms, the list `b` now includes the last element of list `a`. All other variables retain their original values.
