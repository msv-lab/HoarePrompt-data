The code appends the current value of `sm` to the list `cts`. Since `sm` was already included in `cts` before the code snippet, appending `sm` again means `cts` now contains `sm` twice. The values of `i`, `j`, `sm`, and the length of `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `sm` is `sm + a[3]`, `len(a)` is greater than 3, `cts` includes the value of `sm` appended to it twice.**
