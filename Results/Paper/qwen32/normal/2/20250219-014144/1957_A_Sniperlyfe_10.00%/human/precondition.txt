arr is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases, followed by pairs of lines for each test case. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.
