#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the list contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the stick lengths.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `freq` is a dictionary containing the counts of each unique stick length found in `arr` (excluding the first element which is the number of test cases).
    return sum(v // 4 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer divisions of each value in the dictionary `freq` by 4.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list `arr` as input, where the first element indicates the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing stick lengths. The function calculates and returns the total number of complete sets of four sticks that can be formed from each unique stick length across all test cases.
