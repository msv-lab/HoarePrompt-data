The value of `pref` is updated by adding the value of `lista_A[i]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least `k + 1`, `k` is the second input integer, `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers obtained from the input, `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers obtained from the input, `soma_b` is 0, `pref` is `pref + lista_A[i]`, and `lista_A[i]` is less than `lista_B[i]`.**
