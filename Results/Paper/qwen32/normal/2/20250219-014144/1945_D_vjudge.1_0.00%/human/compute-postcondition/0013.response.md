The code snippet `soma_b += lista_B[i]` increments the value of `soma_b` by the value of `lista_B[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least `k + 1`, `k` is the second input integer, `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers obtained from the input, `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers obtained from the input, `soma_b` is `soma_b + lista_B[i]`, `pref` is 0, and `lista_A[i]` is greater than or equal to `lista_B[i]`.**
