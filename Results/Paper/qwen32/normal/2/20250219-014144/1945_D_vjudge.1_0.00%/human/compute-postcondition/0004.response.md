The given code snippet reverses `lista_B`. Initially, `lista_B` is a new list of integers obtained from the input. After executing the `reverse()` method, the order of elements in `lista_B` is reversed.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers obtained from the input, `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers obtained from the input.**

In natural language: The output state remains the same except that `lista_B` is now reversed compared to its original order. The values of `n`, `k`, and `lista_A` remain unchanged.
