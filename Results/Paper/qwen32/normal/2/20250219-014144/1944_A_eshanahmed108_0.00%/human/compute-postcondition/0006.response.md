Let's analyze the given task step by step.

The for loop in question is:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the loop head, we can see that the loop variable is `_` (which is a common convention for a throwaway variable when the loop variable is not used inside the loop), and the range is determined by `int(input())`. This means that the number of iterations is based on the integer value provided as input.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is decreased by 1
- `n` and `k` are integer values from the input

Since the loop variable `_` does not affect the state outside the loop, we don't need to adjust it. The loop continues based on the range provided by `int(input())`.

However, since `t` is mentioned as being decreased by 1, it suggests that `t` might be related to the number of iterations left. But since `t` is not part of the loop head, we cannot directly adjust `t` in the loop head. The loop head only considers the range determined by `int(input())`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the range provided by `int(input())` should still be greater than the current iteration count. Since we don't have direct control over the input, we can infer that the loop will continue as long as the initial input value (let's call it `x`) is greater than the current iteration count.

Given that `t` is decreased by 1 at the end of each iteration, we can infer that `t` might be initialized to the same value as the input `x`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` should be greater than 0.

However, since we can only adjust the state of objects in the loop head, we need to focus on the range provided by `int(input())`. Assuming `x` is the initial input value, and the loop has iterated `y` times, the loop will continue as long as `x - y > 0`.

Since we don't have direct control over `x` or `y`, we can only describe the state in terms of the loop head. The loop will continue as long as the range provided by `int(input())` is greater than the current iteration count.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is decreased by 1, `n` and `k` are the integer values from the input, and the range provided by `int(input())` should still allow for one more iteration.**

However, strictly adhering to the requirement of only adjusting the state of objects in the loop head, we can say:
State: **`n` and `k` are the integer values from the input.**

Since `t` is not part of the loop head, we do not adjust it in the state description for the loop head.

Final Answer:
State: **`n` and `k` are the integer values from the input.**
