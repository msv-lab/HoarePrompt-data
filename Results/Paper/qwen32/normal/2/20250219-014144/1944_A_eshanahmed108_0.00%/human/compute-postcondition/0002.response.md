Let's analyze the given Python code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This variable represents the number of test cases but does not affect the current print statement directly.
- `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input split into two parts.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement uses a conditional expression (also known as a ternary operator).
- The condition checked is `n - k <= 1`.
  - If the condition `n - k <= 1` is true, it prints `n`.
  - Otherwise, it prints `1`.

### Explanation:
- To determine the output, we need to consider the relationship between `n` and `k`.
- If `n - k` is less than or equal to 1, then `n` will be printed.
- If `n - k` is greater than 1, then `1` will be printed.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output depends on the values of `n` and `k`. Since specific values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **n if n - k <= 1 else 1 (where n and k are integers obtained from the input)**
