The value of `t` is updated to be the integer division of its current value by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` are the new values provided by the input; `t` is now the value of `b` // 2; `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` is greater than 0; `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`; `i` is `i_end + 1`.**
