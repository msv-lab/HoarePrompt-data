The code snippet assigns the value of `b` to `t`. This means the new value of `t` will be whatever the value of `b` was before the assignment. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an integer; `b` is an integer representing the second input value; `t` is equal to `b`; `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` is greater than 0; `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`; `i` is `i_end + 2`.**
