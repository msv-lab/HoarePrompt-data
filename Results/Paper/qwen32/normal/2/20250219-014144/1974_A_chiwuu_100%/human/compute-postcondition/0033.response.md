The code snippet calculates `t2` as `a - t1`. Given the initial state, `t1` is already defined as `t * 15 - b * 4`. Therefore, `t2` will be `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`.

The values of `a`, `b`, `t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged except for the calculation of `t2`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` are the new values provided by the input; `t` is either `b // 2` if `t % 2 == 0` or `(b // 2) + 1` if `t % 2 != 0`; `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` is greater than 0; `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`; `i` is `i_end + 1`; `t2` is `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`**.
