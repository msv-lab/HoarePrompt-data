Postcondition: **`t` is updated based on whether `t2` is divisible by 15. If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`. `x` and `y` remain integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` remains greater than 0; `a` and `b` remain integers obtained from converting the original strings `a` and `b`; `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4` and remains less than `a`; `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.**
