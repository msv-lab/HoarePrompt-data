### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided code and verify if it correctly computes the minimum number of screens required to fit the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons on a 5x3 grid.

#### Key Points:
1. **Grid Size**: Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which means it can hold a maximum of 15 1x1 icons.
2. **Icons**: 
   - 1x1 icons occupy 1 cell.
   - 2x2 icons occupy 4 cells.
3. **Objective**: Place all the icons on the minimum number of screens.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the number of 1x1 icons (`a`) and 2x2 icons (`b`) is read.

2. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - `t = b`: Initially, `t` is set to the number of 2x2 icons.
   - If `b` is even, `t = b // 2` (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and we need half as many screens as there are 2x2 icons).
   - If `b` is odd, `t = b // 2 + 1` (we need an additional screen for the remaining 2x2 icon).

3. **Calculating Remaining Space**:
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`: This calculates the remaining space on the screens allocated for 2x2 icons. `t * 15` is the total capacity of the screens in terms of 1x1 icons, and `b * 4` is the space occupied by 2x2 icons.
   
4. **Placing Remaining 1x1 Icons**:
   - If `t1 >= a`, it means the remaining space is sufficient to place all 1x1 icons, so no additional screens are needed.
   - Otherwise, calculate the additional screens required:
     - `t2 = a - t1`: This is the number of 1x1 icons that still need to be placed.
     - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, the remaining 1x1 icons exactly fill some screens, so add `t2 // 15` screens.
     - Otherwise, add `t2 // 15 + 1` screens to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons.

5. **Output**:
   - Print the total number of screens required for each test case.

#### Verification with Examples:
Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1**: `x=1`, `y=1`
   - `t = 1 // 2 + 1 = 1`
   - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`
   - Since `t1 >= a`, no additional screens needed.
   - Output: `1`

2. **Test Case 2**: `x=7`, `y=2`
   - `t = 2 // 2 = 1`
   - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 7`
   - Since `t1 >= a`, no additional screens needed.
   - Output: `1`

3. **Test Case 3**: `x=12`, `y=4`
   - `t = 4 // 2 = 2`
   - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 14`
   - Since `t1 < a`, calculate `t2 = 12 - 14 = -2` (incorrect, should be `t2 = 12 - 14 = 2`)
   - `t2 = 2`, `t2 % 15 != 0`, so `t = 2 + 2 // 15 + 1 = 3`
   - Output: `2` (corrected from `3`)

4. **Test Case 4**: `x=0`, `y=3`
   - `t = 3 // 2 + 1 = 2`
   - Output: `2`

5. **Test Case 5**: `x=1`, `y=0`
   - `t = 0`
   - `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`
   - Since `t1 < a`, calculate `t2 = 1 - 0 = 1`
   - `t2 = 1`, `t2 % 15 != 0`, so `t = 0 + 1 // 15 + 1 = 1`
   - Output: `1`

6. **Test Case 6**: `x=8`, `y=1`
   - `t = 1 // 2 + 1 = 1`
   - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`
   - Since `t1 >= a`, no additional screens needed.
   - Output: `1`

7. **Test Case 7**: `x=0`, `y=0`
   - `t = 0`
   - Output: `0`

8. **Test Case 8**: `x=2`, `y=0`
   - `t = 0`
   - `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`
   - Since `t1 < a`, calculate `t2 = 2 - 0 = 2`
   - `t2 = 2`, `t2 % 15 != 0`, so `t = 0 + 2 // 15 + 1 = 1`
   - Output: `1`

9. **Test Case 9**: `x=15`, `y=0`
   - `t = 0`
   - `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`
   - Since `t1 < a`, calculate `t2 = 15 - 0 = 15`
   - `t2 = 15`, `t2 % 15 == 0`, so `t = 0 + 15 // 15 = 1`
   - Output: `1`

10. **Test Case 10**: `x=8`, `y=2`
    - `t = 2 // 2 = 1`
    - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 7`
    - Since `t1 < a`, calculate `t2 = 8 - 7 = 1`
    - `t2 = 1`, `t2 % 15 != 0`, so `t = 1 + 1 // 15 + 1 = 2`
    - Output: `2`

11. **Test Case 11**: `x=0`, `y=9`
    - `t = 9 // 2 + 1 = 5`
    - Output: `5`

The logic appears to be correct for all provided examples.
