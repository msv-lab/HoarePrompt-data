Postcondition: **`t` is now the value of `b` divided by 2 using integer division, and if `t` was originally even, it remains even; otherwise, it is incremented by 1. `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `a`; `b` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `b`; `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4` and is less than `a`. `t2` is calculated as `a - t1` and `t2` is divisible by 15.**
