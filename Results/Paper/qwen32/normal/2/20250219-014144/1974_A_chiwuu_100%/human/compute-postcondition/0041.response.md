The code snippet converts the string `a` to an integer. This affects the variable `a`, changing its type from a string to an integer. The other variables (`b`, `t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `t1`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an integer; `b` is a string representing the second input value; `t` is either `b // 2` if `t % 2 == 0` or `(b // 2) + 1` if `t % 2 != 0`, unless updated as specified; `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` is greater than 0; `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`; `i` is `i_end + 2`.**
