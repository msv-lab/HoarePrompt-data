The code snippet provided reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This does not affect the initial state of `t`, `x`, or `y` as they are part of the test cases and not directly manipulated by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` is an input integer.**
