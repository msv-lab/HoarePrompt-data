Postcondition: **`a` is an integer; `b` is an integer representing the second input value; `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `i_end + 2`. If `t % 2 == 0`, then `t` is `b // 2` and `t1` is `(b // 2) * 15 - b * 4`. Otherwise, `t` is `b // 2 + 1` and `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.**
