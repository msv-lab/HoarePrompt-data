The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

Given that the loop iterates from `0` to `n - 2` (inclusive), if `i` is currently `k`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we assume it to be `k` where `0 <= k < n - 1`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\), `n` is at least 2, `s` is the string provided by the user, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`, `lst` is a list containing its previous elements plus `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `mini` is \(10^8\), `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

However, since we need to provide a concrete state, let's assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, and thus at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`. If we consider the most general case where `i` could be any value from `0` to `n-2`, the next logical step would be to increment `i` by 1.

So, if `i` was `0` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\), `n` is at least 2, `s` is the string provided by the user, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`, `lst` is a list containing its previous elements plus `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `mini` is \(10^8\), `i` is 1**.

If `i` was `1` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `2`, and so on. The general form would be `i` is incremented by 1. For the sake of providing a concrete example, we assume `i` was `0` at the end of the previous iteration.

Final Answer:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\), `n` is at least 2, `s` is the string provided by the user, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`, `lst` is a list containing its previous elements plus `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `mini` is \(10^8\), `i` is 1**.
