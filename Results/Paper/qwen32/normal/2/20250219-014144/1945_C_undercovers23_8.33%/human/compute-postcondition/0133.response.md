The code snippet provided calculates the value of `c1` using the formula `o * 100 // n`. The variables `o` and `n` are not defined in the initial state, so their specific values are unknown. However, the calculation will assign a new value to `c1` based on these inputs.

The initial state specifies that `final` is a sorted list with no elements (length is 0) and that it contains elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` (which is `n // 2`) and the element is equal to `mini`. These conditions and the definition of `final` remain unchanged by the given code snippet.

Therefore, the only change in the output state is the assignment of a value to `c1`.

Output State: **`final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` (which is `n // 2`) and the element is equal to `mini`. The length of `final` is 0; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`.**
