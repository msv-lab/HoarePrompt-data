The given code snippet updates the value of `one_perc`. Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `one_perc` is recalculated using the formula `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

To provide a more specific output state, let's denote the new value of `one_perc` as `new_one_perc`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\), `n` is at least 2, `s` is the string provided by the user, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `lst` is a list containing its previous elements plus `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `mini` is \(10^8\), `i` is 2, `zero_perc` is \(\mathit{math.ceil}\left(\frac{\text{zero} \times 100}{3}\right)\), `one_perc` is `new_one_perc`, `z` is the count of '0's in `sl` incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `o` is the count of '1's in `sl` incremented by 1, and `one` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is not '0'**.

In simpler terms: The value of `one_perc` has been updated, while all other variables retain their previous values.
