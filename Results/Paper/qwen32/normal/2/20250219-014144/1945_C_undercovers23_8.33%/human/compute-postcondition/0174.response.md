Output State: **`final` is a sorted list; `t` is decremented by 1; `i` is 4; if `s[i]` was '0', `zero` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `one` is incremented by 1; `one` is now `one + 1`; `zero_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`; `one_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` includes `i + 1`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `one` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state descriptions.
