Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `mini` is 100000000; if `len(final) == 0`, then if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is a list containing the single element `0`, otherwise `final` is a sorted list containing the single element `n`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`; all elements of `lst` have been processed; `t` is decremented by 1; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the user's input; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of `'1'` in `sl`; `z` is the count of `'0'` in `sl`; `zero` is `0`; `one` is `0`; `lst` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))
    one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `mini` is 100000000; `len(final) == 0` if `c1 < 50` otherwise `final` contains the single element `0`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`; `t` is decremented by 1; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `s` is the user's input; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of `'1'` in `sl`; `z` is the count of `'0'` in `sl`; `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is `'0'`, otherwise `zero` is 0; `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is not `'0'`, otherwise `one` is 0; `lst` is a list containing the single element `i + 1` if `zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50`; `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))` and is greater than or equal to 50 if `zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50`; `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 if `zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `mini` is 100000000; `len(final) == 0` if `c1 < 50` otherwise `final` contains the single element `0`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`; `t` is decremented by 1; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `s` is the user's input; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of `'1'` in `sl`; `z` is the count of `'0'` in `sl` plus 1 if `s[i]` is `'0'`, otherwise `z` remains unchanged; `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is `'0'`, otherwise `zero` is 0; `one` is 1 if `s[i] is not `'0'` and `s[i-1]` was not `'0'`, otherwise `one` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is not `'0'`; `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`; `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`; `i` is incremented by 1`. If `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50`, `lst` contains the elements `i + 1` and `i + 1` if it initially contained only `i + 1` after the append. Otherwise, `lst` contains only `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `mini` is 100000000; `len(final) == 0` if `c1 < 50` otherwise `final` contains the single element `0`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`; `t` is decremented by 1; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `s` is the user's input; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of `'1'` in `sl`; `z` is the count of `'0'` in `sl` plus 1 if `s[i]` is `'0'`, otherwise `z` remains unchanged; `zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is `'0'`, otherwise `zero` remains unchanged; `one` is incremented by 1 if `s[i] is not `'0'`, otherwise `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is not `'0'` and `s[i-1]` was not `'0'`; `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`; `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`; `i` is `i + 1`. If `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50`, `lst` contains `i + 1` appended to its previous contents. Otherwise, `lst` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
