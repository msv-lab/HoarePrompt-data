Output State: **`final` is a list containing one element `[0]`; `t` has been decremented by `n - 1`; `zero` and `one` reflect counts of '0's and '1's; `lst` is unchanged; `mini` is unchanged; `c1` is `o * 100 // n` and `c1` is greater than or equal to 50.**

Natural Language Explanation: The `final` list now contains one element, which is `0`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
