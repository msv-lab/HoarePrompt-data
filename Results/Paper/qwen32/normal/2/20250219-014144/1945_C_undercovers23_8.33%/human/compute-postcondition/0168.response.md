Output State: **`final` is a sorted list; `t` is decremented by 1; `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration; if `s[i]` was '0', `zero` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `one` is incremented by 1; `zero_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `zero_perc` is now calculated as the ceiling of `zero` multiplied by 100 divided by `i + 1`. All other variables retain their previously described states.
