Output State: **`final` is a sorted list; `t` is decremented by 1; `i` is 4; if `s[i]` was '0', `zero` is incremented by either 1 or 2 depending on whether the if condition is true or false; `one` is incremented by 1 in the if part and by 2 in the else part; `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`; `one_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))` in both parts. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` includes `i + 1`. `one_perc` is updated to `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that `one_perc` is recalculated using the formula `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. All other variables retain their previous states and conditions.
