Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\), `n` is at least 2, `s` is the string provided by the user, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `lst` is a list containing its previous elements plus `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `mini` is \(10^8\), `i` is 2, `zero_perc` is \(\mathit{math.ceil}\left(\frac{\text{zero} \times 100}{3}\right)\), `one_perc` is `new_one_perc`, `z` is the count of '0's in `sl` incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `o` is the count of '1's in `sl` incremented by 1, and `one` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is not '0'. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` is updated to include `i + 1`.**
