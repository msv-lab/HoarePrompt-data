Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\); `n` is an input integer and `n` is even; `s` is the string provided by the user; `pk` is `n // 2`.**

Natural Language: The value of `pk` is now set to half of `n` (integer division). The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.
