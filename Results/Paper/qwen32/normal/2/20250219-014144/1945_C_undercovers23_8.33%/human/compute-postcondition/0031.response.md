The given code calculates the percentage of '1's in the remaining part of the string `s` excluding the current character at index `i`. Here's the updated state after executing the code:

- `one_perc` is recalculated using the formula `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

To express this in the required format:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\); `n` is at least 2; `s` is the string provided by the user; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `lst` is a list containing its previous elements plus `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50; `mini` is \(10^8\); `i` is 1; `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`; `z` is the count of '0's in `sl` incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `o` is the count of '1's in `sl` incremented by 1; `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.**
