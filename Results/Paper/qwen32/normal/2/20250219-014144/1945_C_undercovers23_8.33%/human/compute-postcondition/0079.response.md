The code snippet `o = sl.count('1')` counts the number of occurrences of the character `'1'` in the list `sl`. This affects the value of `o` but does not change any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`.
- If `len(final) == 0`, then if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is a list containing the single element `0`, otherwise `final` is a sorted list containing the single element `n`.
- `c1` is `o * 100 // n`.
- All elements of `lst` have been processed.
- `t` is decremented by 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is the user's input.
- `pk` is `n // 2`.
- `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`.

After executing the code snippet, the value of `o` changes to the count of `'1'` in `sl`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; if `len(final) == 0`, then if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is a list containing the single element `0`, otherwise `final` is a sorted list containing the single element `n`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`; all elements of `lst` have been processed; `t` is decremented by 1; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the user's input; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of `'1'` in `sl`.**
