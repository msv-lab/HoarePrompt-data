To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variable `mini`. The loop iterates over each element `ele` in the list `lst`, updating `mini` to be the minimum of its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `mini` starts with a value of \(10^8\).
   - `lst` is a list of indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each `ele` in `lst`, `mini` is updated to `min(mini, abs(pk - ele))`.
   - This means `mini` will hold the smallest absolute difference between `pk` and any index in `lst`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After all iterations, `mini` will contain the smallest absolute difference between `pk` and any index in `lst`.

Since the loop processes all elements in `lst`, the final value of `mini` will be the smallest `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`.

Thus, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`.**

This means that `mini` will hold the smallest distance from `pk` to any index in `lst` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, and `lst`) remain unchanged.
