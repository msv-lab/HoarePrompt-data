Postcondition: **`final` is a sorted list; if `final` was initially empty, it now contains either one element `[0]` if `c1` (which is `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, or the single element `n` if `c1` is less than 50; otherwise, `final` remains unchanged as a sorted list containing elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` (which is `n // 2`) and the element is equal to `mini`; `t` is decremented by 1; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the user's input string; `pk` is `n // 2`. Regardless of whether `n` is even or odd, the conditions described above hold true.**
