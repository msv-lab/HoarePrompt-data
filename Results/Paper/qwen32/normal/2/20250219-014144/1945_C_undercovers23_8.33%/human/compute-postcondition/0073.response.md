The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. This means `n` now holds the integer value provided by the user input. The other variables (`mini`, `final`, `c1`, `lst`, `t`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`. If `len(final) == 0`, then if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is a list containing the single element `0`. Otherwise, `final` is a sorted list containing the single element `n`. `c1` is `o * 100 // n`. All elements of `lst` have been processed, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer.**
