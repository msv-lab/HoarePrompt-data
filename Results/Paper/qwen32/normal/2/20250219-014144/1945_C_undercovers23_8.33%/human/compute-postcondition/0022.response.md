The code calculates `one_perc` using the formula `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. This modifies the value of `one_perc` while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\), `n` is at least 2, `s` is the string provided by the user, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is \(10^8\), `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.**
