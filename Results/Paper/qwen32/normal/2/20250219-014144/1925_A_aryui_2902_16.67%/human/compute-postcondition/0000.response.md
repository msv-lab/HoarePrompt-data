The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range, and `n` and `k` are also integers within specified ranges before the input operation. After the execution of the code, `n` and `k` will hold the values read from the input, while `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 676; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26.**
