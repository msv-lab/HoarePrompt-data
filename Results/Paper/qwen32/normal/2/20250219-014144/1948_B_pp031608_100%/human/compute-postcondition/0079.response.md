The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, the loop iterates from `m - 1` down to `1`. Since the loop decrements `i` in each iteration, we need to adjust `i` to be one less than its current value at the start of the next iteration.

Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `m - 2`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `m - 3`.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted:
- `i` should be `m - 3`.

Other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `arr`, `nums`, `ans`) are not part of the loop head and thus should remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input with `arr[i - 1]` set to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `i` is `m - 3`. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `ans` retains its previous value (which could be True or False). If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
