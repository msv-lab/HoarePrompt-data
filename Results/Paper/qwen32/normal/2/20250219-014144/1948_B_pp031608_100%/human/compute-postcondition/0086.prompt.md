Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99; `m` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `ans` is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input with `arr[i - 1]` set to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and `ans` is True unless it was previously set to False. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `ans` remains True unless it was already False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input with `arr[i - 1]` set to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `i` is `m - 2`. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `ans` retains its previous value (which could be True or False). If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99; `m` is at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input with `arr[i - 1]` set to `nums[0]`; `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`; `i` is `m - 3`. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `ans` retains its previous value. If `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]` and `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to `False` and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `ans` retains its previous value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
