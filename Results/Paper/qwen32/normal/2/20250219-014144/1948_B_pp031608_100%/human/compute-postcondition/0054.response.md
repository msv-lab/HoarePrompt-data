Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99; `m` is an input integer such that m ≥ 2; `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `i` is 1; `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[0]` followed by `arr[1]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
