Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input with `arr[i - 1]` set to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and `ans` is True unless it was previously set to False. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `ans` remains True unless it was already False.**
