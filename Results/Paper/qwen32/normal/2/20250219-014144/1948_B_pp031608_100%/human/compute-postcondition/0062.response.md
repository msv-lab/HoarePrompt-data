The given code snippet only sets the variable `ans` to `True`. This does not affect any other variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99; `m` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `ans` is True.**
