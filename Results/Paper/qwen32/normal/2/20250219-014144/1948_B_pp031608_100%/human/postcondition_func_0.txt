The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it checks a list of integers to determine if a specific condition is met: when any integer in the list is less than the preceding integer, the digits of the preceding integer along with the current integer should form a sorted sequence. If this condition holds for all such pairs in the list, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
