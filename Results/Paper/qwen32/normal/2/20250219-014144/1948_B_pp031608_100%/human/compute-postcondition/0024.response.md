Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99; `m` is an input integer and must be at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input line split and converted to integers; `i` is 1; `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[0]` followed by `arr[1]`; `ans` is False; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
