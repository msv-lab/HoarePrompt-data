The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `x`.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is `n-1` and `i` is `i + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `x`. Since `i` was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, we need to set `i` to its value at the start of the previous iteration plus 1.

So, if `i` was `i` at the start of the previous iteration, it became `i + 1` at the end. For the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 2`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 2` and `x` remains `n-1`.

State: **`s` is `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]`, `x` is `n-1`, `i` is `i + 2`**
