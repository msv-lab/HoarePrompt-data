Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), followed by two binary strings of length n representing the grid. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `a` is an empty list; `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(2):
    a.append(input())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list containing one binary string of length `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is a list containing two binary strings, where the first binary string is the original one of length `n`, and the second binary string is the newly appended binary string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is a list containing three binary strings, where the first binary string is the original one of length `n`, the second binary string is the first newly appended binary string, and the third binary string is the second newly appended binary string from the input; `_` is 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
