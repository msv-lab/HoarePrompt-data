To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `x`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]`
- `x` is `n-1`
- `t` is `n - i` if `a[0][:i + 1]` is equal to `s[:i + 1]`, otherwise `t` remains `1`
- `n` must be greater than 1

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_end`. Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_end + 1`.

Since `x` is `n-1` and does not change within the loop, it remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `s` remains `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]`
- `x` remains `n-1`
- `i` becomes `i_end + 1`
- `t` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i`: `t` is `n - (i_end + 1)` if `a[0][:i_end + 2]` is equal to `s[:i_end + 2]`, otherwise `t` remains `1`

Since we don't know the exact value of `i_end`, we'll represent the new value of `i` as `i + 1` where `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`s` is `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]`, `x` is `n-1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `t` is `n - (i + 1)` if `a[0][:i + 2]` is equal to `s[:i + 2]`, otherwise `t` remains `1`**
