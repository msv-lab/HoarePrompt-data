The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the current loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `s`, `x`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]`, `x` is `n-1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `t` is `n - i - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
