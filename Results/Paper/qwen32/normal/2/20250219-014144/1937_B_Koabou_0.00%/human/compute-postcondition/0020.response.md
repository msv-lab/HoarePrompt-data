Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list containing two binary strings each of length `n`, `s` is `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]`, `x` is the incremented value of `i`, and `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language Explanation: The values of the variables `n`, `a`, `s`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged except that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
