The code snippet concatenates the first `i + 1` characters of the first binary string in the list `a` with the substring of the second binary string starting from index `i` to the end. This results in a new string `s`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 before the code snippet, the value of `i` used in the slicing operation is the incremented value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list containing two binary strings each of length `n`, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is the concatenation of `a[0][:i + 1]` and `a[1][i:]`.**

In simpler terms, `s` is formed by taking the first `i + 1` characters from the first binary string and appending the rest of the second binary string starting from index `i`.
