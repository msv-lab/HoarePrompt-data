Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list containing two binary strings each of length `n`, `s` is either an empty list or a list containing the concatenated string `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]` if `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0', `x` is either 0 or `i` if the condition in the if statement is met, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement in the latter case.**
