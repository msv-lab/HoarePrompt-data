Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is a list containing two binary strings, where the first binary string is the first binary string of length `n` obtained from the input, and the second binary string is the second binary string of length `n` obtained from the input; `s` is an empty list; `x` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
        s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
        x = i
        break
else:
    s = a[0] + a[1][n - 1]
    x = n - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list containing two binary strings each of length `n`, `s` is either an empty list or a list containing the concatenated string `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]` if `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0', `x` is either 0 or `i` if the condition in the if statement is met, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement in the latter case.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list containing two binary strings each of length `n`. If `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0', then `s` is `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]`, `x` is set to the incremented value of `i`, and `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `s`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list containing two binary strings each of length `n`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0', then `s` is the concatenation of `a[0][:i + 1]` and `a[1][i:]`, and `x` is set to the value of `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
