The given code snippet creates a list named `nums` containing powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\). The initial state mentions that `t`, `n`, and `k` are integers, but these variables are not modified by the provided code snippet. Thus, their values remain unchanged.

The new variable `nums` is introduced and populated with the specified values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]**.
