The code appends a new value to the list `nums`. This new value is calculated as `k + nums[idx] + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input.
- `nums` is a list containing powers of 2 up to 1048576, followed by `k - nums[idx]` and `k + 1`.
- `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such power exists.

After executing the line `nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)`, the list `nums` will have one additional element at the end, which is `k + nums[idx] + 1`.

Therefore, the updated state of `nums` will include this new element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, `k + nums[idx] + 1`]; `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such power exists.**
