To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `nums`.

Given:
- The loop iterates over the indices of the list `nums`.
- The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
- The loop condition is based on the length of `nums`.
- The variable `idx` is set to `i - 1` and the loop breaks if `nums[i]` is greater than `k`.

From the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (this variable is not part of the loop head and does not need adjustment).
- `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input (these variables are not part of the loop head and do not need adjustment).
- `nums` is a predefined list of powers of 2 (this list does not change during the loop iterations).
- `idx` is either -1 or `i - 1` depending on the condition (this variable is not part of the loop head and does not need adjustment).

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, let's call it `i_prev`. For the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]; `i` is `i_prev + 1`; `idx` is -1 (or `i - 1` if the loop breaks in this iteration)**

Since we don't know the exact value of `i_prev` from the given information, we can represent the next state as:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]; `i` is `i + 1`; `idx` is -1**
