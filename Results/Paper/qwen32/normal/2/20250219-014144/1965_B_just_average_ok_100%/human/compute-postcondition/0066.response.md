To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the existing variables:

The code snippet is:
```python
nums.append(k - nums[idx])
```

This line appends a new element to the list `nums`. The new element is calculated as `k - nums[idx]`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input.
- `nums` is a predefined list of powers of 2.
- `idx` is the largest index `i` such that `nums[i] <= k`, or `-1` if no such index exists.

The value of `nums[idx]` is the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`. The new element being appended to `nums` is `k - nums[idx]`.

Since the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` are not changed by this operation, they remain as they were initially. The list `nums` now includes one additional element, which is `k - nums[idx]`.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, `k - nums[idx]`]; `idx` is the largest index `i` such that `nums[i] <= k`, or `-1` if no such index exists.**

In simpler terms, the list `nums` now includes an additional element which is the difference between `k` and the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
