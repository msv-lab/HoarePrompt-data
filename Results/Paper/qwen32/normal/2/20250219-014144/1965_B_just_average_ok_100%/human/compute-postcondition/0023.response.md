To determine the output of the `print(*nums)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the `nums` list step-by-step:

1. **Initialization of `nums` List**:
   - The `nums` list initially contains powers of 2 starting from \(2^0\) up to \(2^{21}\).
   - Additionally, it includes three more elements:
     - `k - nums[idx]`
     - `k + 1`
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`
   - The element `1 << idx` (which is equivalent to \(2^{idx}\)) is removed from the list.
   
2. **Determination of `idx`**:
   - `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - If no such element exists, `idx` is set to -1. However, since the list includes powers of 2 up to \(2^{21}\), `idx` should always be between 0 and 21 inclusive.

3. **Constructing the Final `nums` List**:
   - Start with the list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{21}\).
   - Add the three additional elements: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - Remove the element at index `idx` (which is \(2^{idx}\)).

Given this process, the final `nums` list will contain:
- All powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{21}\) except \(2^{idx}\).
- The three additional elements: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, `k + nums[idx] + 1`.

### Example Calculation
Let's consider an example where `k = 10`:
- The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 10 is \(2^3 = 8\). So, `idx = 3`.
- The `nums` list initially contains: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`.
- Additional elements: `10 - 8 = 2`, `10 + 1 = 11`, `10 + 8 + 1 = 19`.
- Remove `2^3 = 8` from the list.
- Final `nums` list: `[1, 2, 4, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2, 11, 19]`.

### General Output Description
The `print(*nums)` statement will print all elements of the `nums` list, which includes:
- All powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{21}\) except \(2^{idx}\).
- The three additional elements: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, `k + nums[idx] + 1`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of the elements in the list. However, we can describe the structure of the list based on the given conditions.

Output: **All powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{21}\) except \(2^{idx}\), followed by \(k - nums[idx]\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + nums[idx] + 1\) (where \(idx\) is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`)**
