The code appends a new value to the `nums` list. This new value is calculated as `k + nums[idx] + 1`. Since `idx` is the largest index `i` such that `nums[i] <= k`, `nums[idx]` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.

After appending the new value, the `nums` list will now contain one additional element. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `idx` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, `k + 1`, `k + nums[idx] + 1`]; `idx` is the largest index `i` such that `nums[i] <= k`, or `-1` if no such index exists.**
