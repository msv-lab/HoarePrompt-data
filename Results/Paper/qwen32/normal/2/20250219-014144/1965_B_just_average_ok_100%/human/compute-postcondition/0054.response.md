The code assigns the value of `i - 1` to the variable `idx`. Given that `idx` was initially -1 and `nums[i]` is greater than `k`, the only variable that changes is `idx`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]; `idx` is `i - 1`; the current element `nums[i]` is greater than `k`.**
