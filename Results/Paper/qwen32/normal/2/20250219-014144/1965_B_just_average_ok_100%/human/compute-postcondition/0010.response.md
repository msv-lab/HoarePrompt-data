The code snippet `idx = i - 1` updates the value of `idx` to be one less than the current value of `i`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 before this line, we assume `i` has already been incremented. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]; `i` is incremented by 1; `idx` is `i - 1`.**
