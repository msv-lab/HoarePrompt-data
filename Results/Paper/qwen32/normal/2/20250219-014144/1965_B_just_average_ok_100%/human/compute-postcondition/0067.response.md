The code appends `k + 1` to the list `nums`. This means the last element of `nums` changes from `k - nums[idx]` to `k + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, `k + 1`]; `idx` is the largest index `i` such that `nums[i] <= k`, or `-1` if no such index exists.**
