The value of `l` is incremented by 1. Initially, `l` is 2 if `j` is 'A', otherwise `l` is 1. After incrementing, `l` becomes 3 if `j` is 'A', otherwise `l` becomes 2.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32, `i` is 2, `a` is a non-empty string, `j` is the third character in `a`, `l` is 3 if `j` is 'A', otherwise `l` is 2, and `h` is 1 if `j` is 'A', otherwise `h` is 2.**
