Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32, `i` is 0, `a` is the string input by the user, `l` is the number of 'A's in `a`, and `h` is the number of non-'A' characters in `a`. If `l` is greater than `h`, then `l` is indeed greater than `h`. Otherwise, `l` is less than or equal to `h`.**
