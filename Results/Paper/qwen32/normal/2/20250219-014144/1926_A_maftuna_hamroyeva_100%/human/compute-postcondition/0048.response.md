Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32, `i` is 1, `a` is the input string, `l` is the number of 'A' characters in `a`, and `h` is the number of characters in `a` that are not 'A'. If `l` is greater than `h`, then `l` is indeed greater than `h`. Otherwise, `l` is less than or equal to `h`.**
