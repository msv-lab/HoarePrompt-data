Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input, such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32, and for each of the `t` test cases, there is a string of length 5 consisting only of the letters 'A' and 'B'. All `t` strings are distinct.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input. The condition that `t` is between 1 and 32 inclusive remains valid. The information about the test cases (strings of length 5 consisting only of 'A' and 'B', and being distinct) is still valid but unchanged by this line of code.
