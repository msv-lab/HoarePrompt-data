The code snippet `y = n - 1 - i` assigns the value of `n - 1 - i` to the variable `y`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `r`, and `rem` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2
- `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`
- `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`

After executing the code snippet, the new value of `y` is `n - 1 - i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`**.
