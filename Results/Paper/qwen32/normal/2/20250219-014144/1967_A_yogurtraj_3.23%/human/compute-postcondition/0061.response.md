The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and since the loop is about to start another iteration, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Given the conditions and the loop head, here's how we adjust the state:

- `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `r`, `rem`, `y`, `ii`, and `a`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is either 0 or `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is either `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` or `a[i + 1]`, `rem` is either `k % (i + 1)` or 0, `y` is either `n - 1 - i` or 0, `ii` is the current value of `ii` plus 1, `a` is the sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1**.
