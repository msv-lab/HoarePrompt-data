Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is either 0 or `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is either `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` or `a[i + 1]`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)` or 0, `y` is either `n - 1 - i` or 0, `ii` is the current value of `ii` plus 1, `a` is the sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 2. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `k` becomes 0, `r` becomes `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, and `r` becomes `a[i + 1]`.**
