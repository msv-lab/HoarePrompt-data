Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, `ii` is the current value of `ii` plus 1, `a` is the sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
