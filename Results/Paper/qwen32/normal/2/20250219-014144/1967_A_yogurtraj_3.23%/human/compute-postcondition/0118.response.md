The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables; it only terminates the innermost loop or conditional structure it is contained within. Therefore, none of the variables `n`, `a`, `ii`, `i`, `r`, `rem`, `y`, or `k` are modified.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ii` retains its previous value, `i` is `i + 2`, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, `k` is 0.**
