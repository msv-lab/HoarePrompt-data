The code assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to the variable `r`. The values of `n`, `a`, `ii`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ii` retains its previous value, `i` is `i + 2`, `k` is `k - ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]))`, `r` is `a[i + 1]`.**
