Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step to determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`r` is `a[n - 1]`**: This means `r` is the last element of the list `a`.
2. **`rem` is 0**: The variable `rem` is explicitly set to 0.
3. **`y` is 0**: The variable `y` is explicitly set to 0.
4. **`k` is reduced by the sum of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `n - 2`**: This part modifies the value of `k`, but it does not affect the print statement directly since `k` is then set to 0.
5. **`k` is equal to 0**: The variable `k` is explicitly set to 0 after the reduction.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)
```

Let's substitute the known values into this expression:
- `r` is `a[n - 1]` (the last element of the list `a`).
- `rem` is 0.
- `y` is 0.
- `k` is not used in the print statement, so its value does not matter here.

So the expression simplifies to:
```python
print((a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 1 + 0 + 0)
```
Which further simplifies to:
```python
print((a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 1)
```

### Final Output Description:
The output of the print statement is dependent on the value of `a[n - 1]` and `n`. Since the specific values of `a[n - 1]` and `n` are not provided, we can only express the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 1 (where a[n - 1] is the last element of the list `a` and `n` is the length of the list `a`)**
