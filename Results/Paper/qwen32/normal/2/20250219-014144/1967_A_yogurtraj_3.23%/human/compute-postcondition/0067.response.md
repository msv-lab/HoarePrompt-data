Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is either `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` or `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is either `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` or `a[i + 1]`, `rem` is either `k % (i + 1)` or 0, `y` is either `n - 1 - i` or 0, `ii` is the current value of `ii` plus 1, `a` is the sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1**.

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
