Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, here's the output state:

The variable `r` is assigned the value of `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 before this line, the value of `r` will be calculated using the new value of `i`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`**.
