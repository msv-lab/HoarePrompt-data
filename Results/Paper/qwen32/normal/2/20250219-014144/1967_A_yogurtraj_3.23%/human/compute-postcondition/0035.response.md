Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, `k` is 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, and `r` is `a[i + 1]`.**
