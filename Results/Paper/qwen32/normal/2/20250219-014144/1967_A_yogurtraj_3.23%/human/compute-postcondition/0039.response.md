Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. This variable represents the number of test cases but does not affect the current print statement directly.
2. **`n`**: The first integer read from the input, representing the number of elements in the list `a`.
3. **`k`**: Initially, `k` is some integer. It is then updated based on the formula `k = k - sum((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) for i in range(n - 1))`. After this update, `k` is guaranteed to be non-zero.
4. **`a`**: A sorted list of integers read from the input.
5. **`r`**: Calculated as `a[n - 1] + k // n`. Here, `a[n - 1]` is the last element of the sorted list `a`, and `k // n` is the integer division of `k` by `n`.
6. **`rem`**: Initialized to 0. Not used in the print statement.
7. **`y`**: Initialized to 0. Not used in the print statement.

### Code Snippet Analysis:

The print statement is:
```python
print((r - 1) * n + 1)
```

Let's substitute the value of `r` into the expression:
- `r = a[n - 1] + k // n`
- Therefore, `(r - 1) * n + 1` becomes `((a[n - 1] + k // n) - 1) * n + 1`
- Simplifying further: `(a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1`
- Which is equivalent to: `(a[n - 1] * n + k // n * n - n) + 1`
- Further simplification: `a[n - 1] * n + k - n + 1`

### Final Output:

The expression `(r - 1) * n + 1` evaluates to `a[n - 1] * n + k - n + 1`.

Thus, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **a[n - 1] * n + k - n + 1 (where a[n - 1] is the last element of the sorted list a, k is the updated value after the summation, and n is the number of elements in the list a)**
