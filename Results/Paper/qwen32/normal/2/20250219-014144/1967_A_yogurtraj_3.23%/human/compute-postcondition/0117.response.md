Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ii` retains its previous value, `i` is `i + 2`, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, `k` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is set to 0. All other variables retain their previous values or expressions as described in the initial state.
