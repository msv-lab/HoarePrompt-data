To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `i`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(0, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the state was:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2
- `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input
- The loop control variable `i` was used in the calculations and conditions within the loop.

Since the loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `n-2` (inclusive), the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to start the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` remains the same as it is not part of the loop head.
- `n` remains the same as it is not part of the loop head.
- `a` remains the same as it is not part of the loop head.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is incremented by 1**
