The code reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
