The code assigns the remainder of `k` divided by `(i + 1)` to the variable `rem`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, `ii`, `i`, or `r`. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `rem`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ii` retains its previous value, `i` is `i + 2`, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`**.
