Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is updated to `k - sum((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) for i in range(n - 1))` and `k` is equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `r` is `a[n - 1]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0.**
