The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. This means the values of `n` and `k` will be updated based on the input, while other variables remain unchanged unless they are affected by subsequent code.

Given the initial state, the only variables that are affected by this code snippet are `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `r` is set to `a[n - 1] + k // n` if `k` is not equal to 0; otherwise, `r` remains `a[n - 1]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is the current value of `ii` plus 1**.
