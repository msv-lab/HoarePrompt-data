The code snippet assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to the variable `r`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is `a[i + 1]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is the current value of `ii` plus 1, `a` is the sorted list of integers read from the input, and `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is less than or equal to `k`.**
