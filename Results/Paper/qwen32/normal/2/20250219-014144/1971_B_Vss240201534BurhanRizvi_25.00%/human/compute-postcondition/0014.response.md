Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is an integer such that 0 < t â‰¤ 1000.
  - `s` is the string input by the user.
  - `s2` is a permutation of the string `s`. If `s` is not equal to `s2`, then `s` and `s2` are different permutations of each other. Otherwise, `s` is equal to `s2`.

- **Code Snippet:**
  ```python
  print('No')
  ```

The print statement simply outputs the string `'No'`. The values of `t`, `s`, and `s2` do not affect the output of this specific print statement because it does not reference these variables.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **No**
