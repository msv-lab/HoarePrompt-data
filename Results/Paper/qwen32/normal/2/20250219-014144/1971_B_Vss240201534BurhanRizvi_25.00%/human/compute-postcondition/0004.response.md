Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's analyze the situation:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `s` is a string input by the user.
- `s2` is a permutation of the string `s`, meaning it contains the same characters as `s` but possibly in a different order.
- `s` is not equal to `s2`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print('Yes')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `s`, or `s2`. It simply outputs the string `'Yes'`.

Therefore, regardless of the values of `t`, `s`, or `s2`, the output will always be the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
