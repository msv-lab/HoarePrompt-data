The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over the elements in the list `sChar`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `sChar`. Since `sChar` must contain at least two strings, after the first iteration, there will still be at least one string left to iterate over.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the first string in `sChar`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should now be the second string in `sChar`.

State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0's and '1's, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, the total length of all strings in `sChar` does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `sChar` must contain at least two strings; `s` is a list containing two elements, both equal to the first string in `sChar`; `i` is the second string in `sChar`.**
