Output State: **`right` is the smallest index such that `right >= len(s)` or `s[right] == '0'`, `left` is 1, `s` and `cost` remain unchanged unless the swap condition is met outside the loop.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `left` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. The conditions for `right` and the unchanged nature of `s` and `cost` remain as specified in the initial state.
