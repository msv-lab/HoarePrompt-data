### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated version to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap
We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted. We need to find the minimum total cost to achieve this.

#### Program Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - The input string `sChar` is converted to a list `s`.
   - Two pointers, `left` and `right`, are initialized to 0 and 1, respectively.
   - A variable `cost` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the total cost.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop runs as long as `left <= right`, `right < len(s)`, and `left < len(s)`.
   - If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', the characters at these positions are swapped, and the cost is incremented by `right - left + 1`.
   - The `right` pointer is incremented until it points to a '0'.
   - The `left` pointer is incremented until it points to a '1'.

3. **Loop Condition**:
   - The condition `left <= right` can indeed lead to an infinite loop or incorrect behavior if `left` and `right` do not move correctly. Specifically, if `left` and `right` point to the same position and both are '1' or '0', the loop will not terminate properly.

4. **Sorting Strategy**:
   - The program attempts to swap '1's with '0's directly adjacent to each other, but this approach does not guarantee that the entire string will be sorted. It also does not consider the minimum cost required to sort the entire string.

5. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost calculation is flawed because it only considers direct swaps between '1's and '0's. The actual minimum cost might involve more complex cyclic shifts that the program does not account for.

#### Annotations Validation
The annotations provided seem to reflect the intended logic of the program but do not address the fundamental issues with the sorting strategy and cost calculation.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the program does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string. The issues identified in the original assessment are valid, and the program fails to handle the problem requirements accurately.

**Final: False**
