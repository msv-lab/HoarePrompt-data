Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find the minimum cost required to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. A cyclic shift involves moving the last character of a substring to the front of that substring. The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a binary string. For each string, it calls `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost to sort the string.

#### Function `func_1`
- **Initialization**: 
  - `s` is converted from a string to a list of characters.
  - `left` and `right` pointers are initialized to 0 and 1, respectively.
  - `cost` is initialized to 0.
  
- **Main Loop**:
  - The loop continues as long as `left <= right`, `right < len(s)`, and `left < len(s)`.
  - If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', the characters at these positions are swapped, and the cost is incremented by `right - left + 1`.
  - The `right` pointer is moved forward until it points to a '0'.
  - The `left` pointer is moved forward until it points to a '1'.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost calculation is flawed because it only considers swapping '1's with '0's directly adjacent to each other. This does not account for the minimum cost required to sort the entire string.
   
2. **Inefficient Sorting Strategy**:
   - The program does not guarantee that the string will be sorted after the operations. It only swaps '1's and '0's when they are adjacent, which may not result in a fully sorted string.

3. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The loop condition `left <= right` is problematic because it can lead to an infinite loop or incorrect behavior if `left` and `right` pointers do not move correctly.
   - The program does not handle cases where there are multiple '1's and '0's that need to be rearranged in a specific order to achieve a sorted string.

### Correctness
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string as per the problem requirements.

**Correctness: False**
