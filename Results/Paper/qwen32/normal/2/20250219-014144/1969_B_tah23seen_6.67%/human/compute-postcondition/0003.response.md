The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over the elements of `sChar`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on whether there are more elements in `sChar` to iterate over.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the last element of `sChar`. For the loop to execute one more time, `sChar` must have at least one more element beyond the current `i`.

Given the conditions:
- `sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0's and '1's.
- The length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5.
- The total length of all strings in `sChar` does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
- `sChar` must contain at least one string.
- `s` is a list containing one element `i`.

We need to ensure that `sChar` has another string for `i` to iterate over in the next loop iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `sChar` contains at least one more string.

State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0's and '1's, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, the total length of all strings in `sChar` does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `sChar` must contain at least two strings; `s` is a list containing one element `i` which is the first string in `sChar`.**
