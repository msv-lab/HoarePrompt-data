Postcondition: **`left` is the index of the next '1' in `s` starting from its current position, or the length of `s` if no '1' is found, ensuring `left` is less than `len(s)` and `left <= right`. `right` remains unchanged. `s` remains unchanged unless `s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1'`, in which case the characters at indices `left` and `right` are swapped, and `cost` is incremented by `right - left + 1`.**
