Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `sChar`, which is a list of strings where each string consists only of '0's and '1's, and the length of each string is between 2 and 2 * 10^5. The total length of all strings in `sChar` does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The function calculates and returns the total accumulated cost of swaps needed to achieve a specific configuration of '0's and '1's in the strings.**
