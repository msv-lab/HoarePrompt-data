To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition:

```python
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will continue as long as two conditions are met:
  1. `left < len(s)`
  2. `s[left] != '1'`

### Current State:
- `sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0's and '1's, and the length of each string `s` satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `s` is a list containing all the elements from `sChar` in the same order with `s[0]` being '0'.
- `left` is 1.
- `right` is the position of the first '0' in `s` or the length of `s` if no '0' is found.

### Conditions to Meet for the Loop to Execute Again:
1. **Condition 1**: `left < len(s)`
   - This condition is already satisfied because `left` is 1, and `s[0]` is '0', meaning `len(s)` is at least 1 (and likely much larger).

2. **Condition 2**: `s[left] != '1'`
   - For the loop to execute again, the character at position `left` in `s` should not be '1'. Since `left` is currently 1, `s[1]` should be '0'.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `s[1]` is '0'.

### Conclusion:
No other states need to be adjusted because the conditions only involve `left` and `s[left]`.

### Final State:
State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0's and '1's, and the length of each string `s` satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\); `s` is a list containing all the elements from `sChar` in the same order with `s[0]` being '0' and `s[1]` being '0'; `left` is 1; `right` is the position of the first '0' in `s` or the length of `s` if no '0' is found.**
