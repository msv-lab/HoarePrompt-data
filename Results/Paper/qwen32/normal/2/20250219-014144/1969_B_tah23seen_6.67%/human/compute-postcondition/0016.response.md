To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head:

```python
while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will execute if both conditions are true:
1. `right < len(s)`
2. `s[right] != '0'`

Let's analyze the given state:
- `sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0's and '1's, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5.
- `s` is a list containing all the elements from `sChar` in the same order.
- `left` is 0.
- `right` is 1.
- The cost calculation logic is not relevant to the loop condition.

Given these details, let's break down the conditions:
1. `right < len(s)`: Since `right` is initialized to 1, this condition will be true as long as `len(s)` is at least 2.
2. `s[right] != '0'`: This condition requires that the element at index `right` (which is 1) in the list `s` should not be '0'.

Since `s` is constructed from `sChar`, and `sChar` contains strings of '0's and '1's with lengths between 2 and 2 * 10^5, it is possible for `s` to have a length of at least 2. However, to ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `s[1]` is not '0'.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `s[1]` is '1'. 

State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0's and '1's, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5; `s` is a list containing all the elements from `sChar` in the same order, with `s[1]` being '1'; `left` is 0; `right` is 1**.
