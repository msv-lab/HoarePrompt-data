The value of `right` is incremented by 1. Initially, `right` was 3, so now `right` is 4. The other variables (`sChar`, `s`, `left`, and the condition `len(s) > 2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0's and '1's, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5; `s` is a list containing all the elements from `sChar` in the same order, with `s[1]` being '1', `s[2]` being '1', and `s[3]` being '1'; `left` is 0; `right` is 4; `len(s) > 2`.**
