Output State: **`left` is the index of the first '1' in `s`; `right` is the index of the first '1' in `s` plus 1; `s` must contain at least one '1'**

Explanation: The value of `right` is incremented by 1, while `left` remains unchanged. The precondition that `s` contains at least one '1' and the definition of `left` as the index of the first '1' in `s` are still valid.
