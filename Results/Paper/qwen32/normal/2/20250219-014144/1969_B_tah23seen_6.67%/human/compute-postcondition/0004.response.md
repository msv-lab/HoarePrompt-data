The code appends the first string in `sChar` (which is stored in `i`) to the list `s`. Since `s` initially contains one element `i`, after appending `i` again, `s` will contain two identical elements, both being the first string in `sChar`.

Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0's and '1's, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, the total length of all strings in `sChar` does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `sChar` must contain at least two strings; `s` is a list containing two elements, both equal to the first string in `sChar`.**
