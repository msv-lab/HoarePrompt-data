Output State: **`left` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not '1', incremented by 2, and `s[left-1]` is not '1'**
This means that `left` has been incremented by 1, so it now points to the next character in the string `s` after the one that was initially not '1'. The condition that `s[left]` is not '1' still holds, but now it refers to the new position of `left`.
