Functionality: **The function takes a list of binary strings (`sChar`) and calculates the total cost required to rearrange each string such that all '0's come before all '1's. The cost is determined by the number of swaps needed to achieve this configuration, and the function returns the accumulated cost for all strings in the list.**
