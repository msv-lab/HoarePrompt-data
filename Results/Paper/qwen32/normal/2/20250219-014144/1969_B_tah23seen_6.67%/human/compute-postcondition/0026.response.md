The value of `left` is incremented by 1. Initially, `left` is 1, so after the increment, `left` becomes 2. The values of `sChar`, `s`, and `right` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0's and '1's, and the length of each string `s` satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\); `s` is a list containing all the elements from `sChar` in the same order with `s[0]` being '0' and `s[1]` being '0'; `left` is 2; `right` is the position of the first '0' in `s` or the length of `s` if no '0' is found.**
