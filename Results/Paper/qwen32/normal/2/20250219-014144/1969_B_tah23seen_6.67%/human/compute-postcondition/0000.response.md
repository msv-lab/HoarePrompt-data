The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `s`. This operation does not affect the existing variable `sChar` which is described in the initial state.

Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0's and '1's, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, the total length of all strings in `sChar` does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `s` is an empty list.**
