To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information:

- We have a variable named `result`.
- The value of `result` is described as "the element at position `t + 1` in `results`".

Given this, the output of the `print(result)` statement will depend on the values of `t` and `results`. Since the specific values of `t` and `results` are not provided, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `result`.

However, we can describe the output precisely based on the given information:

Output: **result (where result is the element at position t + 1 in the results list)**
