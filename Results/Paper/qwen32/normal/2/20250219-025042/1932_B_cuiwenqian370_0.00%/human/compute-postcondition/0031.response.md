Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `path`, which is a string representing a sequence of space-separated integers where each integer \( a_i \) (1 ≤ \( a_i \) ≤ 10^6) represents the periodicity of a sign, and `n`, which is an integer (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 100) representing the number of signs. The function returns a value based on the given periodicities and the number of signs. However, the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information.**
