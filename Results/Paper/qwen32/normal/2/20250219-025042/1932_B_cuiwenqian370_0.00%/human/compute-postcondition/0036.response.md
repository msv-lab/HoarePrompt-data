Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes a parameter `path`, which is a list or string of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*'. It returns 0 if the `path` is empty. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the maximum score possible by traversing the `path`, where each '@' contributes 1 to the score and each '*' results in an invalid position represented by `-inf`. The score is determined by considering the maximum score up to each position, excluding invalid positions.**
