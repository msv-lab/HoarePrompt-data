Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the result for each test case. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `path`. The string `path` contains space-separated integers representing the periodicity of signs. For each test case, the function computes a result using another function `func_1` and prints this result.**
