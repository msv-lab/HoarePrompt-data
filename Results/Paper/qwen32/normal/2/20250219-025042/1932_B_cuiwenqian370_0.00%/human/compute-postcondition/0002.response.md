`t` is assigned the integer value of the first element in the `data` list. Since `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the original `path` string, `data[0]` is the first integer in string form from `path`. Converting this to an integer gives us the value of `t`.

Output State: **`path` is a string representing a sequence of space-separated integers; `n` is an integer; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the original `path` string; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`.**
