The code assigns the value of `data[index]` to `path`. Given that `index` is 2, `path` will now hold the value of the third element in the `data` list (since list indices start at 0).

Output State: **`path` is the string value of the third element in `data`, `n` is the integer value of the second element in `data`, `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the original `path` string, `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0, `index` is 2, `results` is an empty list.**
