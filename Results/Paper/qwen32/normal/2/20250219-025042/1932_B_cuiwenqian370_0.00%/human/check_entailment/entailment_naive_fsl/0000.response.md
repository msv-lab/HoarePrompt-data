Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not match the problem description at all. The problem requires calculating the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on the periodicity of each sign. However, the provided code seems to be solving a different problem related to a path with '@' and '*' characters, which is unrelated to the given problem.

Here's a brief analysis of why the code is incorrect:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function appears to be designed to solve a problem involving paths with '@' and '*' characters, possibly counting the maximum number of '@' characters in a valid path. It does not handle the periodicity of signs or calculate the year in which the n-th sign will occur.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads input data and applies `func_1` to each test case. Since `func_1` is not relevant to the problem, applying it here does not solve the required problem.

To solve the actual problem, we need to simulate the occurrence of each sign sequentially based on its periodicity. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_apocalypse_year(signs):
    current_year = 0
    for period in signs:
        # Find the next occurrence of the sign after the current year
        next_occurrence = ((current_year // period) + 1) * period
        current_year = next_occurrence
    return current_year

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        periods = list(map(int, data[index:index+n]))
        index += n
        results.append(find_apocalypse_year(periods))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Uncomment the following line to run the main function when testing locally
# main()
```

This corrected version reads the input, calculates the year for each test case using the `find_apocalypse_year` function, and prints the results. The `find_apocalypse_year` function correctly simulates the sequential occurrence of each sign based on its periodicity.
