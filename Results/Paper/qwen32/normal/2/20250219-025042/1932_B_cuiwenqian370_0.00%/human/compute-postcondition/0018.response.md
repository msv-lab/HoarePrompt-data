The code snippet `n = int(data[index])` updates the value of `n` by converting the string at the index specified by the `index` variable in the `data` list to an integer.

Given the initial state:
- `path` is the string value of the fifth element in `data`.
- `n` is the integer value of the fourth element in `data`.
- `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the original `path` string.
- `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 2 and must be greater than 0.
- `index` is 5.
- `results` contains two elements, both of which are the result of `func_1(path)`.

After executing the code snippet, `n` is updated to be the integer value of the sixth element in `data` (since `index` is 5).

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`path` is the string value of the fifth element in `data`; `n` is the integer value of the sixth element in `data`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the original `path` string; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 2 and must be greater than 0; `index` is 5; `results` contains two elements, both of which are the result of `func_1(path)`.**
