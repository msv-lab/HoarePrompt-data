To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information:

- We have a variable named `result` which is defined as the element at position `t` in the list `results`.

Given this information, the `print(result)` statement will output the value of the element located at index `t` within the `results` list.

However, since the specific contents of the `results` list and the value of `t` are not explicitly provided, we cannot determine the exact value that will be printed. Instead, we can describe the output in terms of the variables provided.

Output: **result (where result is the element at position t in the results list)**
