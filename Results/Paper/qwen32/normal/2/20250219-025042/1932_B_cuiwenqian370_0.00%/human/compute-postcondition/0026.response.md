In the given task, the for loop iterates over the `results` list. The loop head only contains the variable `result`, which means we can only adjust the state of `result` for the next iteration. However, since `result` is an element from the `results` list, and `results` is not being modified within the loop, the state of `results` itself cannot be changed directly.

Given that the loop iterates over `results`, the next iteration would involve moving to the next element in `results`. Therefore, the state of `result` would reflect the next element in the `results` list.

Let's break it down:

- The current state indicates that `results` contains `t` elements.
- The loop has already processed the first `t-1` elements of `results`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, there should be another element in `results` to process.

Since `results` contains `t` elements and the loop has processed `t-1` elements, the loop will execute one more time if `t` is incremented by 1, meaning `results` should contain `t+1` elements.

However, the problem specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, and the loop head only includes `result`. Thus, we can't directly change the size of `results`.

Instead, we can infer that the next state of `result` would be the next element in `results`, which corresponds to the result of `func_1(path)` for the next `path` value.

Given that `t` must be at least 1 and `results` contains `t` elements, the next iteration would involve `t` being incremented to `t+1`, and `result` being the next element in `results`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`path` is the string value of the element at position `2 * (t + 1) + 1` in `data`; `n` is the integer value of the element at position `2 * (t + 1)` in `data`; `data` remains unchanged; `t` is at least 1; `index` is `2 * (t + 1) + 1`; `results` contains `t + 1` elements, each of which is the result of `func_1(path)` for each respective `path`; `result` is the element at position `t` in `results`**.

However, strictly adhering to the requirement to only adjust the state of objects in the loop head (`result`), the state would be:

State: **`result` is the element at position `t` in `results`**.

But to provide a more complete context, we can include the inferred changes:

State: **`path` is the string value of the element at position `2 * (t + 1) + 1` in `data`; `n` is the integer value of the element at position `2 * (t + 1)` in `data`; `data` remains unchanged; `t` is at least 1; `index` is `2 * (t + 1) + 1`; `results` contains `t + 1` elements, each of which is the result of `func_1(path)` for each respective `path`; `result` is the element at position `t` in `results`**.

Given the strict requirement:

State: **`result` is the element at position `t` in `results`**.
