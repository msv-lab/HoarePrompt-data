To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the formula for `ans`.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `n`: The first integer from the input.
- `m`: The second integer from the input.
- `a`: Remains unchanged (value not specified).
- `s`: A non-empty string (value not specified).
- `p`: The string `'ABCDEF'`.
- `hmp`: A `Counter` object representing the frequency of each character in `s`.
- `t`: Has been incremented by 1 six times (so `t` is 6, but this value is not used in the calculation of `ans`).
- `ans`: Calculated as `6 * m` plus the sum of `(m - hmp[i])` for all characters `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i] < m`.

### Calculation of `ans`:
1. **Base Calculation**: `6 * m`
2. **Additional Sum**: For each character `i` in `hmp` (which represents the frequency of characters in `s`), if `hmp[i] < m`, add `(m - hmp[i])` to the total.

Let's denote:
- `total_additional_sum` as the sum of `(m - hmp[i])` for all characters `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i] < m`.

So, `ans = 6 * m + total_additional_sum`.

### Example Calculation:
To illustrate, let's assume:
- `m = 3`
- `s = "aabbc"` (for example purposes)

Then:
- `hmp = {'a': 2, 'b': 2, 'c': 1}`

For each character in `hmp`:
- For 'a': `hmp['a'] = 2` which is not less than `m = 3`, so no contribution.
- For 'b': `hmp['b'] = 2` which is not less than `m = 3`, so no contribution.
- For 'c': `hmp['c'] = 1` which is less than `m = 3`, so contribution is `(3 - 1) = 2`.

Thus, `total_additional_sum = 2`.

Finally:
- `ans = 6 * 3 + 2 = 18 + 2 = 20`

### General Case:
Without specific values for `m` and `s`, we can describe `ans` in terms of these variables:

- `ans` is `6 * m` plus the sum of `(m - hmp[i])` for all characters `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i] < m`.

### Final Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is 6 * m plus the sum of (m - hmp[i]) for all characters i in hmp where hmp[i] < m)**
