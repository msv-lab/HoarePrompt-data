The value of `index` is incremented by `n`. Therefore, `index` becomes `2 + n`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[2]` to `data[n+1]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the `input` content by whitespace, `index` is `2 + n`, `t` is an integer value greater than 0, `results` is an empty list.**
