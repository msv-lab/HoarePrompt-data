The code snippet `data = input().split()` reads a line from the standard input and splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace. This means that `data` will now contain the input values as strings.

Given the initial state, `n` is a positive integer and `p` is a list of `n` integers. The variable `input` contains the entire input content read from standard input. After executing the code snippet, `data` will be a list of strings corresponding to the input values.

Since the exact input values are not specified, we can only describe the transformation of the `input` variable into the `data` variable.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a`, where `|p_i| <= n` for each element `p_i` in `p`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the `input` content by whitespace.**
