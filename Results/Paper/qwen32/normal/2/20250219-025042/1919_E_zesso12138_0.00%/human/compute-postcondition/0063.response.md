Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `p` is a list of integers of length `n`, `dp` is a list of integers of length `2 * n + 1` where each element reflects the cumulative updates from `new_dp` based on the loop logic, `offset` is `n`, `new_dp` is a list of integers of length `2 * n + 1` where `new_dp[j - 1]` is `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, and all other elements remain unchanged, `i` is 3, `j` is 0. If `dp[j]` is greater than 0, `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. Otherwise, `new_dp` remains unchanged.**
