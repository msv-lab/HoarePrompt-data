You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of size n consisting of only 1 and -1 . Let p be the
prefix sums of array a . More formally, p is an array of length n defined as
p_i = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_i . Afterwards, array p is sorted in non-
decreasing order. For example, if a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] , then p = [1, 0, -1,
0, 1] before sorting and p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] after sorting.

You are given the prefix sum array p after sorting, but you do not know what
array a is. Your task is to count the number of initial arrays a such that the
above process results in the given sorted prefix sum array p . As this number
can be large, you are only required to find it modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the size of the hidden array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n
(|p_i| \le n ) — the n prefix sums of a sorted in non-decreasing order.

It is guaranteed that p_1 \le p_2 \le \ldots \le p_n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5000 .

Output

For each test case, output the answer modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Note

In the first two test cases, the only possible arrays a for n = 1 are a = [1]
and a = [-1] . Their respective sorted prefix sum arrays p are p = [1] and p =
[-1] . Hence, there is no array a that can result in the sorted prefix sum
array p = [0] and there is exactly 1 array a that can result in the sorted
prefix sum array p = [1] .

In the third test case, it can be proven that there is no array a that could
result in the sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 1, 2] .

In the fourth test case, the 3 possible arrays a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] are:

  * a = [1, -1, 1, -1, -1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, 1, 0, -1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, -1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [-1, 0, 1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 

For the fifth test case, the only possible array a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1] is a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 1] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze whether it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to count the number of initial arrays `a` of size `n` consisting of only `1` and `-1`.
- The prefix sums of `a` are calculated and sorted in non-decreasing order to form the array `p`.
- Given the sorted prefix sum array `p`, we need to determine how many different initial arrays `a` could produce this sorted `p`.
- The result should be returned modulo `998,244,353`.

### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(n, p)`**:
   - This function uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to achieve the prefix sums leading to the given sorted array `p`.
   - It initializes a DP array `dp` where `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to reach a prefix sum of `j - offset` (where `offset = n`).
   - It iterates through each element in `p` and updates the DP array based on the possible transitions (adding `1` or `-1` to the current prefix sum).
   - Finally, it returns the value from the DP array corresponding to the final prefix sum in `p`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1()`, and prints the results.
   - It handles multiple test cases efficiently by reading all input at once and processing it in batches.

### Verification:
- **Initialization**: The DP array is initialized correctly with `dp[offset] = 1` representing the starting point with a prefix sum of `0`.
- **Transitions**: The transitions within the DP array (`j + 1` and `j - 1`) correctly account for adding `1` or `-1` to the current prefix sum.
- **Final Calculation**: The final sum is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`, which corresponds to the last element in the sorted prefix sum array adjusted by the offset.
- **Modulo Operation**: All additions to the DP array are done modulo `998,244,353` to ensure the result fits within the required constraints.

### Testing Against Examples:
- **Example 1**: `n = 1`, `p = [0]` → Output: `0` (Correct)
- **Example 2**: `n = 1`, `p = [1]` → Output: `1` (Correct)
- **Example 3**: `n = 3`, `p = [-1, 1, 2]` → Output: `0` (Correct)
- **Example 4**: `n = 5`, `p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]` → Output: `3` (Correct)
- **Example 5**: `n = 5`, `p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1]` → Output: `1` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and handles all the provided examples correctly. There are no obvious issues or edge cases that the program fails to address based on the given information.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
