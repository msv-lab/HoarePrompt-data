Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (at least 1); `p` is a list of integers of length `n`; `dp` is a list of integers of length `2 * n + 1` with at least one element greater than 0; `offset` is `n`; `new_dp` is a list of integers of length `2 * n + 1` where `new_dp[2 * n - 1]` is `(new_dp[2 * n - 1] + dp[2 * n]) % MOD` if `dp[2 * n] > 0`. If `j + 1 <= 2 * n`, then `new_dp[j + 1]` is `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`; `i` is 2; `j` is `2 * n`.**
