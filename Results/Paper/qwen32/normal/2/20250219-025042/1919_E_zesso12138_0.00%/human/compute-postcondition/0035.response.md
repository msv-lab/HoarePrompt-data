Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer representing the size of a hidden array `a`, and `p`, which is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a`, where the absolute value of each element `p_i` in `p` is less than or equal to `n`. The function returns the hidden array `a`.**
