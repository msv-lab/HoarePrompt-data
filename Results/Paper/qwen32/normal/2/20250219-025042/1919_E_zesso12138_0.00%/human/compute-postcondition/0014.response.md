The code snippet assigns a new value to `n` by converting the string at `data[index]` to an integer. Given that `index` is initially set to `2 + n`, this means `n` is being updated to the integer value at `data[2 + n]`.

Since `n` is being reassigned, the new value of `n` will be the integer value of `data[2 + n]`. This change will affect the subsequent use of `n` in the program, particularly in determining the length of the list `p` and the new value of `index`.

The other variables (`p`, `data`, `index`, `t`, `results`, and `result`) remain unchanged unless they are explicitly modified later in the code.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[2]` to `data[n+1]`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the `input` content by whitespace; `index` is `2 + n`; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `results` is a list containing the value of `result`; `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**.
