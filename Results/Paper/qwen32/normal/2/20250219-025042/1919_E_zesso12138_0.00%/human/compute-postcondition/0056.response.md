Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `p` is a list of integers of length `n`, `dp` is a list of integers of length `2 * n + 1` where each element reflects the cumulative updates from `new_dp` based on the loop logic, `offset` is `n`, `new_dp` is a list of integers of length `2 * n + 1` where each element is 0, `i` is 3, `j` is 0, and `dp[j]` is greater than 0**
