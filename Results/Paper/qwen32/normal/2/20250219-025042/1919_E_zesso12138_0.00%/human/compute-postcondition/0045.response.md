The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to the range `2 * n + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `2 * n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `2 * n + 1`. However, since the range function in Python is exclusive of the endpoint, the loop will terminate when `j` reaches `2 * n + 1`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be `2 * n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (at least 1); `p` is a list of integers of length `n`; `dp` is a list of integers of length `2 * n + 1` with at least one element greater than 0; `offset` is `n`; `new_dp` is a list of integers of length `2 * n + 1` where `new_dp[2 * n - 1]` is `(new_dp[2 * n - 1] + dp[2 * n]) % MOD` if `dp[2 * n] > 0`, and all other elements remain unchanged; `i` is 2; `j` is `2 * n`**
