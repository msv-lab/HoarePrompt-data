In this task, the loop iterates over each element in the `results` list and assigns each element to the variable `res`. The state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `t` has been incremented by 1, and `res` holds the value of `results[t-1]`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop's behavior. Since the loop iterates over `results`, the next value of `res` will be the next element in the list.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `t` has been incremented by 1, meaning `t` now points to the next index in the `results` list.
2. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to continue, there must be another element in the `results` list to assign to `res`.
3. **Adjustments**: The variable `res` will hold the value of `results[t]` in the next iteration since `t` has already been incremented.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `res` will take the value of `results[t]`.

State: **`t` is incremented by 1, `res` is the value of `results[t]`**
