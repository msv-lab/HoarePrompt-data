Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is an integer read from input representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(numCases):
    numInteger = int(input())
    numbers = input().split()
    numbers.sort(reverse=False)
    suma = 0
    while numbers != []:
        a = int(numbers.pop(0))
        b = int(numbers.pop(0))
        suma += min(a, b)
    print(suma)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is an integer read from input representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is the integer value of the first element of the last pair processed, `numInteger` is an integer read from input, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of numbers processed in the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, numCases is an integer read from input representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, a is the integer value of the last element processed (if any), numInteger is an integer read from input, numbers is [], suma is the sum of the minimum values from each pair of numbers originally in the list, i is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is an integer read from input representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is the integer value of the last element processed if `n` is odd, otherwise the second-to-last element processed, `numInteger` is an integer read from input, `numbers` is an empty list if `n` is even, or a list with one element if `n` is odd, `suma` is the accumulated sum of the minimums of each pair of elements processed, `i` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
