The code sorts the list `numbers` in ascending order. The values of `t`, `numCases`, `n`, `a`, and `numInteger` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is an integer read from input representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, `numInteger` is an integer read from input, `numbers` is a list of strings sorted in ascending order.**
