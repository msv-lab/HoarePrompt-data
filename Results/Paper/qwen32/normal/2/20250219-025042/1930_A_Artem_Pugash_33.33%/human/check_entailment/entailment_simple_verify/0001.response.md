### Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to ensure the correctness of the provided solution.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`numCases`) and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs (`numInteger`) and then reads the `2n` integers.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The list of integers is sorted in ascending order using `numbers.sort(reverse=False)`. This is correct as sorting the numbers in non-decreasing order helps in maximizing the sum of the minimum values of each pair.

3. **Pairing and Summing:**
   - The program uses a while loop to repeatedly pop the first two elements from the sorted list, calculates their minimum, adds this value to the score (`suma`), and continues until the list is empty.
   - This approach ensures that the smallest available numbers are paired together, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the score.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the computed score for each test case.

### Annotations Analysis:
- The annotations describe the state of the program at key points, confirming that the list is sorted and that pairs are formed by popping the first two elements in each iteration.
- The annotations also confirm that the loop continues until the list is empty, and the score is correctly accumulated by adding the minimum of each pair.

### Validation Against Problem Description:
- The problem requires selecting pairs of integers and adding the minimum of each pair to the score.
- The optimal strategy is to sort the numbers and pair the smallest numbers together.
- The program correctly implements this strategy.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal solution to the problem. The annotations support the correctness of the program's behavior, and there are no issues identified in the logic or implementation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
