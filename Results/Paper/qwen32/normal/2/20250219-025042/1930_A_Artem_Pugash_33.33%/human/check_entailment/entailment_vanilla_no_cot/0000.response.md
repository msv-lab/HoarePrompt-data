Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the final score by always choosing the smallest available pair of numbers from the list. Here's a breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and then reads the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Sorting**: The list of integers is sorted in ascending order. This ensures that when we pick pairs, we are always picking the smallest possible values first, which maximizes the sum of the minimums.

3. **Pairing and Summing**: The program then enters a loop where it repeatedly removes the first two elements from the sorted list (which are the smallest available), calculates their minimum, adds this minimum to the score, and continues until all numbers have been paired and removed.

4. **Output**: After processing all pairs for a given test case, the program prints the accumulated score.

This approach is optimal because sorting the list ensures that the smallest numbers are always paired together, maximizing the contribution to the score from each pair. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
