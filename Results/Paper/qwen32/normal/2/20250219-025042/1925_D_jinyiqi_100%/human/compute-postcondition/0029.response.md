The given code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `f`. This means that the values of `a`, `b`, and `f` will be updated based on the new input, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the values of `a`, `b`, and `f` will be replaced with the new input values. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, `j`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, and `gcd` remain the same because they are not modified by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the new input, `sum_f` is `f`, `j` is `m`, `a` is the first integer from the last input, `b` is the second integer from the last input, `f` is the third integer from the last input, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`. After executing the code, `a`, `b`, and `f` are updated to the new input values.**
