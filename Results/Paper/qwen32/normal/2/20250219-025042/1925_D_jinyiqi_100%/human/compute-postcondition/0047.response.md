The given Python code snippet increments the variable `sum_f` by the value of `f`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the new input, `sum_f` is `sum_f + f`, `j` is 0, `a`, `b`, `f` are the values from the last iteration updated to the new input values, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` divided by `gcd(p, q)`, `q` is `n * (n - 1) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`**.

In simpler terms, `sum_f` has been updated to its previous value plus `f`. All other variables retain their original values.
