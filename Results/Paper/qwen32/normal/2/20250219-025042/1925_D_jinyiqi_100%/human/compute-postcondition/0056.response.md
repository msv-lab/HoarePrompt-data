The given code snippet updates the value of `p`. Here's the updated state:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `k` is the third integer from the new input, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read during the loop, `j` is `m-1`, `a`, `b`, `f` are the values from the last iteration, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, `q` is `n * (n - 1) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**

In natural language, the value of `p` is now calculated as `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
