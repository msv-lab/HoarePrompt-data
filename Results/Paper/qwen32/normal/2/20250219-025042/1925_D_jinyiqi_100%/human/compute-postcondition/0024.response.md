The given code snippet resets the value of `sum_f` to 0. No other variables are modified. Therefore, the output state reflects this change while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `k` is the third integer from the new input, `sum_f` is 0, `j` is `m - 1`, `a` is the first integer from the last input, `b` is the second integer from the last input, `f` is the third integer from the last input, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`**.
