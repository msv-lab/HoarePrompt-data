The only variable in the loop head is `j` and `m`. Since the loop iterates over `range(m)`, `j` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4,
- `i` is 1,
- `n` is the first integer from the new input,
- `m` must be greater than 0,
- `k` is the third integer from the new input,
- `sum_f` is `sum_f + f`,
- `j` is `m`,
- `a` is the first integer from the last input,
- `b` is the second integer from the last input,
- `f` is the third integer from the last input,
- `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`,
- `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`,
- `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`,
- `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.

At the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1. Since `j` is currently `m`, for the loop to continue, `j` should be `m + 1` and `m` remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the new input, `sum_f` is `sum_f + f`, `j` is `m + 1`, `a` is the first integer from the last input, `b` is the second integer from the last input, `f` is the third integer from the last input, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`**
