Output State: **`a` is an integer; `b` is the integer value provided by the user input; `t` is the integer value provided by the user input divided by 2 (integer division) if `t` is even, otherwise `t` is the integer value provided by the user input divided by 2 plus 1; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`; `a`, `b`, and `t1` are recalculated; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `t1` is updated to be `t * 15 - b * 4`. All other variables (`a`, `b`, `t`, `i`, `n`) retain their previous values or conditions.
