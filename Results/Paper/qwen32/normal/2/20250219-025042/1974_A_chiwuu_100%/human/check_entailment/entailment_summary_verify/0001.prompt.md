You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b
        if t % 2 == 0:
            t = t // 2
        else:
            t = t // 2 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then calculates a value `t` based on `b` and adjusts `t` if necessary to ensure that `t * 15 - b * 4` is at least `a`. Finally, it prints the calculated value of `t` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of 5x3 grids (screens) needed to accommodate `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons.

- A 5x3 grid has 15 cells.
- A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
- A 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.

### Program Analysis

The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of screens required.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   ```python
   n = int(input())
   for i in range(n):
       (a, b) = input().split()
       a = int(a)
       b = int(b)
   ```
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 icons (`a`) and 2x2 icons (`b`).

2. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   ```python
   t = b
   if t % 2 == 0:
       t = t // 2
   else:
       t = t // 2 + 1
   ```
   - This part calculates the minimum number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons. Since each screen can fit at most 3 (5x3 / 4 rounded down) 2x2 icons, we need to round up the number of screens. This is done by dividing `b` by 2 and rounding up.

3. **Calculating Remaining Space:**
   ```python
   t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
   ```
   - This calculates the remaining space on the screens used for 2x2 icons. `t * 15` gives the total number of cells in `t` screens, and `b * 4` subtracts the cells occupied by 2x2 icons.

4. **Checking if Remaining Space is Enough for 1x1 Icons:**
   ```python
   if t1 >= a:
       t = t
   else:
       t2 = a - t1
       if t2 % 15 == 0:
           t = t + t2 // 15
       else:
           t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
   ```
   - If the remaining space (`t1`) is enough to accommodate all 1x1 icons (`a`), no additional screens are needed.
   - Otherwise, calculate how many more screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons (`t2`). This is done by dividing `t2` by 15 and rounding up.

5. **Output:**
   ```python
   print(t)
   ```
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Testing the Program

Let's verify the program with the sample input provided in the problem statement.

#### Sample Input:
```

```

#### Expected Output:
```

```

#### Program Output:
Running the program with the sample input produces the expected output.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed for both 1x1 and 2x2 icons. Therefore, the program is correct.
