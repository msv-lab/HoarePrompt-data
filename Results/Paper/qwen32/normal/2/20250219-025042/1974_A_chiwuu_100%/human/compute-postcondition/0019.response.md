To determine the new value of `t` after the given code executes, we start with the initial state and apply the transformation step by step.

Given:
- `t` is an integer.
- `a` is an integer.
- `b` is an integer.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- If `b` is even, then `t` is set to `b // 2`. Otherwise, `t` is set to `b // 2 + 1`.
- `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4` and is less than `a`.
- `t2` is `a - t1`.
- `t2` is not divisible by 15.

The code to execute:
```python
t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
```

Let's break down the changes:
- `t2 // 15` computes the integer division of `t2` by 15.
- Adding 1 to the result of `t2 // 15` and then adding it to `t` updates the value of `t`.

Since `t2` is not divisible by 15, `t2 // 15` will be an integer that represents the largest whole number less than `t2 / 15`.

Thus, the new value of `t` will be `t + (t2 // 15) + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is updated to `t + (t2 // 15) + 1`; `a` is an integer; `b` is an integer; `n` is greater than 0; If `b` is even, then the original `t` was `b // 2`. Otherwise, the original `t` was `b // 2 + 1`; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4` and is less than `a`; `t2` is `a - t1` and is not divisible by 15.**
