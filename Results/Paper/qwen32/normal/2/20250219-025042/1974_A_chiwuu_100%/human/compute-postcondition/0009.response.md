`t` is initially an integer equal to `b` and is not divisible by 2. After executing the code `t = t // 2 + 1`, the new value of `t` is calculated as `b // 2 + 1`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `b // 2 + 1`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `n` is greater than 0**.
