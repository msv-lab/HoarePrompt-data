Postcondition: **`a` is an integer; `b` is the integer value provided by the user input; `t` is updated based on the condition `t1 >= a`. If `t1 >= a`, then `a`, `b`, and `t1` are recalculated; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. If `t1 < a`, then `t` is updated based on whether `t2 % 15 == 0` or not, where if true, `t` is incremented by `(a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15`, and if false, `t` is incremented by `(a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15 + 1`; `t1` is recalculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`; `t2` is recalculated as `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.**
