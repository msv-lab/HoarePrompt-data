To determine the new state after the given code executes, let's analyze the changes:

The code modifies the variable `t` using the expression `t = t + t2 // 15 + 1`. Here, `t2` is defined as `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`. 

Let's break down the new value of `t`:

1. Calculate `t2 // 15`: This is the integer division of `t2` by 15.
2. Add 1 to the result from step 1.
3. Add the result from step 2 to the original value of `t`.

Given the initial state, the new value of `t` will be:
`t = t + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15 + 1`

The other variables (`a`, `b`, `t1`, `t2`, `i`, `n`) remain unchanged except for `t`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer; `b` is the integer value provided by the user input; `t` is `t + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15 + 1`; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`; `t2` is `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.**
