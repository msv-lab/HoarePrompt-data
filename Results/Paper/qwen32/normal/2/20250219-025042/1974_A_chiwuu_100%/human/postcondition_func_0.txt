The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then calculates a value `t` based on `b` and adjusts `t` if necessary to ensure that `t * 15 - b * 4` is at least `a`. Finally, it prints the calculated value of `t` for each test case.
