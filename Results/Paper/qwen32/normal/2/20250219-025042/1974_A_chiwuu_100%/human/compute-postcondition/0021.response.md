Postcondition: **`t` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and `n` is greater than 0. If `b` is even, `t` is initially set to `b // 2`; otherwise, `t` is initially set to `b // 2 + 1`. `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, no further changes are made to `t`. If `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is `a - t1`. If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + (t2 // 15) + 1`.**
