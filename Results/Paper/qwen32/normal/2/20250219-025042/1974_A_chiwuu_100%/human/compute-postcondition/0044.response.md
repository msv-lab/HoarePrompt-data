The code snippet provided modifies the value of `t` by performing an integer division by 2. This means `t` will now hold half of its original value, rounded down to the nearest whole number.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `t`. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `t1`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an integer; `b` is the integer value provided by the user input; `t` is the integer value provided by the user input divided by 2 (integer division); `t1` is updated based on the condition `t1 >= a`; `a`, `b`, and `t1` are recalculated; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.**
