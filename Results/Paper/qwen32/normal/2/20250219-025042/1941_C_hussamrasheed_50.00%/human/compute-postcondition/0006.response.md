The code snippet `p = s.count('pie')` counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. The variable `p` is newly introduced and holds the count of 'pie' in `s`.

Given that `s` is the input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, the value of `p` will be the number of times 'pie' appears in this modified string.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is the new input string of lowercase Latin letters with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`.**
