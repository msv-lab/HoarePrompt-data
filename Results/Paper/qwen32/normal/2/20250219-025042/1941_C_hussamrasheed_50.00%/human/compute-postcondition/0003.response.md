The code snippet `s = input()` assigns a new value to the variable `s` by taking an input from the user. The initial state specifies that `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. After executing the code, the value of `s` changes to whatever the user inputs, which is also a string of lowercase Latin letters. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is the new input string of lowercase Latin letters.**
