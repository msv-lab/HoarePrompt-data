Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. The program counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string `s` and sums these counts to determine the number of deletions required. However, this approach is flawed because it does not account for overlapping substrings or the fact that deleting characters to remove one occurrence of "map" or "pie" might affect other occurrences.

2. For example, consider the string "mappie". The program would count one "map" and one "pie", suggesting that two deletions are needed. However, only one deletion (removing the 'a' in "mappie") is sufficient to make the string beautiful.

3. A correct solution would require a more sophisticated approach, such as dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm that carefully considers which characters to delete to minimize the total number of deletions while ensuring that no "map" or "pie" substrings remain.

Here's a brief outline of a correct approach:

- Use dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum deletions required up to each position in the string.
- For each position, consider whether the current character should be part of a "map" or "pie" substring and update the minimum deletions accordingly.
- This approach ensures that overlapping substrings are handled correctly and the minimum number of deletions is found.

Given the complexity of the problem, the provided program is insufficient and therefore incorrect.
