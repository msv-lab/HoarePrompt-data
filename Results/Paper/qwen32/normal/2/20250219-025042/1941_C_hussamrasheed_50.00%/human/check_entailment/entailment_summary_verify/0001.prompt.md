You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        m = s.count('map')
        s = s.replace('map', '')
        p = s.count('pie')
        print(m + p)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. It then counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in `s`, removes all occurrences of 'map' from `s`, and counts the occurrences of 'pie' again in the modified string. Finally, it prints the sum of the initial count of 'map' and the count of 'pie' after removing 'map'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis:
- We need to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string `s` to ensure that it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".
- For each test case, we are given a string `s` of length `n`.
- The program should output the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.

2. **Counting Substrings:**
   - The program counts the occurrences of the substring "map" using `s.count('map')` and stores this count in `m`.
   - It then removes all occurrences of "map" from the string using `s.replace('map', '')`.

3. **Counting Remaining Substrings:**
   - After removing "map", the program counts the occurrences of the substring "pie" in the modified string `s` using `s.count('pie')` and stores this count in `p`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the sum of `m` and `p`, which represents the total number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie".

### Issues with the Program:
- **Incorrect Deletion Counting:** 
  - The program assumes that removing "map" does not affect the count of "pie". However, this is not true because removing "map" might create new occurrences of "pie" that were not present before.
  - For example, consider the string "mapie". Removing "map" results in "ie", but initially, there was no "pie" in the string. Therefore, simply counting and removing "map" followed by counting "pie" is incorrect.
- **Overcounting Deletions:**
  - The program does not account for overlapping substrings or the fact that removing one character might resolve multiple occurrences of "map" or "pie".

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we would need to use a more sophisticated approach, such as dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm, to ensure that we are minimizing the number of deletions while avoiding the creation of new unwanted substrings.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
