The code snippet `s = s.replace('map', '')` removes all occurrences of the substring 'map' from the string `s`. This operation affects the string `s` directly and does not change the counts of 'map' and 'pie' unless 'map' was present in `s`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the new input integer
- `s` is the new input string
- `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in `s`
- `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`
- `i` is i + 1

After executing the code snippet, the string `s` will no longer contain any occurrences of 'map'. However, the counts `m` and `p` remain unchanged because they were calculated before the replacement.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is the new input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the original `s`, `i` is i + 1**.
