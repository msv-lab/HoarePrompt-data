To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each pair of integers `(n, k)` and what it prints based on the condition provided.

The loop reads `t` pairs of integers `(n, k)`. For each pair, it checks if `n - k <= 1`. If this condition is true, it prints `n`; otherwise, it prints `1`.

Let's break down the loop's behavior with respect to the given constraints and the output states after the first three iterations:

1. **First Iteration**: The loop reads the first pair `(n1, k1)`. It prints `n1` if `n1 - k1 <= 1`, otherwise it prints `1`.
2. **Second Iteration**: The loop reads the second pair `(n2, k2)`. It prints `n2` if `n2 - k2 <= 1`, otherwise it prints `1`.
3. **Third Iteration**: The loop reads the third pair `(n3, k3)`. It prints `n3` if `n3 - k3 <= 1`, otherwise it prints `1`.

After all `t` iterations, the loop will have processed all `t` pairs of integers `(n, k)` and printed the corresponding outputs based on the condition.

The output state after all iterations is simply the sequence of printed values for each pair `(n, k)`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact values of `n` and `k` for each iteration, we can only describe the final output state in terms of the printed values based on the condition `n - k <= 1`.

Therefore, the final output state is a series of printed values where each value is either `n` or `1` depending on whether `n - k <= 1` for each respective pair `(n, k)`.

Output State: **A series of printed values where each value is either `n` or `1` based on the condition `n - k <= 1` for each respective pair `(n, k)` read from the input.**

In simpler terms, the final output state consists of `t` printed numbers, each being either `n` or `1` depending on the condition for each pair of inputs.
