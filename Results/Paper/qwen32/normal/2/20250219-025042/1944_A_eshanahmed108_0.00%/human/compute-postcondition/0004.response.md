The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, but since `t` is not used in the given code snippet, its value remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.**

In natural language: The value of `t` remains the same, while `n` and `k` are now assigned the integer values read from the input.
