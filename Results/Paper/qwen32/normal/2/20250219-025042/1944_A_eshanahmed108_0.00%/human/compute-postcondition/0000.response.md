In the given task, the for loop iterates based on the value obtained from `int(input())`. This means the number of iterations is determined by the value of `t`, which is already described as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable that doesn't affect the loop's execution directly; it just serves to iterate a specific number of times.

Since the loop will execute based on the value of `t`, and `t` is already defined and within the valid range, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute. The state of `t` ensures that the loop will run at least once and up to 1000 times, depending on its value.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts is already sufficient for the loop to execute. Here is the final state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³**
