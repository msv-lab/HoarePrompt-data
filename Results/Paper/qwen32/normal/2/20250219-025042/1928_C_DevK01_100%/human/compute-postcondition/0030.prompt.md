Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `q` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (n, x) representing Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling, respectively, with the constraints 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9. The length of `q` is between 1 and 100, inclusive. If `w` equals its integer division by 1 and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` is a list containing one element, `w`. Otherwise, `M` remains an empty list. `i` is 1.
Code of the loop:
while i < w:
    if q % i == 0:
        if i >= x - 1:
            M += [i]
        if q // i >= x - 1:
            M += [q // i]
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `q` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (n, x); `w` is greater than 1; `i` is 2. If the length of `q` modulo `i` equals 0 and `q[0][0] // i >= q[0][1] - 1`, then `M` includes the additional element `q[0][0] // i`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `M`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `q` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (n, x); `w` is greater than 2; `i` is 3. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` has had `2` appended to it. Additionally, if `q // i >= x - 1`, `M` has an additional element which is the integer division of the first element of the first tuple in `q` by 2. If the condition `q % i == 0` is not met, `M` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `q` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (n, x); `w` is greater than 3; `i` is 4. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` for any tuple `(n, x)` in `q`, `M` includes the values of `x // i` for those tuples. Otherwise, `M` is not updated with any new values from `q`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
