To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop condition `i < w`. The current state provided is:

- `q` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (n, x).
- `w` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.

The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < w`. Since `i` is currently 2, `w` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute one more time. The values of `q` and the conditions related to `M` do not affect the continuation of the loop according to the given loop statement.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `w`.

State: **`q` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (n, x); `w` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2.**
