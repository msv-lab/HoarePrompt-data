The provided code attempts to compute the square root of the list `q` using `math.sqrt(q)`. However, the `math.sqrt()` function expects a single numeric argument, not a list of tuples. This will result in a TypeError.

Given the nature of the error, the variable `w` will not be assigned a value because the operation fails. The lists `q` and `M` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (n, x) representing Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling, respectively, with the constraints 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9. The length of `q` is between 1 and 100, inclusive; `M` is an empty list. The operation `w = math.sqrt(q)` results in a TypeError, and `w` is not assigned a value.**
