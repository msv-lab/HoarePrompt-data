Postcondition: **`q` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (n, x) representing Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling, respectively, with the constraints 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9. The length of `q` is between 1 and 100, inclusive; `M` is an empty list. The operation `w = math.sqrt(q)` results in a TypeError, and `w` is not assigned a value. Additionally, `w` is equal to its integer division by 1 (`w == w // 1`) and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**
