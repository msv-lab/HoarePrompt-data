To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the condition `i < w`. Given the initial state:

- `q` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `(n, x)`.
- `w` is defined based on some conditions involving integer division and the values in `q`.
- `i` is initialized to 1.

The loop condition `i < w` means that for the loop to execute at least once, `i` (which is 1) must be less than `w`.

Let's break down the possible scenarios for `w`:

1. If `w` is calculated such that `w` is an integer and `w >= x - 1`, then `M` is a list containing one element `w`.
2. Otherwise, `M` remains an empty list.

However, the specific calculation of `w` isn't provided in the problem statement, but we know that `w` must be an integer and that it should satisfy the condition `i < w` for the loop to run.

Since `i` is 1, `w` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that whatever calculation determines `w` results in a value greater than 1.

Given the information, we can infer that `w` should be set to a value greater than 1 to allow the loop to execute. Since the exact calculation of `w` isn't specified, we can assume that `w` can be any integer greater than 1.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted such that `w` is greater than 1.

State: **`q` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (n, x) representing Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling, respectively, with the constraints 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9. The length of `q` is between 1 and 100, inclusive. `w` is greater than 1. `i` is 1.**
