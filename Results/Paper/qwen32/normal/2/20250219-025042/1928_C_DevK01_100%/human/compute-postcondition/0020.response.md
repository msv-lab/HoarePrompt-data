Postcondition: **`q` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (n, x); `w` is greater than 2; `i` is 2. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` has had `2` appended to it. Additionally, if `q // i >= x - 1`, `M` has an additional element which is the integer division of the first element of the first tuple in `q` by 2.`**
