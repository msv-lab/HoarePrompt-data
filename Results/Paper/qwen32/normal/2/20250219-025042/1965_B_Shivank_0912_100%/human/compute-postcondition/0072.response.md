Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet provided:

### Initial State:
- We have a list that includes the following elements:
  - `k - (1 << i)`
  - `k + 1`
  - `k + 1 + (1 << i)`
  - The numbers `1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072`
- The list excludes \(2^i\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(len(ans))
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `ans` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, based on the context, it seems like `ans` should be the list described in the initial state.
- The list contains:
  - Three specific elements: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`
  - A series of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{17}\)
  - The list excludes \(2^i\)

### Counting the Elements:
- The series of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{17}\) includes 18 elements.
- Since \(2^i\) is excluded, there are \(18 - 1 = 17\) elements from this series.
- Adding the three specific elements (`k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`), the total number of elements in the list is \(17 + 3 = 20\).

### Conclusion:
The length of the list `ans` is 20.

### Final Output:
Output: **20**
