Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. We need to find a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
2. There must be no subsequence of `a` that sums to `k`.
3. For every `v` (where `1 ≤ v ≤ n` and `v ≠ k`), there must be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

### Analysis of the Program:

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Finding the Largest Power of 2 Less Than or Equal to `k`:**
   - The variable `i` is used to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. This is done using a loop that increments `i` until `1 << (i + 1)` (which is `2^(i+1)`) exceeds `k`.

3. **Constructing the Sequence `ans`:**
   - The initial sequence `ans` is constructed with three elements:
     - `k - (1 << i)`: This ensures that no subsequence can sum exactly to `k` because this value is specifically crafted to avoid it.
     - `k + 1`: This value is added to ensure that sums greater than `k` can be formed.
     - `k + 1 + (1 << i)`: Another value to help form various sums.
   - The program then appends powers of 2 (`1 << j` where `j` ranges from 0 to 19) to `ans`, except for the power of 2 that corresponds to `i` (to avoid forming `k`).

4. **Output:**
   - The length of the sequence `ans` is printed.
   - The sequence `ans` itself is printed.

#### Checking the Conditions:
- **Condition 1:** No subsequence of `ans` should sum to `k`.
  - The construction of `ans` avoids including `k` directly or indirectly by excluding the specific power of 2 that would allow forming `k`.
- **Condition 2:** For every `v` (where `1 ≤ v ≤ n` and `v ≠ k`), there should be a subsequence of `ans` that sums to `v`.
  - By including powers of 2 up to `2^19`, the sequence can form any sum that is a combination of these powers, which covers a wide range of values. The specific exclusions and additions ensure that all necessary sums can be formed except for `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly construct a sequence `a` that satisfies both conditions for each test case. It uses a combination of carefully chosen values and powers of 2 to ensure the required properties.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
