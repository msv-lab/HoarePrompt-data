Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an integer; `k` is unchanged; `i` is \(\lfloor \log_2(k) \rfloor\); `ans` is \([k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]\) if `j` equals `i`, otherwise `ans` is \([k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j]\); `j` is `x + 1`. Specifically, if `j` is not equal to `i`, `ans` includes an additional element `1 << j` and `1 << (x + 1)`**
