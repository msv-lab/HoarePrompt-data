To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop statement: `1 << i + 1 <= k`.

Let's break down the current state and the condition:

- Current state:
  - `n` is an input integer (we don't need to adjust this as it's not part of the loop condition).
  - `k` must be at least 4 (this is already given and doesn't need further adjustment for the loop condition).
  - The list `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding \(2^i\) remains unchanged (irrelevant to the loop condition).
  - `tc` is 1 (irrelevant to the loop condition).
  - `i` is 2.

- Loop condition: `1 << i + 1 <= k`

Given `i` is 2, let's calculate `1 << i + 1`:
\[ 1 << 2 + 1 = 1 << 3 = 8 \]

So the condition becomes:
\[ 8 \leq k \]

Since `k` must be at least 4, we need to ensure that `k` is at least 8 for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, `k` should be adjusted to be at least 8.

No other variables in the loop condition (`i`) need to be adjusted because the problem specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, and the loop head only involves `k` and the calculation `1 << i + 1`.

Thus, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 8, the list `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding \(2^i\) remains unchanged, `tc` is 1, `i` is 2`**
