The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state only specifies that `t` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). After executing the code, `n` and `k` will hold the values read from the input, while `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` and `k` are the two integers read from the input.**
