To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes the grid and modifies the variables based on the content of each row (`s`).

The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is the size of the grid (both width and height). During each iteration, it reads a new row of the grid into `s` and checks the number of '1's in `s`:
- If `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE'.
- If `s` contains more than one '1', `b` is set to 'SQUARE'.

However, since the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's and the size of the shape is greater than 1, it means there will be multiple rows with more than one '1' if it's a square, or multiple rows with exactly one '1' if it's a triangle. But crucially, once `a` or `b` is set, it remains set unless overwritten. Since the grid has only one such shape, `a` or `b` will be set to 'TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE' respectively and will not change after that.

Since the loop runs `n` times, the variable `j` will take on values from 0 to `n-1`. After the loop finishes, `j` will be equal to `n`.

Let's summarize the final state:
- `t`, `i`, `n`, the grid, and `s` remain unchanged as per the problem statement.
- `a` will be 'TRIANGLE' if the grid contains exactly one triangle, otherwise it will be 'SQUARE'.
- `b` will be 'SQUARE' if the grid contains exactly one square, otherwise it will be 'TRIANGLE'.
- `j` will be `n` after the loop completes.

However, given the constraints, only one of `a` or `b` will be set correctly ('TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE'), and the other will remain an empty string.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive; `i` is 1; `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10; the grid is an n x n list of strings where each string consists of n characters, each character being either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1; `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if the grid contains exactly one triangle, otherwise `a` is 0; `b` is 'SQUARE' if the grid contains exactly one square, otherwise `b` is ''; `j` is `n`; `s` is the last input string.**
