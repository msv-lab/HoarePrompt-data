To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to consider how the loop processes each line of the grid and updates the variables `a` and `b`.

Here's the loop code again for reference:
```python
for j in range(n):
    s = input()
    if s.count('1') == 1:
        a = 'TRIANGLE'
    elif s.count('1') > 1:
        b = 'SQUARE'
```

- The loop runs `n` times, where `n` is the size of the grid.
- For each iteration, it reads a string `s` from the input.
- It checks the number of '1's in `s`:
  - If there is exactly one '1', it sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE'.
  - If there is more than one '1', it sets `b` to 'SQUARE'.

Since the problem states that the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1, we can infer the following:
- If there is exactly one '1' in any row, it means the shape is a triangle (since a square would have more than one '1' in at least one row).
- If there are multiple '1's in any row, it means the shape is a square (since a triangle would have no more than one '1' per row).

However, since the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square, and given the constraints, the following scenarios can occur:
- If the shape is a triangle, there will be exactly one '1' in each row that forms the triangle, and `a` will be set to 'TRIANGLE' for each of those rows.
- If the shape is a square, there will be multiple '1's in each row that forms the square, and `b` will be set to 'SQUARE' for each of those rows.

Since the loop runs `n` times and updates `a` or `b` based on the count of '1's in each row, the final values of `a` and `b` will depend on the shape:
- If the shape is a triangle, `a` will be 'TRIANGLE' after the loop completes.
- If the shape is a square, `b` will be 'SQUARE' after the loop completes.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the final output state will be:
- `a` will be 'TRIANGLE' if the grid contains a triangle.
- `b` will be 'SQUARE' if the grid contains a square.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive; `i` is 2; `n` is the new input integer between 2 and 10; the grid is a new `n x n` list of strings where each string consists of `n` characters, each character being either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1; `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if the grid contains a triangle, otherwise `a` is 0; `b` is 'SQUARE' if the grid contains a square, otherwise `b` is ''; `j` is `n-1`; `s` is the last input string.**
