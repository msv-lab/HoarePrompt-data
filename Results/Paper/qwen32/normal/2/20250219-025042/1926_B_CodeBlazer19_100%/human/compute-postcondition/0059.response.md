Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet:

- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10.
- `grid` is an `n x n` list of strings, where each string consists of `n` characters, each character being either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.
- `a` is set to the string 'TRIANGLE', indicating that the grid contains exactly one triangle.
- `b` is an empty string.
- `j` is set to `n`.
- `s` is the last input string.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(a)
```

Given that `a` is explicitly set to the string 'TRIANGLE', the `print(a)` statement will output this exact string.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **TRIANGLE**
