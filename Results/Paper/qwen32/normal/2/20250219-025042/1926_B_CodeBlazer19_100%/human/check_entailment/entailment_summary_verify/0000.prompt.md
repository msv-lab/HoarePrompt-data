You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an `n x n` grid of strings consisting of '0's and '1's. It then determines whether the '1's in the grid form exactly one triangle or exactly one square, with the size of the shape being greater than 1, and prints the type of shape ('TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE') for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a square or a triangle. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Triangle Cases**: The program only checks if a row contains exactly one '1' to determine if the shape is a triangle. However, a triangle can have multiple '1's in a row, especially in the middle rows. For example, a triangle with `k=3` would look like this:
   ```
   00100
   01110
   11111
   ```
   In this case, the second row has three '1's, and the third row has five '1's. The program would incorrectly identify this as a square because it sees more than one '1' in these rows.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Square Cases**: Similarly, the program only checks if a row contains more than one '1' to determine if the shape is a square. However, this check is not sufficient. For example, consider a triangle with `k=4`:
   ```
   0001000
   0011100
   0111110
   1111111
   ```
   Here, the first row has one '1', the second row has three '1's, and so on. The program would incorrectly identify this as a square because it sees more than one '1' in the second and subsequent rows.

3. **No Proper Logic for Shape Detection**: The program lacks any logic to properly detect the specific patterns of '1's that define a triangle or a square. It simply checks the number of '1's in each row and makes a decision based on that, which is insufficient for the problem's requirements.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to implement logic that checks for the specific patterns of '1's that define a triangle or a square, considering the constraints and definitions provided in the problem description.
