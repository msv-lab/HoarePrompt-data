The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive; `i` is 1; `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10; the grid is an n x n list of strings where each string consists of n characters, each character being either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1; `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if `s` contains exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0; `b` is 'SQUARE' if `s` contains more than one '1', otherwise `b` is ''; `j` is 2; `s` is the new input string.**
