Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10.
- `grid` is an n x n list of strings where each string consists of n characters, each character being either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.
- `a` is initialized to 0 (since `a` is not 'TRIANGLE').
- `b` is set to the string 'SQUARE'.
- `j` is initialized to `n - 1`.
- `s` is the last input string.

The Python code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(b)
```

From the initial state, we know that the variable `b` is explicitly set to the string 'SQUARE'. Therefore, the `print(b)` statement will output the value of `b`.

Output: **SQUARE**
