Let's break down the calculation:

- The dictionary `freq` contains two key-value pairs: `{1: 2, 5: 1}`.
- The code calculates the sum of each value in `freq` divided by 4 (integer division).
- For the first value `2` (which corresponds to key `1`), `2 // 4` equals `0`.
- For the second value `1` (which corresponds to key `5`), `1 // 4` also equals `0`.
- Summing these results (`0 + 0`) gives `0`.

Output State: **The program returns 0**.
