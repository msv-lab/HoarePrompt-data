Reasoning:  
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` calculates the maximum number of squares (specifically, polygons with 4 sides) that can be formed using the sticks, rather than the maximum number of any regular polygons. This is because it divides the frequency of each stick length by 4 and sums these values, which only accounts for forming squares.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should consider all possible regular polygons (triangles, squares, pentagons, etc.) and determine the maximum number of such polygons that can be formed. The current implementation fails to do this and instead focuses solely on squares, leading to incorrect results for test cases where other polygons could be formed.

Given the execution summary, the function does not behave as expected for the provided examples, especially the last two test cases where it should return 1 and 2 respectively but instead returns 0.

Correctness: **False**
