The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a new list named `arr`. This means that `arr` will now contain the integers from the input.

Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `m` remain unchanged because they are not modified by the provided code snippet. Only the new list `arr` is introduced and populated.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
