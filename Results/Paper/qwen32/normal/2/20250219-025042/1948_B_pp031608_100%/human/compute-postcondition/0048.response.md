The given code snippet assigns the first element of the list `nums` to `arr[i - 1]`. Since `nums` contains the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`, the first element of `nums` is the first digit of `arr[i-1]`.

Given the initial state, `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `nums[0]`. No other variables are modified by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer and `n-1` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input with `arr[i - 1]` now being `nums[0]`, `i` is `n-2`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
