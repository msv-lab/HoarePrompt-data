Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `ans` is True, and the current element `arr[i]` is less than the previous element `arr[i - 1]`.**
