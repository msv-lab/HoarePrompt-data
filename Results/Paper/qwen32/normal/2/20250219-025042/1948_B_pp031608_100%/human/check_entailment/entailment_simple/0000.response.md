### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided code to see if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It initializes a boolean variable `ans` to `True`. This variable will be used to track whether the array can be sorted using the allowed operations.
   - It iterates over the array from the end to the beginning (from index `m-1` to `1`).

3. **Checking Sorted Order:**
   - If an element `arr[i]` is found to be less than its previous element `arr[i-1]`, it means the array is not currently sorted at this point.
   - The code then attempts to resolve this by "splitting" `arr[i-1]` into its constituent digits and inserting `arr[i]` immediately after these digits.
   - It checks if the resulting sequence (`nums`) is sorted. If not, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the sequence is sorted, it updates `arr[i-1]` to the first digit of the split number.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing the entire array, the code prints 'YES' if `ans` is still `True`, indicating that the array can be sorted using the allowed operations. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Issues with the Code:

The main issue with the code lies in how it handles the transformation and checking of the array. Specifically:

- **Incorrect Transformation Handling:** The code only considers splitting the larger number and inserting the smaller number immediately after the digits of the larger number. However, the problem allows for multiple splits and rearrangements. The code does not account for the possibility of further splits or rearrangements that might lead to a sorted array.
  
- **Insufficient Checking:** The code only checks if the immediate sequence after a split is sorted, but it does not consider the global effect of the split on the rest of the array. For example, splitting a number might affect the order of elements further down the array.

### Conclusion:

Given these issues, the code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
