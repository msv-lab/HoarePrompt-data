Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `i` is `i + 1` where `i` is the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration (and `1 <= i < m-1`), `nums` is a list consisting of the digits of `a[i - 1]` followed by `a[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
