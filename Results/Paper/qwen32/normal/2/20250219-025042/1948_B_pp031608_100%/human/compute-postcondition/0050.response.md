The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates from `m-1` down to `1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was `n-2`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to decrease `i` by 1 because the loop decrements `i` in each iteration.

Given that `i` was `n-2` at the end of the last iteration, it should be `n-3` at the start of the next iteration. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `arr`, `nums`, `ans`) are not part of the loop head and thus should remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer and `n-1` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `n-3`. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `arr[i - 1]` is now `nums[0]`, `i` is `n-3`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
