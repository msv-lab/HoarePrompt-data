The code snippet creates a new list `nums` by converting the integer `arr[i - 1]` into a list of its digits and appending `arr[i]` to the end of this list.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `n` is an integer and `n-1` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99.
- `m` is at least 2.
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `ans` is True.
- `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`.

The code modifies the state by introducing a new list `nums`. This list is formed by taking the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and appending `arr[i]` to it.

For example, if `arr[i - 1]` is 123 and `arr[i]` is 4, then `nums` would be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

Thus, the updated state includes the new list `nums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer and `n-1` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `ans` is True, `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list consisting of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**
