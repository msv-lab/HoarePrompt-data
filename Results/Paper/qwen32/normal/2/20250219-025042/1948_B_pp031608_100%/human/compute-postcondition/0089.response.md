Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99. The function processes each test case and returns a specific result based on the values in the list `a`.**
