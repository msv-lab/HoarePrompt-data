To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `m`.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Here's the analysis:

1. The loop iterates from `m - 1` down to `1` (inclusive).
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n-1` and `n-1` must still be greater than or equal to `1`.
3. Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

So, if at the end of the previous iteration `i` was `n-1`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `n-2`.

The variable `m` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer and `n-2` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `ans` remains True or False based on the conditions specified in the loop body.**

Since `n` was used to describe the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we should keep `n` as it is and just adjust `i`:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer and `n-1` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `n-2`, `ans` remains True or False based on the conditions specified in the loop body.**

However, to be consistent with the format provided in the examples, we should express `i` directly in terms of its new value:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer and `n-1` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `n-2`, `ans` remains True or False based on the conditions specified in the loop body.**

But since `i` is directly related to the loop iteration, we can simplify it to:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer and `n-1` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `n-2`, `ans` remains True or False based on the conditions specified in the loop body.**

For clarity, let's express it directly in terms of `i`:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer and `n-1` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `n-2`, `ans` remains True or False based on the conditions specified in the loop body.**

Final simplified state:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer and `n-1` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `n-2`, `ans` remains True or False based on the conditions specified in the loop body.**

Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment, and `m` remains unchanged:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer and `n-1` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `n-2`.**

Thus, the final answer is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer and `n-1` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `n-2`.**
