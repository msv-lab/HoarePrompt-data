The code assigns the value of `k` to `cnt` and the value `1` to `l`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `v` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`), `cnt` is `k`, `l` is `1`**.
