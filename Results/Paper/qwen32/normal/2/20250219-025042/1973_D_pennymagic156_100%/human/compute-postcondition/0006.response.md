The code snippet `v = i` assigns the value of `i` to `v`. Given the initial state, `v` was previously set to the value returned by `func_2()`, which is equal to `n`. After executing the code, `v` now holds the value of `i`.

Since the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, we can only say that `v` is now equal to `i`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is equal to `i`.**
