The code snippet `cnt -= 1` decrements the value of `cnt` by 1. Given that the initial state specifies `cnt` is `k`, after executing the code, `cnt` will be `k - 1`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`), `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `i` is `2`.**
