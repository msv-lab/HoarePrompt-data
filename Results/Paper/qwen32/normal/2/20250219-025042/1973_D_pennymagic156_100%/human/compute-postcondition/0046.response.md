Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`), `cnt` is `k`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `i` is `2`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `l` is updated to be the result of `func_2()` plus 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
