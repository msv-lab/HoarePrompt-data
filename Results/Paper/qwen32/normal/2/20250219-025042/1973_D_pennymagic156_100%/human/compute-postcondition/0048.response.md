To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the `while` loop condition:

The `while` loop condition is `cnt and l < n + 1`.

- `cnt` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n` and `cnt` is initialized as `k - 1`. This means `cnt` is a non-negative integer less than `n`.
- `l` is initialized as `func_2() + 1` and `n` is a positive integer.

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions `cnt` and `l < n + 1` must be true.

Given the current state:
- `cnt` is `k - 1`, which is a non-negative integer less than `n`.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`, which is some integer value.

Since `cnt` is `k - 1` and `1 <= k <= n`, `cnt` is initially a valid positive integer (unless `k` was 1, in which case `cnt` would be 0 and the loop wouldn't execute). To ensure `cnt` remains true (non-zero), we should keep `k > 1` so that `cnt` remains a positive integer.

For `l < n + 1` to hold true, `l` should be less than `n + 1`. Since `l` is `func_2() + 1`, we need to ensure that `func_2() + 1 < n + 1`, which simplifies to `func_2() < n`.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `cnt` as long as `k > 1`. For `l`, we need to ensure that `func_2()` returns a value less than `n`.

However, since we cannot control the return value of `func_2()`, we can only ensure that the conditions based on the given variables hold true. Given that `l` is `func_2() + 1`, we can state that `l` must be less than `n + 1`.

Thus, the state should be adjusted to ensure `l < n + 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`), `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` must be less than `n + 1`, `i` is `2`**
