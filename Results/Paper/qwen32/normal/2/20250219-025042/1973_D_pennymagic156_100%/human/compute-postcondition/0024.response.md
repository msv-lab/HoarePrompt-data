To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition:

```python
while cnt and l < n + 1:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if both conditions are true:
1. `cnt` is non-zero (since `cnt` is an integer, this means `cnt != 0`).
2. `l < n + 1`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`.
- `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`).
- `cnt` is `k`.
- `l` is `1`.

Let's check the conditions:
1. Since `cnt` is initialized to `k` and `k` is between `1` and `n` (inclusive), `cnt` will be non-zero.
2. `l` is initialized to `1`, and since `n` is a positive integer, `n + 1` will always be greater than `1`. Therefore, `l < n + 1` will be true.

Since both conditions are already satisfied with the given state, no adjustments are needed.

Thus, the state remains the same:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`), `cnt` is `k`, `l` is `1`**
