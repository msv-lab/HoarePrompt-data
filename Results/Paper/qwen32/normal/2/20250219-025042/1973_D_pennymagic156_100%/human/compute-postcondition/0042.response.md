To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n // k + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`.
- `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`).
- `cnt` is `0`.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1` from the last iteration.
- Either `cnt` is not `0` or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.

Since the loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to adjust `i` to be the next value it should take in the next iteration. The loop condition is `i < n // k + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `1`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `2`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `v`, `cnt`, `l`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

Let's summarize the new state:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`), `cnt` is `0`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` from the last iteration, and either `cnt` is not `0` or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`, `i` is 2**.
