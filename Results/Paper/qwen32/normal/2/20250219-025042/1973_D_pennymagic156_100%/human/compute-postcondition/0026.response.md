The code assigns the value of `func_2() + 1` to `l`. Since the initial state specifies that `l` was `1`, it now holds the new value which is the result of `func_2()` plus one. The values of `n`, `k`, `v`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`), `cnt` is `k`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`**.
