To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State Recap:
- `n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3 * k`.
- `k` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n`.
- `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`).
- `cnt` is `k - 1`.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
- `i` is `3`.

### Variables in the Print Statement:
- `l`: This is explicitly defined as `func_2() + 1`. We don't know the exact value of `func_2()`, but we know it's an integer.
- `i`: This is explicitly given as `3`.
- `v`: This is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`). Again, we don't know the exact value, but it's an integer.

### The Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `l`**: Since `l` is defined as `func_2() + 1`, if we denote the value returned by `func_2()` as `val_func_2`, then `l = val_func_2 + 1`.
2. **Value of `i`**: `i` is explicitly given as `3`.
3. **Value of `v`**: `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`), so `v = val_func_2`.

### Substituting Values into the Print Statement:
- `l` becomes `val_func_2 + 1`.
- `i * v` becomes `3 * val_func_2`.

Thus, the print statement will output:
```
? val_func_2 + 1 3 * val_func_2
```

### Final Output Description:
The print statement will output a string starting with `?`, followed by the value of `l` which is `func_2() + 1`, and then the product of `i` and `v` which is `3 * func_2()`. Since the exact value of `func_2()` is not provided, we express the output in terms of `func_2()`.

Output: **? [func_2() + 1] [3 * func_2()] (where func_2() is the value returned by the function func_2())**
