To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze how the variables `cnt` and `l` evolve with each iteration.

- Initially, `cnt` is set to `k` and `l` is set to `1`.
- The loop continues as long as `cnt > 0` and `l < n + 1`.
- In each iteration, `cnt` is decremented by `1`, and `l` is updated to `func_2() + 1`.

From the given output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue until `cnt` reaches `0` or `l` becomes equal to `n + 1`.

Since `cnt` starts at `k` and is decremented by `1` in each iteration, the loop will run exactly `k` times if `l` does not reach `n + 1` before `cnt` reaches `0`. If `l` reaches `n + 1` before `cnt` reaches `0`, the loop will terminate early.

After `k` iterations, `cnt` will be `0`. The value of `l` after `k` iterations will depend on the values returned by `func_2()` in each iteration, but it will be `func_2() + 1` from the last iteration.

Therefore, the final output state will be:
- `cnt` will be `0`.
- `l` will be `func_2() + 1` from the last iteration of the loop.

Given that the exact value of `l` depends on the return values of `func_2()`, we can generalize that `l` will be the result of the last call to `func_2()` plus `1`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`), `cnt` is `0`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` from the last iteration.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `cnt` will be `0`, and `l` will be the result of the last call to `func_2()` plus `1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions except for `cnt` and `l`.
