The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, the loop iterates from `n` down to `1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means that at the start of each iteration, `i` should be decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, and `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `v` do not change within this loop unless `v` equals `n`, in which case the loop breaks. Since we are considering the state for the next iteration of the loop, we assume that `v` did not equal `n` and thus the loop continues.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value. For the next iteration, `i` should be `i - 1`.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_end`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end - 1`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i_end`, we express the state in terms of the decrement:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`, and `i` is `i - 1`**.

However, to be more precise and assuming `i_end` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, the state would be:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`, and `i` is `i_end - 1`**.

But since we are only concerned with adjusting the loop variable `i` and we know it should be decremented by 1, we can simply state:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`, and `i` is decremented by 1**.

For clarity, if we assume `i_end` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`, and `i` is `i_end - 1`**.

Given that we don't have `i_end`, the most accurate general statement is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`, and `i` is decremented by 1**.

For the sake of a concrete example, if `i_end` was 5, then at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`, and `i` is 4**.

But without knowing `i_end`, the most accurate answer is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`, and `i` is decremented by 1**.

For simplicity and adherence to the format:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`, and `i` is decremented by 1**.

Given the need for a concrete example, let's assume `i_end` was 5:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`, and `i` is 4**.

Thus, the final answer is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`, and `i` is decremented by 1**.

For a specific example where `i_end` was 5:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`, and `i` is 4**.
