To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's analyze the behavior of the loop and how it progresses.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop runs from `i = n` down to `i = 1`.
- For each iteration, it prints a query `? 1 {i * n}`.
- It then assigns the value returned by `func_2()` to `v`.
- If `v` equals `n`, it sets `v` to `i` and breaks out of the loop.
- If `v` does not equal `n`, the loop continues with the next iteration.

### Given Information:
- After the first iteration (`i = n`), `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`.
- After the second iteration (`i = n-1`), `v` is again the value returned by `func_2()`.
- After the third iteration (`i = n-2`), `v` is once more the value returned by `func_2()`.

### Conclusion:
- The loop will continue until either `v` equals `n` (in which case `v` is set to `i` and the loop breaks) or until `i` reaches `1`.
- If `v` never equals `n` during any of the iterations, the loop will run until `i` reaches `1`.

### Final Output State:
- If `v` equals `n` at any point during the loop, the loop breaks, and `v` is set to the current value of `i`.
- If `v` never equals `n`, the loop completes all iterations, and `i` will be `1` when the loop exits.

### Determining the Final Output State:
- Since we do not have information indicating that `v` ever equals `n` within the first three iterations, we assume the worst-case scenario where `v` never equals `n` throughout the entire loop.
- In this case, the loop will run until `i` reaches `1`.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, and `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`). If `v` equals `n`, `v` is set to `1` and the loop breaks; otherwise, `v` remains the value returned by `func_2()` and `i` is `1`.**

In simpler terms, if `v` never equals `n` during the loop, `v` will be the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`), and `i` will be `1`. If `v` equals `n` at any point, `v` will be set to that `i` value, and the loop will break early.
