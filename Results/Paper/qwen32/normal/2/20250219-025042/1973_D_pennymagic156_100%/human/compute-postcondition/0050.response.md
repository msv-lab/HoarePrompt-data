The code snippet assigns the value of `func_2() + 1` to the variable `l`. Since `l` was previously constrained to be less than `n + 1`, this constraint remains valid. The values of `n`, `k`, `v`, `cnt`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`), `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and must be less than `n + 1`, `i` is `2`**.
