Let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state step-by-step:

Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`.
- `v` is set to 1.

Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'? 1 {i * n}', flush=True)
```

In the code snippet, there is a variable `i` that is used in the expression `i * n`. However, `i` is not defined in the initial state provided. This means that the value of `i` is unknown based on the given information. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `i * n`.

Given this uncertainty about the value of `i`, we can only describe the output in terms of `i` and `n`.

Explanation:
- The string to be printed starts with `'? 1 '`.
- The next part of the string is the result of the expression `i * n`.
- Since `i` is not defined, we cannot compute the exact value of `i * n`.

Thus, the output will be in the form of `'? 1 [i * n]'` where `[i * n]` represents the product of `i` and `n`.

Output: **? 1 [i * n] (where i is an undefined integer and n is a positive integer)**
