To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head:

```
while cnt and l < n + 1:
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will execute if both `cnt` is truthy (non-zero) and `l` is less than `n + 1`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3 * k`
- `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`
- `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`)
- `cnt` is `k`
- `l` is `1`
- `i` is `3`

Let's analyze the conditions:

1. **Condition on `cnt`:**
   - `cnt` is initialized to `k`, and since `1 <= k <= n`, `cnt` is a non-zero integer.
   - Therefore, `cnt` is truthy, and this condition is satisfied.

2. **Condition on `l`:**
   - `l` is initialized to `1`.
   - The condition requires `l < n + 1`.
   - Since `n` is a positive integer, `n + 1` is always greater than `1`.
   - Therefore, `l < n + 1` is satisfied.

Since both conditions are already satisfied with the given state, no adjustments are needed for the first iteration of the loop to proceed.

Thus, the state remains unchanged:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3 * k`, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`), `cnt` is `k`, `l` is `1`, `i` is `3`**
