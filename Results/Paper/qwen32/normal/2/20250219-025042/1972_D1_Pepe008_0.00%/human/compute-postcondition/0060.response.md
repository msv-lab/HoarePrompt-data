To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement:

- `suma` is given the value `S`.
- `t` is incremented by 1 (`t = t + 1`), but this does not affect the print statement.
- `info` is a new list of strings obtained from the latest input.
- `a` is the integer value of the first element of `info` (`a = int(info[0])`).
- `b` is the integer value of the second element of `info` (`b = int(info[1])`).

The print statement is:
```python
print(suma - 1)
```

Given that `suma` is `S`, the expression `suma - 1` simplifies to `S - 1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `S - 1`.

Output: **S - 1 (where S is the value of suma)**
