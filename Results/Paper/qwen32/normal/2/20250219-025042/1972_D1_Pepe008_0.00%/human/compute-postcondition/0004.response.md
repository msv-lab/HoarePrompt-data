The provided code snippet includes nested loops and a conditional statement, but it does not modify any of the variables `T`, `info`, `a`, or `b`. Instead, it prints certain pairs `(i, j)` based on the condition specified.

Since none of the variables `T`, `info`, `a`, or `b` are altered by the code, their values remain the same. The only effect of the code is to print certain pairs `(i, j)` to the console, which does not change the state of the variables.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4; `info` is a list of strings; `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`; `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`.**
