To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`.

Given:
- The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `b` inclusive.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has some value, and `b` remains unchanged.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **Variable `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was used in the calculation of `suma` and other variables.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

2. **Variable `b`:**
   - `b` does not change within the loop; it is the upper limit of the loop.

The other variables (`suma`, `t`, `info`, `a`, `x`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be modified based on the loop head alone.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` had some value, say `k`.
- For the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.
- `b` remains the same.

### Final State:
- Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `b` remains unchanged.

State: **`suma` is either `(a + 1) + ((a - (i + 1) * i)) // (i + 1)` if `a - (i + 1) * i > 0`, or `((a - (i + 1) * i)) // (i + 1)` otherwise; `t` is incremented by 1; `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`; `b` is at least 1; `x` is `(a - (i + 1) * i)) // (i + 1)`; `i` is incremented by 1.**

However, since we are only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head (`i` and `b`), the final state relevant to the loop head is:

State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `b` remains the same.** 

For completeness, the full state would be:

State: **`suma` is either `(a + 1) + ((a - (i + 1) * i)) // (i + 1)` if `a - (i + 1) * i > 0`, or `((a - (i + 1) * i)) // (i + 1)` otherwise; `t` is incremented by 1; `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`; `b` is at least 1; `x` is `(a - (i + 1) * i)) // (i + 1)`; `i` is `i + 1`.**

But adhering strictly to the requirement of adjusting only the loop head variables:

State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `b` remains the same.**
