Given the initial state, `i` has been incremented by 1, and `b` remains unchanged. The code calculates a new value for `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.

Let's determine the new value of `x`:

- `i` is incremented by 1, so its new value is `i + 1`.
- The formula for `x` becomes `(a - (i + 1) * ((i + 1) - 1)) // (i + 1) ** 2 + 1`.
- Simplifying the expression inside the formula:
  - `(i + 1) - 1` simplifies to `i`.
  - So the formula further simplifies to `(a - (i + 1) * i) // (i + 1) ** 2 + 1`.
  - This can be written as `(a - i * (i + 1)) // (i + 1) ** 2 + 1`.

Therefore, `x` is now calculated as `(a - i * (i + 1)) // (i + 1) ** 2 + 1`.

The value of `b` remains unchanged, and `i` is now `i + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `b` remains the same; `x` is `(a - i * (i + 1)) // (i + 1) ** 2 + 1`.**
