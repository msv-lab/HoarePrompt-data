Output State: **`suma` is either `a + 1` if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, or it remains `0` otherwise, `t` is incremented by 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is at least 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `x` has been updated to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged except for `x`, which now holds the new calculated value.
