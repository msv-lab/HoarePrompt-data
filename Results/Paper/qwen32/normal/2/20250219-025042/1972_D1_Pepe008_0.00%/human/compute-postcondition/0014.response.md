Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is incremented by 1. If `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, `suma` is recalculated as the old value of `suma` plus `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i` and `x` is set to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. Otherwise, `suma` remains unchanged and `x` is not recalculated.**
