The code snippet `suma += x` adds the current value of `x` to `suma`. Given the initial state, `suma` was initially 0. After executing the code, `suma` will hold the value of `x`.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `suma` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, and `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0.**
