### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem by iterating through possible values of `b` and calculating the number of valid `a` values for each `b` that satisfy the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, there are several issues with the current implementation:

1. **Incorrect Loop Range for `b`:** The loop for `b` should iterate from 1 to `m`, not from 1 to `b + 1`. The variable `b` is being used as both the loop variable and the upper limit of the loop, which is incorrect.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `x`:** The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` does not correctly calculate the number of valid `a` values for each `b`. This formula seems to be an attempt to optimize the counting process, but it does not accurately reflect the logic required to count the valid pairs.

3. **Subtracting 1 from the Sum:** The final result is printed as `suma - 1`, which suggests that the initial calculation might be overcounting by 1. However, this adjustment is not logically justified based on the provided code and the problem statement.

4. **Unnecessary Commented Code:** There is a commented-out section of nested loops that would have brute-forced the solution by checking every pair `(i, j)`. While this approach would be correct, it is inefficient for large inputs and was likely replaced by the current formula-based approach.

Given these issues, the current implementation does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for counting valid pairs needs to be corrected to properly reflect the conditions given in the problem statement.

### Correctness: **False**
