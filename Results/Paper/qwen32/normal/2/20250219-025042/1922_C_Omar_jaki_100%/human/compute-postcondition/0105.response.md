To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `u` is at least 1 (though `u` is not used in the print statement).
- `c` and `d` are the values returned by the function `r()`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Function `r()`**: Since the function `r()` is not defined, we don't know the exact values of `c` and `d`. However, we can assume that `r()` returns two integers.
2. **List `b`**: The list `b` is also not defined in the initial state. We need to assume that it exists and contains enough elements to support the indices `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1`.

### Calculation:
- The expression `c * 2 - 1` calculates an index for the list `b`.
- Similarly, the expression `d * 2 - 1` calculates another index for the list `b`.
- The code then prints the difference between the elements at these two indices in the list `b`.

### Output Description:
Given the lack of specific values for `c`, `d`, and the list `b`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1] (where c and d are the values returned by r(), and b is the list from which elements are being accessed)**
