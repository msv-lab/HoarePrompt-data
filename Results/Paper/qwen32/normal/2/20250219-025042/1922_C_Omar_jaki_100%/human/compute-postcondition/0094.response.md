The function `r()` returns a tuple of two truthy values. After executing the line `c, d = r()`, the variables `c` and `d` are assigned these two truthy values returned by `r()`. The initial state of `u` being a truthy value decremented by 1 remains unchanged unless `u` is directly modified within the code snippet, which it is not here.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`u` is a truthy value decremented by 1, `c` is a truthy value, `d` is a truthy value**.
