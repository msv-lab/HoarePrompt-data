To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition `u` in the loop head. The loop will execute if `u` evaluates to `True`.

Given:
- The state right before the `while` loop is: `[0, 0, S_1, S_1, S_2, S_2, ..., S_{n-2}, S_{n-2}]; u` is the value returned by `r()`

The `while` loop statement is:
```python
while u:
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute, `u` must be `True`. Since `u` is the value returned by the function `r()`, we need to ensure that `r()` returns `True`.

### Analysis:
- The list `[0, 0, S_1, S_1, S_2, S_2, ..., S_{n-2}, S_{n-2}]` does not directly influence the value of `u`.
- The only variable in the loop head is `u`, which is determined by the return value of `r()`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust the state such that `u` is `True`. Since `u` is the result of `r()`, we need to assume or ensure that `r()` returns `True`.

Therefore, the state should be modified to reflect that `u` must be `True`.

### Final State:
State: **`[0, 0, S_1, S_1, S_2, S_2, ..., S_{n-2}, S_{n-2}]; u` must be `True`**
