Postcondition: **The list is \([0, 0, (2000000000.0 - r_result \text{ if } 2000000000.0 - r_result > r_result + 1000000000.0 \text{ else } 1), (2000000000.0 - r_result \text{ if } 2000000000.0 - r_result > additional\_element - 2000000000.0 \text{ else } 1)]\), \( u \) is non-zero and has been decreased by 1, \( c \) is the first value returned by \( r() \), and \( d \) is the second value returned by \( r() \). Additionally, \( c \) is greater than or equal to \( d \).**
