To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `u` is at least 0 (though `u` is not used in the print statement).
   - `c` and `d` are the values returned by the function `r()`.
   - There is a condition `c < d` which either holds true or does not hold true.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is: `print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])`.
   - This statement calculates the difference between two elements of the list `b`. Specifically, it subtracts the element at index `(c - 1) * 2` from the element at index `(d - 1) * 2`.

3. **Understanding Indices:**
   - The indices `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2` depend on the values of `c` and `d`.
   - Since `c` and `d` are returned by `r()`, their exact values are not specified. However, we know that `c < d` if the condition holds true.

4. **Output Description:**
   - The output will be the result of the subtraction `b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]`.
   - Without knowing the specific values of `c`, `d`, and the contents of the list `b`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Given this analysis, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2] (where c and d are the values returned by r(), and b is a list)**
