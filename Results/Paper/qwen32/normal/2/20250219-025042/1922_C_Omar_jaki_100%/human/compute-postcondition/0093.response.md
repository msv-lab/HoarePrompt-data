The value of `u` is decremented by 1. Initially, `u` is the value returned by `r()`, and `r()` must return a truthy value. After decrementing, `u` will still be a truthy value unless it was 1 initially (since 0 is falsy). The precondition that `r()` returns a truthy value remains valid unless `u` was exactly 1 before the operation.

Output State: **`u` is a truthy value decremented by 1, `r()` must return a truthy value**.
