To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

1. `u` is a truthy value decremented by 1. This means `u` was originally a truthy value (non-zero, non-empty, etc.), and then it was decremented by 1. However, the value of `u` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this calculation.
2. `c` is a truthy value.
3. `d` is a truthy value.
4. `c` is less than `d`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

For this statement to execute correctly, there must be a list `b` defined elsewhere in the code, and it must have enough elements to support the indices `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2`.

Given that `c` and `d` are truthy values and `c < d`, let's denote the values of `c` and `d` as `c_value` and `d_value` respectively. The expression `(d - 1) * 2` translates to `(d_value - 1) * 2`, and `(c - 1) * 2` translates to `(c_value - 1) * 2`.

Thus, the print statement calculates the difference between the elements at indices `(d_value - 1) * 2` and `(c_value - 1) * 2` in the list `b`.

Since the specific values of `c_value` and `d_value` and the contents of the list `b` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical output. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables and the list `b`.

Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2] (where `b` is a list, `c` is a truthy value less than `d`, and both `c` and `d` are truthy values)**
