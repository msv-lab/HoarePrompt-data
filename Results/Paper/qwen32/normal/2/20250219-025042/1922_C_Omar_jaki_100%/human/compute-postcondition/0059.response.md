To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step-by-step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- The list `b` is defined as:
  \[
  \left[0, 0, \left(2000000000.0 - r\_result \text{ if } 2000000000.0 - r\_result > r\_result + 1000000000.0 \text{ else } 1\right), \left(2000000000.0 - r\_result \text{ if } 2000000000.0 - r\_result > additional\_element - 2000000000.0 \text{ else } 1\right)\right]
  \]

- `u` is non-zero and has been decreased by 1.
- `c` is the first value returned by `r()` and is less than `d`, which is the second value returned by `r()`.

### Code Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

Let's analyze the indices used in the list `b`:
- `(d - 1) * 2`: Since `d` is the second value returned by `r()` and `c` is the first value returned by `r()`, and both are indices into the list `b`, we need to consider the positions they point to.
- `(c - 1) * 2`: Similarly, this will point to another position in the list `b`.

Given the structure of the list `b`, the only non-zero elements are potentially at indices 2 and 3, depending on the conditions involving `r_result` and `additional_element`.

### Determining the Values:
- If `d = 2` and `c = 1` (as typical for the first two values returned by `r()`):
  - `(d - 1) * 2 = (2 - 1) * 2 = 2`
  - `(c - 1) * 2 = (1 - 1) * 2 = 0`

Thus, the print statement evaluates to:
```python
print(b[2] - b[0])
```

- `b[0]` is `0` (as per the list definition).
- `b[2]` depends on the condition:
  \[
  b[2] = \left(2000000000.0 - r\_result \text{ if } 2000000000.0 - r\_result > r\_result + 1000000000.0 \text{ else } 1\right)
  \]

### Evaluating `b[2]`:
- Let's denote `2000000000.0 - r_result` as `X`.
- The condition becomes: `X > r_result + 1000000000.0`.
- Rearranging, we get: `2000000000.0 > 2 * r_result + 1000000000.0` or `1000000000.0 > 2 * r_result` or `500000000.0 > r_result`.

So, if `r_result < 500000000.0`, then `b[2] = 2000000000.0 - r_result`; otherwise, `b[2] = 1`.

### Final Calculation:
- If `b[2] = 2000000000.0 - r_result`:
  \[
  \text{Output} = (2000000000.0 - r\_result) - 0 = 2000000000.0 - r\_result
  \]

- If `b[2] = 1`:
  \[
  \text{Output} = 1 - 0 = 1
  \]

### Conclusion:
Based on the conditions provided, the output will depend on the value of `r_result`. Therefore, the precise output can be described as follows:

Output: **2000000000.0 - r_result (if r_result < 500000000.0) or 1 (if r_result >= 500000000.0)**
