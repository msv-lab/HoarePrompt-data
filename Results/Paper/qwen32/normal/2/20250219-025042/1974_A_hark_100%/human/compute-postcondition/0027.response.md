The initial state provides details about several variables (`t`, `ap`, `x`, `y`, and `k`), but the `print` statement in the provided code snippet does not reference any of these variables. Instead, it directly prints the integer `0`.

Here's the breakdown:

- `t`: An integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.
- `ap`: An integer that is greater than or equal to 1.
- `x` and `y`: Integers between 0 and 99 inclusive.
- `k`: An integer that is incremented by 1 (though the current value of `k` is not relevant to the `print` statement).

Since the `print` statement is `print(0)`, it will output the number `0` regardless of the values of `t`, `ap`, `x`, `y`, or `k`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply `0`.

Output: **0**
