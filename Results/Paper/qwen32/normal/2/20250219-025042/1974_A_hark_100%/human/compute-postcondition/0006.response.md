Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is updated to `x - (ceiling(y / 2) * 15) + (y * 4)`, `y` is the same integer read from the input such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 99, and both `x` and `y` are greater than 0; `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`; `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x <= 0` else the ceiling of `x / 15`.**

Explanation: The variable `bxsfory1` is calculated based on the condition that if `x` is less than or equal to 0, then `bxsfory1` is set to 0; otherwise, it is set to the ceiling of `x / 15`. All other variables retain their initial values or updated values as per the given conditions.
