The value of `x` is updated based on the given formula. The new value of `x` is calculated as `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, `y` is the integer read from the input, `k` is incremented by 1, `bxsfory` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`.**
