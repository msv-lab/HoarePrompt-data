To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
- `ap` is greater than or equal to 1. Again, `ap` is not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
- `x` is 0. This variable is also not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
- `y` is an integer greater than 0. This variable is used in the provided code snippet.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(math.ceil(y / 2))
```

Here, `math.ceil(y / 2)` computes the ceiling of `y / 2`, which means it rounds up to the nearest integer. Since `y` is an integer greater than 0, `y / 2` will be a positive number, and `math.ceil(y / 2)` will round this number up to the nearest whole number.

For example:
- If `y = 1`, then `y / 2 = 0.5` and `math.ceil(0.5) = 1`.
- If `y = 2`, then `y / 2 = 1.0` and `math.ceil(1.0) = 1`.
- If `y = 3`, then `y / 2 = 1.5` and `math.ceil(1.5) = 2`.

Given that `y` is any integer greater than 0, the output will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2` (where `y` is an integer greater than 0)**
