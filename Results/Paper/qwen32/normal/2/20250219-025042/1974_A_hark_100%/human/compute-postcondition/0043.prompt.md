Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers x and y such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `ap` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(ap):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
    else:
        print(0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, then `x` is updated to `x - (ceiling(y / 2) * 15) + (y * 4)`, `y` remains unchanged, `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`, and `bxsfory1` is the ceiling of `x / 15` if `x > 0` else 0. Otherwise, if `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, `x` remains 0 and `y` remains greater than 0. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, `x` remains greater than 0 and `y` remains 0. In all other cases, either `x` is less than or equal to 0 or `y` is less than or equal to 0, and it is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, and it is not the case that `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, and `k` is incremented by 1. If `x > 0` and `y > 0`, then `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` where `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is `math.ceil(x / 15)`. If either `x == 0` or `y == 0`, `x` and `y` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is incremented by 1. If `x > 0 and y > 0`, then `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` where `bxsfory` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x <= 0` else the smallest integer greater than or equal to `x / 15`. If `x <= 0 or y <= 0`, then `x` and `y` remain the same integers read from the input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
