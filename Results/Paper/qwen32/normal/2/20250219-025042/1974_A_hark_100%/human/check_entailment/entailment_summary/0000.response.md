### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

1. **Grid Size and Icon Placement:**
   - Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which means it has a total of 15 cells.
   - A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
   - A 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.

2. **Test Case Processing:**
   - The program reads `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

3. **Logic for Calculating Minimum Screens:**
   - **Case 1:** Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0.
     - It calculates `bxsfory` as the ceiling of `y / 2`. This represents the minimum number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons, considering that each screen can hold at most 2 such icons (since each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells and a screen has 15 cells, we can fit at most 3 2x2 icons per screen, but since they must not overlap, we fit at most 2).
     - It then adjusts `x` by subtracting `bxsfory * 15` (which seems incorrect as it should consider the actual space used by 2x2 icons, not the entire screen capacity) and adding `y * 4` (which also seems incorrect as it adds back the space used by 2x2 icons).
     - It calculates `bxsfory1` as the ceiling of the adjusted `x` divided by 15, representing the minimum number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
     - Finally, it prints the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.

   - **Case 2:** Only `y` is greater than 0.
     - It calculates `bxsfory` as the ceiling of `y / 2` and prints it, which is correct as each screen can hold at most 2 2x2 icons.

   - **Case 3:** Only `x` is greater than 0.
     - It calculates the ceiling of `x / 15` and prints it, which is correct as each screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons.

   - **Case 4:** Both `x` and `y` are 0.
     - It correctly prints `0` as no screens are needed.

### Issues Identified:
- The logic for adjusting `x` when both `x` and `y` are greater than 0 seems flawed. Subtracting `bxsfory * 15` does not accurately reflect the space used by 2x2 icons, and adding `y * 4` back is incorrect.
- The calculation of `bxsfory1` does not account for the space already occupied by 2x2 icons.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the logic for handling cases where both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
