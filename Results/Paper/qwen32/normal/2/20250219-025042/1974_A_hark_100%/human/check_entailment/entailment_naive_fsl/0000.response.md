Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description. Let's analyze the code step-by-step:

1. **Function Definition Issue**: The function `func_1()` is defined after it is called. This will result in a `NameError` because `func_1()` is not recognized when it is initially called.

2. **Logic for Placing Icons**:
   - The logic for calculating the number of screens required is flawed.
   - Specifically, the calculation `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. It does not properly account for the placement of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.
   - The formula `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)` is correct for determining the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons since each screen can hold up to 2 such icons. However, the subsequent calculations do not correctly handle the remaining 1x1 icons.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles some edge cases correctly, like when `x == 0` and `y > 0`, or when `x > 0` and `y == 0`.
   - However, it fails to correctly calculate the number of screens required when both `x` and `y` are non-zero.

Let's consider a specific test case where the program fails:

**Test Case**:
```
1
10 2
```

**Expected Output**:
```
2
```

**Explanation**:
- We need to place 10 1x1 icons and 2 2x2 icons.
- One screen can accommodate 2 2x2 icons, which leaves us with 1 screen used for 2x2 icons.
- After placing the 2x2 icons, we have 7 cells left on that screen (since 2x2 icons occupy 4 cells, leaving 15 - 4 = 11 cells, but we need to consider the arrangement).
- We need to place 10 1x1 icons, and since one screen already has 7 cells occupied, we need an additional screen to place the remaining 3 1x1 icons.
- Therefore, the total number of screens required is 2.

However, the program will likely output an incorrect value due to the flawed logic in handling the placement of 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons.

Thus, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
