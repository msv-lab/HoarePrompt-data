Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by calling `func_1()` before defining it, which will cause a `NameError`. This is a critical issue.
   - Once the function is defined, it reads the number of test cases (`ap`) from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`.

2. **Logic for Calculating Screens:**
   - **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:**
     - It calculates `bxsfory` as the ceiling of `y / 2`, which represents the minimum number of screens needed just for the `2x2` icons.
     - It then adjusts `x` by subtracting `bxsfory * 15` (which seems incorrect because `bxsfory` screens can hold `bxsfory * 4` `2x2` icons, not `15` `1x1` icons) and adding `y * 4` (which doesn't make sense in this context).
     - It calculates `bxsfory1` as the ceiling of the adjusted `x` divided by `15` (again, `15` seems incorrect here).
     - Finally, it prints the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.
   - **Case 2: `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0:**
     - It correctly calculates the number of screens needed for `2x2` icons as the ceiling of `y / 2`.
   - **Case 3: `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0:**
     - It correctly calculates the number of screens needed for `1x1` icons as the ceiling of `x / 15` (though `15` should be `15` cells, but the grid is `5x3` which is `15` cells, so this is correct).
   - **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0:**
     - It correctly outputs `0` screens.

### Issues Identified:
- The program incorrectly handles the calculation of screens when both `x` and `y` are greater than 0. Specifically, the logic for adjusting `x` and calculating `bxsfory1` is flawed.
- The program calls `func_1()` before defining it, which will cause a runtime error.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, particularly the incorrect logic for handling the case where both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, and the fact that the program attempts to call a function before defining it, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
