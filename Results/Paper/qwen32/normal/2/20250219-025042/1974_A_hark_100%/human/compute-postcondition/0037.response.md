Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `ap` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `x` and `y` are integers read from the input.
- `k` is incremented by 1, but this does not affect the `print` statement.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(math.ceil(y / 2))
```

To determine the output, we need to focus on the expression inside the `print` function: `math.ceil(y / 2)`. This expression calculates the ceiling of the division of `y` by 2. The `math.ceil` function returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the given number.

Given that `y` is an integer, `y / 2` will be a float. The `math.ceil` function will then round this float up to the nearest integer.

For example:
- If `y` is 5, `y / 2` is 2.5, and `math.ceil(2.5)` is 3.
- If `y` is 6, `y / 2` is 3.0, and `math.ceil(3.0)` is 3.
- If `y` is 7, `y / 2` is 3.5, and `math.ceil(3.5)` is 4.

Since the exact value of `y` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine a specific numerical output. However, we can describe the output in terms of `y`.

Output: **the smallest integer greater than or equal to y / 2 (where y is the integer read from the input)**
