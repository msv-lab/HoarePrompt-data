The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000, and for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` between 0 and 99. The variable `ap` must be greater than or equal to 1, but it is not affected by the given code snippet.

After executing the code, the values of `x` and `y` are updated to the integers read from the input. The value of `t` and the condition that `ap` must be greater than or equal to 1 remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` must be greater than or equal to 1, `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.**
