The code snippet `d[i] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1.

Given the Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100
- `w` is 1
- `ln` is an input integer
- `palka` is a list of integers read from the new input and must contain at least one element
- `pl` is an empty list
- `d` is an empty dictionary
- `shapes` is the number of unique elements in the old `palka` that appear at least 3 times
- `d.get(i)` is not None (which implies that `i` is already a key in `d`)

After executing `d[i] += 1`, the value of `d[i]` increases by 1. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the new input and must contain at least one element; `pl` is an empty list; `d` is a dictionary where the value associated with key `i` has been incremented by 1; `shapes` is the number of unique elements in the old `palka` that appear at least 3 times.**
