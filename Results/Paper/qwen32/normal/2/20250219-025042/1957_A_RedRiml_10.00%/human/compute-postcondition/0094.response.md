Postcondition: **`d` is a dictionary where if `i` was not originally a key, it is now added with a value of 1. If `i` was already a key, its value is incremented by 1. `pl` is a list that may or may not contain the element `i` depending on whether `i` was originally in `pl` or not. `shapes` is updated to reflect the total number of elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`. `w` is `k-1`, `ln` is an input integer, and `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must contain at least one element. If `i` was not in `pl`, `pl` now includes `i`.**
