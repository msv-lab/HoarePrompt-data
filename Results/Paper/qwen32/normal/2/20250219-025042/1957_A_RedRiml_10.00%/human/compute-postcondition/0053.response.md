The code appends the variable `i` to the list `pl`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the new input and must contain at least one element; `pl` is a list containing the element `i`; `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` either has been added with the value `1` (if it did not exist before) or its existing value has been incremented by 1; `shapes` is the number of unique elements in the old `palka` that appear at least 3 times; `i` is not in `pl` (before appending).**
