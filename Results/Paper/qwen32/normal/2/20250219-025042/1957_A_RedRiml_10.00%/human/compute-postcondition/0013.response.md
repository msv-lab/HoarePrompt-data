The code snippet `pl.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pl`. Since `pl` was initially an empty list, after executing this line, `pl` will contain one element, which is the value of `i`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
- `w` remains 1.
- `ln` remains an input integer.
- `palka` remains a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element.
- `pl` is now a list containing one element, which is `i`.
- `d` remains a dictionary with the same conditions as before: If `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, then `d` now contains the key-value pair `{i: 1}`. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by 1. Additionally, `i` is not in `pl` (this condition is no longer relevant since `i` has just been added to `pl`).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element; `pl` is a list containing one element, which is `i`; `d` is a dictionary where if `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, then `d` now contains the key-value pair `{i: 1}`, otherwise `d[i]` is incremented by 1.**
