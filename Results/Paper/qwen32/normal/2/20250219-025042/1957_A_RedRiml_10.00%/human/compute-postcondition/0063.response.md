The code snippet `d[i] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1. If `i` was not previously in `d`, it would first be added with a default value of 1, and then incremented by 1, making its value 2.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `d`. The value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the new input and must contain at least one element; `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` has a value of either 2 (if `i` was not previously in `d`) or its existing value incremented by 1; `shapes` is the number of unique elements in the old `palka` that appear at least 3 times; `i` is the next element in `palka` after the current `i`.**
