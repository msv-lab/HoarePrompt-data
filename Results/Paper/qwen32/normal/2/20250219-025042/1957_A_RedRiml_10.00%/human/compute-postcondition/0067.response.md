To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables `d` and `pl` based on the contents of the list `palka`.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `d` starts as an empty dictionary.
   - `pl` starts as an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each element `i` in `palka`, the loop performs the following:
     - It checks if `i` is already a key in the dictionary `d`.
       - If `i` is not in `d`, it adds `i` to `d` with a value of 1.
       - If `i` is already in `d`, it increments the value associated with `i` by 1.
     - It checks if `i` is not already in the list `pl`.
       - If `i` is not in `pl`, it appends `i` to `pl`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After processing all elements in `palka`, the dictionary `d` will contain each unique element from `palka` as keys, with their corresponding values representing the count of occurrences of each element in `palka`.
   - The list `pl` will contain all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared.

4. **Variable `shapes`**:
   - The variable `shapes` is defined as the number of unique elements in the old `palka` that appear at least 3 times. This value does not change during the loop but rather is computed based on the final state of `d` after the loop completes.

Given these points, the final output state can be described as follows:

- `d` will be a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `palka` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element.
- `pl` will be a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared.
- `shapes` will be calculated based on the final state of `d` to determine how many elements appear at least 3 times.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`d` is a dictionary with counts of each unique element in `palka`; `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared; `shapes` is the number of unique elements in `palka` that appear at least 3 times.**

In simpler terms, `d` will tell us how many times each number appears, `pl` will list all unique numbers in the order they were first seen, and `shapes` will tell us how many numbers appear at least three times.
