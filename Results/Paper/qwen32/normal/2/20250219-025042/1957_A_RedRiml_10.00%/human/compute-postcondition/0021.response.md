The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over the elements in the list `palka`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration and how it changes as the loop progresses.

Given:
- `i` is the next element in `palka` after the current `i` at the end of the previous iteration.
- `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element.

Since `i` takes on each value in `palka` sequentially, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in `palka` following its current value.

Let's denote the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_current`. The next value of `i` at the start of the next iteration will be `i_next`, which is the subsequent element in `palka`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` will be `i_next`, which is the next element in `palka` after `i_current`.

Since no other variables in the loop head (`palka`) are modified within the loop, their states remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element; `pl` is a list that contains the element `i` if `i` was not already in `pl`; `d` is a dictionary where if `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, then `d[i]` is now 1, otherwise `d[i]` is incremented by 1; `i` is the next element in `palka` after the current `i`**.

To be more specific, if `i_current` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, then:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element; `pl` is a list that contains the element `i` if `i` was not already in `pl`; `d` is a dictionary where if `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, then `d[i]` is now 1, otherwise `d[i]` is incremented by 1; `i` is the next element in `palka` after `i_current`**.
