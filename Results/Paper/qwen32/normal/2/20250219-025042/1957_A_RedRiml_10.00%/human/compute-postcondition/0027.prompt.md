Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input; `pl` is an empty list; `d` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element; `pl` is a list that may contain the element `i` if `i` was not already in `pl`; `d` is a dictionary where if `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, then `d` now contains the key-value pair `{i: 1}`, otherwise `d[i]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element; `pl` is a list that contains the element `i` if `i` was not already in `pl`; `d` is a dictionary where if `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, then `d[i]` is now 1, otherwise `d[i]` is incremented by 1; `i` is the next element in `palka` after the current `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element; `pl` is a list that contains the element `i` if `i` was not already in `pl` (now includes the new element `i` if `i` was not in `pl` previously); `d` is a dictionary where if `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, then `d[i]` is now 1, otherwise `d[i]` is incremented by 1; `i` is the next element in `palka` after `i_current`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
