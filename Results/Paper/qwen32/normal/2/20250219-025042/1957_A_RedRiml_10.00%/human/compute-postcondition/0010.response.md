The given code snippet increments the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1. 

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `d[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element; `pl` is an empty list; `d` is a dictionary and `d.get(i)` is not None; `d[i]` is incremented by 1.**
