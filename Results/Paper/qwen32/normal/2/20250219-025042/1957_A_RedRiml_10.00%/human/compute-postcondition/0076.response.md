The only object in the loop head is the variable `j` and the list `pl`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `pl`. If `pl` has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute again for the third element.

At the end of the last iteration, `pl` has at least 2 elements, and `j` is the second element in `pl`. For the loop to execute one more time, `pl` must have at least 3 elements, and `j` should be the third element in `pl`.

State: **`d` is a dictionary with counts of each unique element in `palka`, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` that must have at least 3 elements, `j` is the third element in `pl`. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is incremented by 1.**
