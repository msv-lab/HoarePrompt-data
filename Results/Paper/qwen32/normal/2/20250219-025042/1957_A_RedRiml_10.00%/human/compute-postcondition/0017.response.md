The given code snippet increments the count of the current element `i` in the dictionary `d`. If `i` was not already a key in `d`, it would have been added with a value of 1, and then incremented to 2. If `i` was already a key, its value would simply be incremented by 1.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `d`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `ln`, `palka`, and `pl` remain unchanged. The variable `i` remains the same as well since it is just used to index into `d`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element; `pl` is a list that may contain the element `i` if `i` was not already in `pl`; `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is incremented by 1; `i` is the next element in `palka` after the current `i`.**
