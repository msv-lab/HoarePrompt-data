Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input; `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `palka` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `palka`; `shapes` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `shapes` is initialized to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
