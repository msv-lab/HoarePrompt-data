The code assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. Since `d` was initially an empty dictionary, after this operation, `d` will have one key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is `1`.

The other variables (`pl`, `shapes`, `w`, `ln`, `palka`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by the given code snippet.

The variable `shapes` represents the total number of elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`. Since `d` was empty before and only one element (`i`) has been added with a count of `1`, `shapes` remains `0`.

The value of `w` is `k-1`, but since `k` is not mentioned or changed in the code snippet, `w` remains `k-1`.

The variable `ln` is an input integer and `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must contain at least one element. These variables are also unaffected by the code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`d` is a dictionary with one key-value pair `{i: 1}`, `pl` is an empty list, `shapes` is 0, `w` is `k-1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must contain at least one element.**
