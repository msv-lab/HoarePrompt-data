The given code snippet only updates the value of `required_mod_y` to be equal to `mod_y`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary with the count of `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - (num % x)) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `num` is the next element in `a`**.

In simpler terms, the value of `required_mod_y` is now equal to `mod_y`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
