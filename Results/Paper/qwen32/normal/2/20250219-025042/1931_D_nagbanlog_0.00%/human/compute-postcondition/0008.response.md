The given code snippet calculates `mod_x` as the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`. However, the variable `num` is not defined in the initial state provided. Assuming `num` was intended to be `y` (as it's the only other integer variable mentioned in the context), the calculation would be `mod_x = y % x`.

Given this assumption, here is the output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a) with 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `results` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0, `mod_x` is `y % x`.**

In natural language: The value of `mod_x` is now equal to `y % x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
