To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze whether it correctly counts the number of beautiful pairs according to the problem description.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Condition for Beautiful Pairs**:
   - A pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is beautiful if:
     - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
     - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

2. **Mathematical Representation**:
   - For \(a_i + a_j\) to be divisible by \(x\), \((a_i \% x + a_j \% x) \% x = 0\).
   - For \(a_i - a_j\) to be divisible by \(y\), \((a_i \% y - a_j \% y) \% y = 0\).

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - The code uses a frequency dictionary `freq` to keep track of pairs of remainders \((a_i \% x, a_i \% y)\).
   - For each element `num` in the array, it calculates `mod_x` and `mod_y`.
   - It then calculates `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x` and `required_mod_y` as `mod_y`.
   - If the pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in `freq`, it adds the count to `beautiful_count`.
   - Finally, it updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(mod_x, mod_y)`.

### Analysis of the Implementation:
- The calculation of `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x` is intended to find the complement remainder such that when added to `mod_x`, the result is divisible by `x`. This part is correct.
- However, the calculation of `required_mod_y` as `mod_y` is incorrect. For the difference condition to hold, we need to find a pair where `(mod_x, mod_y)` and `(mod_x', mod_y')` satisfy:
  - \((mod_x + mod_x') \% x = 0\)
  - \((mod_y - mod_y') \% y = 0\)

  Therefore, `required_mod_y` should be calculated as `(mod_y - mod_y) % y` which simplifies to `mod_y` only if `mod_y == mod_y'`. But the correct approach would be to consider the complement modulo `y` for the difference condition, which is not handled correctly in the provided code.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle the second condition for beautiful pairs due to the incorrect calculation of `required_mod_y`.

**Correctness: False**
