Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains the parameters `n`, `x`, `y` and the array `a`).
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.
   
2. **Iterating Over Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a`.
   - It initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` encountered so far.
   - It initializes `beautiful_count` to zero to count the number of beautiful pairs.

3. **Processing Each Number in the Array**:
   - For each number `num` in the array `a`, it calculates `mod_x` as `num % x` and `mod_y` as `num % y`.
   - It calculates `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x`. This is the value that `mod_x` of a potential pair element should have to satisfy the condition `(a_i + a_j) % x == 0`.
   - It keeps `required_mod_y` as `mod_y` because for the condition `(a_i - a_j) % y == 0` to hold, `a_i % y` and `a_j % y` must be the same.
   - If the pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in the frequency dictionary `freq`, it means there are numbers previously seen that can form a beautiful pair with the current number. Thus, it adds the frequency of this pair to `beautiful_count`.
   - It updates the frequency dictionary `freq` with the current pair `(mod_x, mod_y)`.

4. **Storing Results**:
   - After processing all numbers in the array, it appends the `beautiful_count` to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it returns the `results` list containing the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Correctness Evaluation

The logic of the program seems correct based on the problem statement. Here's why:

- The program correctly identifies the conditions for a pair to be beautiful: `(a_i + a_j) % x == 0` and `(a_i - a_j) % y == 0`.
- By using the modulo values and their complements, it efficiently counts the number of such pairs without needing to check every possible pair explicitly, which would be computationally expensive.
- The use of a frequency dictionary ensures that the solution is efficient and works within the constraints.

### Conclusion

The program appears to implement the correct algorithm to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
