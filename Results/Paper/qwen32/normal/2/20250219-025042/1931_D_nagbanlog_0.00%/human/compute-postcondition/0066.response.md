Given the initial state and the code snippet provided, the only variable that gets updated is `mod_y`. The value of `mod_y` is calculated as `num % y`, where `num` is the first element of the array `a` and `y` is the third element of the tuple `case['params']`.

Since the exact values of `num` and `y` are not specified, we can only express `mod_y` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary with `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `num` is the first element of `a`**.

In simpler terms, `mod_y` is now `num % y`, and all other variables remain unchanged.
