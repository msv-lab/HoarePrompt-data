Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary, `mod_x` is `y % x`, `mod_y` is `x % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - (y % x)) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `x % y`. If `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not in `freq`, `freq` includes the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` with the value `0`. Otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged.**
