The code calculates `required_mod_x` using the formula `(x - mod_x) % x`. Given that `mod_x` is already calculated as `y % x`, we substitute `mod_x` into the formula.

Thus, `required_mod_x` becomes `(x - (y % x)) % x`.

No other variables are modified in the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a) with 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `results` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0, `mod_x` is `y % x`, `mod_y` is `x % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - (y % x)) % x`.**
