The given Python code snippet initializes the variable `beautiful_count` to 0. No other variables are modified by this code. Therefore, the output state reflects this initialization while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']`, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0.**
