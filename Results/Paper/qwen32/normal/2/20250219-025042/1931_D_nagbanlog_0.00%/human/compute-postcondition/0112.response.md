The code snippet provided sets `required_mod_y` to the current value of `mod_y`. This means that `required_mod_y` will now hold the same value as `mod_y`. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case and the newly appended `beautiful_count`, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `num` is the next element in `a`**.

In simpler terms, the value of `required_mod_y` is updated to match `mod_y`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
