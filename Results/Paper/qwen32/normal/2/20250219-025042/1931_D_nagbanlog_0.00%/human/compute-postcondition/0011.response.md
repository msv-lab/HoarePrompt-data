The code snippet assigns the value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. Since `mod_y` is calculated as `x % y`, the value of `required_mod_y` will also be `x % y`.

Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a) with 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `results` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0, `mod_x` is `y % x`, `mod_y` is `x % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - (y % x)) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `x % y`.**
