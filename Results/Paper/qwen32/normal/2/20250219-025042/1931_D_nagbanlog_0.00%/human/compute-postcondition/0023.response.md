Given the provided code snippet and initial state, let's determine the output state:

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a)
- `results` is an empty list
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from `case['params']`
- `a` is `case['array']` and must contain at least one element
- `freq` is a dictionary with the count of `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1
- `mod_x` is `num % x`
- `mod_y` is `num % y`
- `required_mod_x` is `(x - (y % x)) % x`
- `required_mod_y` is `x % y`
- `num` is the next element in `a`

Code Snippet:
```python
required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
```

Impact of the Code:
- The variable `required_mod_x` is updated based on the current values of `x` and `mod_x`.

Since `mod_x` is defined as `num % x`, the new value of `required_mod_x` is calculated using the formula `(x - (num % x)) % x`. This calculation does not affect any other variables in the given initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary with the count of `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - (num % x)) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `x % y`, `num` is the next element in `a`**.

In simpler terms, the value of `required_mod_x` has been recalculated to `(x - (num % x)) % x`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
