Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to find pairs of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) such that:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

### Mathematical Conditions:
- For \(a_i + a_j\) to be divisible by \(x\), we need:
  \[
  (a_i + a_j) \% x = 0 \implies a_i \% x + a_j \% x \equiv 0 \pmod{x} \implies a_i \% x = -a_j \% x \pmod{x}
  \]
  Since modulo operations yield non-negative results, this translates to:
  \[
  a_i \% x = (x - a_j \% x) \% x
  \]
- For \(a_i - a_j\) to be divisible by \(y\), we need:
  \[
  (a_i - a_j) \% y = 0 \implies a_i \% y = a_j \% y
  \]

### Approach:
The program uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs \((a_i \% x, a_i \% y)\). For each element \(a_i\) in the array, it calculates the required pair \((\text{required\_mod\_x}, \text{required\_mod\_y})\) that would form a beautiful pair with \(a_i\). If this pair exists in `freq`, it adds the frequency of this pair to the count of beautiful pairs.

### Detailed Steps in the Code:
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes an empty dictionary `freq` to store the frequencies of the pairs \((a_i \% x, a_i \% y)\) and a counter `beautiful_count` to count the beautiful pairs.
2. **Iteration through the array**: For each element `num` in the array `a`:
   - It calculates `mod_x` and `mod_y` which are `num % x` and `num % y` respectively.
   - It calculates `required_mod_x` which is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - It checks if the pair `(required_mod_x, mod_y)` exists in `freq`. If it does, it adds the frequency of this pair to `beautiful_count`.
   - It updates the frequency of the current pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` in `freq`.
3. **Result Collection**: After processing all elements in the array, it appends the count of beautiful pairs to the `results` list.

### Verification:
The logic in the code correctly identifies pairs that satisfy both conditions for being beautiful pairs. The use of modulo arithmetic ensures that the conditions are checked efficiently.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array according to the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
