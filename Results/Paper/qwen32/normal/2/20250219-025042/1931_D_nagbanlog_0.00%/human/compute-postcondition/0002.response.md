The code snippet assigns the values from the dictionary `case` to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The variable `a` is not mentioned in the code snippet, so its value remains unchanged. The variable `results` is still an empty list, and `t` retains its initial value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a) with 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `results` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from `case['params']`.**
