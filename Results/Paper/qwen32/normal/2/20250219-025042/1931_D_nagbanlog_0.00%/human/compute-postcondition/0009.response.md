The given code snippet only contains the line `mod_y = num % y`. However, there is no variable `num` defined in the initial state. Assuming that `num` is a typo and should be `x` (since `x` is mentioned in the initial state), the line would be `mod_y = x % y`.

Given this assumption, the variable `mod_y` is calculated as the remainder of `x` divided by `y`. The values of `x` and `y` are taken from `case['params']`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a) with 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `results` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0, `mod_x` is `y % x`, `mod_y` is `x % y`.**

In natural language: The variable `mod_y` is now set to the remainder of `x` divided by `y`. All other variables retain their initial values.
