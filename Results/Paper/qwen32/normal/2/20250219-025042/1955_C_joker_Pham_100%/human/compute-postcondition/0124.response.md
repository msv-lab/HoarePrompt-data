The code snippet provided decrements the variable `r` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `sunks`, and `k`) are not modified by this line of code.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `l` is less than or equal to `r`
- `sunks` is incremented by 1
- `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`

After executing `r -= 1`, the value of `r` is reduced by 1. The conditions and relationships between the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `l` is less than or equal to `r - 1`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`, `r` is decreased by 1**.
