The given code snippet modifies the value of `r` by decrementing it by 1. No other variables in the provided initial state are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a[r]` is less than the original `a[l]`, `l` is incremented by 1 if `a[l]` was 0, otherwise `l` remains unchanged, `r` is decremented by 1, `sunks` is incremented by 1, `k` is greater than or equal to the original `a[r] * 2` and `k` is now `k - a[r] * 2`. If `a[l]` was 0, then `a[l]` is set to 0.**
