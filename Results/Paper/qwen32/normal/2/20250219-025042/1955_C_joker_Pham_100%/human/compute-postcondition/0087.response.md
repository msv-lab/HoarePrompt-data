The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration of the loop. However, since there is no loop structure provided in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the flow of the program as described.

Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `r`, `sunks`) are altered by the `continue` statement. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `l` is less than or equal to `r` (with `r` decreased by 1), `sunks` is increased by 1.**
