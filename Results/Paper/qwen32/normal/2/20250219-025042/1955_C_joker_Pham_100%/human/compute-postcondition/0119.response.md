The code snippet `a[l] -= a[r]` modifies the value of `a[l]` by subtracting the value of `a[r]` from it. The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `r`, `k`, and `sunks` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `a[l]` will now hold its original value minus `a[r]`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`, `sunks` remains unchanged, `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`.**
