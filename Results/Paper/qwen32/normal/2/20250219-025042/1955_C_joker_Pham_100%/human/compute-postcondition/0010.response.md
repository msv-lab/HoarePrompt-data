Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is `n - 1`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, `sunks` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sunks` remains 0.**
