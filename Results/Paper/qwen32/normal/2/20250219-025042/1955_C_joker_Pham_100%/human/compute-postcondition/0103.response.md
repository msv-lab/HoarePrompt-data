The code snippet `a[r] -= a[l]` modifies the value of `a[r]` by subtracting the value of `a[l]` from it. The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `r`, `k`, and `sunks` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by the code.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `l` is less than or equal to `r`
- `k` is decreased by `a[l] * 2`
- If `l` equals `r`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and `sunks` remains unchanged

After executing `a[r] -= a[l]`, the value of `a[r]` is updated, but the other variables retain their initial conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `k` is decreased by `a[l] * 2`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - a[l]`, and `sunks` remains unchanged.**
