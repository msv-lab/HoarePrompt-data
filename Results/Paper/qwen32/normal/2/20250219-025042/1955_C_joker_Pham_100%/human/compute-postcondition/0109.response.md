Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `l` is less than or equal to `r` (but now `l` has been incremented by 1), `k` is decreased by `a[l] * 2`, `sunks` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The value of `l` has been incremented by 1, `k` has been decreased by `a[l] * 2`, and `sunks` has been incremented by 1. The condition that `l` is less than or equal to `r` still holds.
