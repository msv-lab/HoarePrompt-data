Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `a[l] <= a[r]`, then if `k >= a[l] * 2`, `l` is incremented by 1, `k` is decreased by `a[l] * 2`, `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[r]` becomes 0, `r` is also decremented by 1. If `k < a[l] * 2`, the conditions for breaking out of loops or if statements remain unchanged. Specifically, if `k` equals 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `l` equals `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Additionally, if `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `a[l] > a[r]`, the conditions for breaking out of loops or if statements remain unchanged as specified in the precondition.**
