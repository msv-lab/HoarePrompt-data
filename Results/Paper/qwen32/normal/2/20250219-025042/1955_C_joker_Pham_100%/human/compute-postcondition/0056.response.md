To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop statement. The loop condition is `l <= r`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5
- The values of `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` are modified based on specific conditions.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, the condition `l <= r` must hold true. Therefore, we need to adjust `l` and/or `r` such that this condition is satisfied.

### Analysis:
- If `l` is greater than `r`, the loop will terminate.
- To ensure the loop continues, we need to make sure that `l` is less than or equal to `r`.

### Adjustment:
- If at the end of the previous iteration `l` is greater than `r`, we need to adjust either `l` or `r` to ensure `l <= r`.
- Since we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head (`l` and `r`), we can either decrease `l` or increase `r` accordingly.

### Conclusion:
If `l` is greater than `r` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust `l` and/or `r` to ensure `l <= r`. If `l` is already less than or equal to `r`, no adjustment is needed.

### Example Adjustment:
- Suppose `l` is 5 and `r` is 4 at the end of the previous iteration. To ensure the loop executes one more time, we can set `l` to 4 (or any value less than or equal to `r`).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`**

This ensures that the condition `l <= r` holds true, allowing the loop to execute one more time.
