The function `func_1` takes an integer `n`, a large integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It performs operations to reduce `k` by subtracting twice the smallest element in the list or a combination of elements, while also modifying the list `a`. The function returns the total count of successful operations performed.
