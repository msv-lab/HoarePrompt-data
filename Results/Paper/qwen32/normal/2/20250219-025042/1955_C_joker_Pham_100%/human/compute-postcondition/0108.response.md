The value of `l` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `r`, `k`, and `sunks`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `l` is less than or equal to `r` (but now `l` has been incremented by 1), `k` is decreased by `a[l] * 2`, `sunks` is incremented by 1.**
