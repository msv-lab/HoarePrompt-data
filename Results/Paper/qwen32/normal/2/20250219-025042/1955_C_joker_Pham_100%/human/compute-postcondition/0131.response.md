Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `a[r] < a[l]`, then if `k >= a[r] * 2`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`, and `r` is decreased by 1, continuing to the next iteration of the loop. If `k < a[r] * 2`, the loop or if statement is broken out of if `k == a[r] * 2` or `k == 0`. If `k` is not 0 and `a[r] * 2 != k`, the behavior of `l`, `k`, and `sunks` depends on the conditions involving `a[l]` and `a[r]`: if `a[l] <= a[r]` and `k >= a[l] * 2`, then `l` is incremented by 1, `k` is decreased by `a[l] * 2`, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[l] <= a[r]` and `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and the loop or if statement is broken out of. If `a[l] <= a[r]` and `a[l] * 2 - 1 != k`, `sunks` remains unchanged, and the loop or if statement is broken out of. If `a[l] > a[r]`, the loop or if statement is broken out of, and `sunks` remains unchanged. If `a[r] >= a[l]`, none of the above conditions apply and the behavior is as specified in the else part, which is not provided.**
