To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to analyze the condition in the loop head:

```python
while l <= r:
    # the loop body is omit
```

Here, the loop will execute as long as `l` (left index) is less than or equal to `r` (right index).

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9
- `l` is 0
- `r` is `n - 1`
- `sunks` is 0

The only variables in the loop head are `l` and `r`. According to the code, the loop can execute if `l` is less than or equal to `r`.

Right before the loop:
- `l` is 0
- `r` is `n - 1`

Since `n` is at least 1 (as per the constraints), `r` will always be at least 0. Therefore, `l` (which is 0) will always be less than or equal to `r` (which is `n - 1`).

No adjustment is needed because the initial values of `l` and `r` already satisfy the condition `l <= r`.

Thus, the state remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is 0**
