Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `a[l]` was 0, then `l` is incremented by 1, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`. If `a[l]` was not 0, then `l` remains unchanged, `sunks` remains unchanged, and `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`.**
