The value of `r` is decremented by 1. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `k`, `a[r]`, `a[l]`, and `sunks`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `l` is less than or equal to `r - 1`, `k` is decreased by `a[l] * 2`, `a[r - 1]` is `a[r] - a[l]`, and `sunks` is incremented by 1.**
