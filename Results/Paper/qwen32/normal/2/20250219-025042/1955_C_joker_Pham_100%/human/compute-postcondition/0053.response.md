Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`. The values of `k`, `a`, `l`, `r` remain unchanged. Additionally, if `k` is equal to `a[r] * 2`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. In all cases, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
