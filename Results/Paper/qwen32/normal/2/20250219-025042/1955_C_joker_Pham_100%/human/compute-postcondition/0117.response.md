Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is not 0, the behavior of `l`, `k`, and `sunks` depends on the conditions involving `a[l]` and `a[r]`: if `a[l] <= a[r]` and `k >= a[l] * 2`, then `l` is incremented by 1, `k` is decreased by `a[l] * 2`, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[l] <= a[r]` and `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `a[l] <= a[r]` and `a[l] * 2 - 1 != k`, `sunks` remains unchanged, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `a[l] > a[r]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and `sunks` remains unchanged.**
