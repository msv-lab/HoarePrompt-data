Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `k` is decreased by `a[l] * 2`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - a[l]`, and `sunks` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `sunks` has been increased by 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `r`, `k`, and `a[r]`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
