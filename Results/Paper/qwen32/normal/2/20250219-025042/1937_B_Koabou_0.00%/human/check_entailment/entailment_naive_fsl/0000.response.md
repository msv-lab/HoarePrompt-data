Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all possible cases for finding the lexicographically smallest string and counting the number of paths that yield this string. Let's analyze the issues:

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Path Construction**:
   - The program attempts to construct the lexicographically smallest path by checking specific conditions and concatenating parts of the strings. However, it does not consider all possible paths and may miss the true lexicographically smallest path.
   - For example, in the second test case:
     ```
     4
     1101
     1100
     ```
     The program outputs `11000` and `1`, but the correct output should be `11000` and `2`. This is because there are two valid paths that yield `11000`:
       - Path 1: `1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 0 -> 0`
       - Path 2: `1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0`
   
2. **Incorrect Counting of Paths**:
   - The program incorrectly counts the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string. The counting logic is flawed and does not account for all valid paths.
   - In the above example, the program only considers one path (`1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 0 -> 0`) and fails to recognize the second valid path (`1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0`).

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
   - The program does not handle certain edge cases properly, such as when the grid consists entirely of `0`s or `1`s, or when there are multiple consecutive `0`s or `1`s in both rows.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
3
4
1101
1100
4
0011
0011
4
1111
0000
```
Expected Output:
```
11000
2
00110
2
00001
1
```
Actual Output from the Program:
```
11000
1
00110
1
00001
1
```
As seen in the counterexample, the program fails to correctly count the number of paths for the lexicographically smallest string in the first and second test cases.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to these issues.
