Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, the first and second lines contain binary strings of length n, `a` is a list containing the last two binary strings read by the loop, `s` is the concatenation of the substring of `a[0]` from the start to index `i + 1` and the substring of `a[1]` from index `i` to the end, `x` is set to `i`, and `i` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the variable `x` now holds the current value of `i`, and `i` has been increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
