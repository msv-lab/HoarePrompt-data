The function `func_1` processes a single test case consisting of two binary strings of equal length. It checks for a specific pattern where the next character in the top string is '1' and the current character in the bottom string is '0'. If such a pattern is found, it constructs a new string by concatenating the part of the top string up to that point with the rest of the bottom string starting from the current position. It also calculates a value `t` based on the position where this pattern was found. The function then prints the constructed string and the value `t`. If no such pattern is found, the behavior as per the given annotations is unclear, but based on the code, it defaults to printing the entire top string concatenated with the last character of the bottom string and `t` as 1.
