The code appends an input value to the list `a`. Since `a` was initially an empty list, after executing the code, `a` will contain one element which is the binary string input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, the first and second lines contain binary strings of length n, `a` is a list containing one binary string**.
