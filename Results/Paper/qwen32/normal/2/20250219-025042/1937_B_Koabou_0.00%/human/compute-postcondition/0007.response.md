The code appends a new binary string (obtained from `input()`) to the list `a`. Since `a` initially contains two binary strings, after appending one more string, `a` will contain three binary strings.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, the first and second lines contain binary strings of length n, `a` is a list containing three binary strings.**
