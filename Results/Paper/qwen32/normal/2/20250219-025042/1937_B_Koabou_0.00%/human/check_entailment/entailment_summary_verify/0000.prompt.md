You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is
\mathtt{11000} . There is only one path that yields this string:

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
    s = []
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
    else:
        s = a[0] + a[1][n - 1]
        x = n - 1
    t = 1
    for i in range(x):
        if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
    print(s, sep='')
    print(t)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a single test case consisting of two binary strings of equal length. It checks for a specific pattern where the next character in the top string is '1' and the current character in the bottom string is '0'. If such a pattern is found, it constructs a new string by concatenating the part of the top string up to that point with the rest of the bottom string starting from the current position. It also calculates a value `t` based on the position where this pattern was found. The function then prints the constructed string and the value `t`. If no such pattern is found, the behavior as per the given annotations is unclear, but based on the code, it defaults to printing the entire top string concatenated with the last character of the bottom string and `t` as 1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all possible cases for finding the lexicographically smallest string and counting the number of paths that yield this string. Let's analyze the issues:

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Path Construction**:
   - The program attempts to construct the lexicographically smallest path by checking specific conditions and concatenating parts of the strings. However, it does not consider all possible paths and may miss the true lexicographically smallest path.
   - For example, in the second test case:
     ```
     4
     1101
     1100
     ```
     The program outputs `11000` and `1`, but the correct output should be `11000` and `2`. This is because there are two valid paths that yield `11000`:
       - Path 1: `1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 0 -> 0`
       - Path 2: `1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0`
   
2. **Incorrect Counting of Paths**:
   - The program incorrectly counts the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string. The counting logic is flawed and does not account for all valid paths.
   - In the above example, the program only considers one path (`1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 0 -> 0`) and fails to recognize the second valid path (`1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0`).

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
   - The program does not handle certain edge cases properly, such as when the grid consists entirely of `0`s or `1`s, or when there are multiple consecutive `0`s or `1`s in both rows.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
3
4
1101
1100
4
0011
0011
4
1111
0000
```
Expected Output:
```
11000
2
00110
2
00001
1
```
Actual Output from the Program:
```
11000
1
00110
1
00001
1
```
As seen in the counterexample, the program fails to correctly count the number of paths for the lexicographically smallest string in the first and second test cases.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to these issues.
