Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is
\mathtt{11000} . There is only one path that yields this string:

# Annotated Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), the second and third lines contain binary strings of length n, representing the top and bottom rows of the 2 × n grid respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 from the last test case, the first and second lines contain binary strings of length n from the last test case, `a` is a list containing the last two binary strings read by the loop.
    s = []
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, the first and second lines contain binary strings of length n, a is a list containing the last two binary strings read by the loop, s is a list containing the concatenation of a[0] and the last character of a[1], x is n - 1.
    t = 1
    for i in range(x):
        if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: t is 1, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, the first and second lines contain binary strings of length n, a is a list containing the last two binary strings read by the loop, s is a list containing the concatenation of a[0] and the last character of a[1], and x is n - 1.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: binary_string1 followed by the last character of binary_string2 (where binary_string1 and binary_string2 are the binary strings of length n provided in the input)
    print(t)
    #This is printed: 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a single test case consisting of two binary strings of equal length. It checks for a specific pattern where the next character in the top string is '1' and the current character in the bottom string is '0'. If such a pattern is found, it constructs a new string by concatenating the part of the top string up to that point with the rest of the bottom string starting from the current position. It also calculates a value `t` based on the position where this pattern was found. The function then prints the constructed string and the value `t`. If no such pattern is found, the behavior as per the given annotations is unclear, but based on the code, it defaults to printing the entire top string concatenated with the last character of the bottom string and `t` as 1.
