Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, the first and second lines contain binary strings of length n, `a` is a list containing the last two binary strings read by the loop, `s` is a list containing the concatenation of the substring of `a[0]` from the start to index `i + 1` and the substring of `a[1]` from index `i` to the end, `x` is `i`, and at the current index `i`, `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
