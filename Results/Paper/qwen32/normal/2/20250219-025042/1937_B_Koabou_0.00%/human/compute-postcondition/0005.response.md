The given code appends a new binary string (from the input) to the list `a`. The initial state specifies that `a` already contains one binary string. After executing the code, `a` will now contain two binary strings.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, the first and second lines contain binary strings of length n, `a` is a list containing two binary strings**.
