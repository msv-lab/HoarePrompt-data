Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 from the last test case, the first and second lines contain binary strings of length n from the last test case, `a` is a list containing the last two binary strings read by the loop, `s` is an empty list, `x` is 0.**

In natural language: The variable `x` has been assigned the value 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `s`) retain their initial values.
