The provided code snippet initializes an empty list `a`. This action does not affect any other variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), the second and third lines contain binary strings of length n, representing the top and bottom rows of the 2 × n grid respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. `a` is an empty list.**
