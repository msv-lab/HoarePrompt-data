Postcondition: **`t` is `n - i` if the substring of `a[0]` from the start to index `i + 1` is equal to the substring of `s` from the start to index `i + 1`. `n` remains an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, the first and second lines contain binary strings of length n, `a` is a list containing the last two binary strings read by the loop, `s` is a list containing the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]`, and `x` is `n - 1` and must be greater than 0. If the substrings are not equal, the control does not change as there is no else part.**
