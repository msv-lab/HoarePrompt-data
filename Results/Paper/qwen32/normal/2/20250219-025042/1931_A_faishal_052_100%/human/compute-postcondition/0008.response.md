Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `arr` is a list containing the integer 1, `lex` is an input integer with a value less than 28 and now `lex` is `lex - 1`.**

Natural Language: The value of `lex` has been decremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
