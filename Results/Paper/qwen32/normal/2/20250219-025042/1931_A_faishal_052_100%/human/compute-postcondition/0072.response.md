The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted:

- `j` is currently 1, and it needs to be incremented to 2 for the loop to execute one more time.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `cases`, `info`, `i`, `lex`, `arr`) are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr`, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is 2**
