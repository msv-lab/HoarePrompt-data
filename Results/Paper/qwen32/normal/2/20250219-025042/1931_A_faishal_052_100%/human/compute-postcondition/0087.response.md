The code snippet provided resets the `arr` list to an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr` and then the new `arr`, `i` is `i + 2`, `j` is 2, `arr` is `[]`.**

In natural language: The variable `arr` is now an empty list. All other variables retain their previous values.
