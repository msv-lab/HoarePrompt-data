Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr` and then the new `arr` with `lex` appended, and now also contains the sorted `arr`, `i` is `i + 2`, `j` is 2, `arr` is sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that `info` now includes the sorted `arr` appended to it. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
