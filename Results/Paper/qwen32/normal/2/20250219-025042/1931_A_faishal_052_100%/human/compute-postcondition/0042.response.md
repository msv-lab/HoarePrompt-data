The given code snippet sorts the list `arr`. Since `arr` contains up to two elements, sorting it will simply ensure that if there are two elements, they are in non-decreasing order. The values of `t`, `n`, `cases`, `info`, and `lex` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex`, `arr` contains up to two elements in non-decreasing order, and `lex` is reduced by up to 52.**
