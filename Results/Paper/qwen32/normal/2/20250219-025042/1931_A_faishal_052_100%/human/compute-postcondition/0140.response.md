The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `cases`. If `i` is less than `cases`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. The value of `cases` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue executing.

The states `info`, `temp`, and `j` are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged.

State: **`info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`; `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to `info[i][0] + 96`, `info[i][1] + 96`, and `info[i][2] + 96`; `j` is 2; `i` is 3, `cases` must be greater than 3**
