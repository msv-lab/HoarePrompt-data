The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `info`. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `cases`, which remain as described in the initial state.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78; cases is an input integer; `info` is an empty list.**
