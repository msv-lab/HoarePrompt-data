The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the loop statement `for j in range(2):`, the loop will iterate as long as `j` is less than 2. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, but since the range is up to 2 (non-inclusive), the loop will terminate after `j` becomes 2.

However, since the task is to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we should consider the state right before the loop condition is checked again. Therefore, `j` should be incremented from 1 to 2, but the loop will not execute again because `j` will no longer be less than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `j` is 2**
