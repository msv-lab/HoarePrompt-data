Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr`, `lex` is an integer, `i` is `i + 1`. If `lex` was initially less than 28, `lex` is now `lex - 1` and `arr` is [1, 26]. If `lex` was initially greater than or equal to 26 but less than or equal to 52, `arr` is [26, 26]. If `lex` was initially greater than 78, `arr` is [26], `j` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `arr` is updated by appending 26 to it. The values of `t`, `n`, `cases`, `lex`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states, except for `arr` which now includes the additional element 26.
