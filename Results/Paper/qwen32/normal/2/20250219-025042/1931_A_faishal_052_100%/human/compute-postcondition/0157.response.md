The code snippet concatenates a new character to the existing string `temp`. This new character is derived from the ASCII value of `info[i][j] + 96`.

Given the initial state:
- `info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`.
- `temp` is initially set to `chr(info[4][2] + 96) + chr(info[4][3] + 96)`.
- `j` is 3.
- `i` is 4.
- `cases` must be greater than 4.

After executing the line `temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)`, the value of `temp` is updated to include the additional character `chr(info[4][3] + 96)`.

Therefore, the new value of `temp` will be `chr(info[4][2] + 96) + chr(info[4][3] + 96) + chr(info[4][3] + 96)`, which simplifies to `chr(info[4][2] + 96) + 2 * chr(info[4][3] + 96)`.

Since no other variables are modified, the output state remains the same for `info`, `j`, `i`, and `cases`.

Output State: **`info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`; `temp` is `chr(info[4][2] + 96) + 2 * chr(info[4][3] + 96)`; `j` is 3; `i` is 4; `cases` must be greater than 4.**
