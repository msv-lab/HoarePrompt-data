Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr`, `lex` is an input integer, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex < 28:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    elif lex <= 78:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr`, `lex` is an integer, `i` is `i + 1`. If `lex` was initially less than 28, `lex` is now `lex - 1` and `arr` is [1]. If `lex` was initially greater than or equal to 26 but less than or equal to 52, `arr` is [26]. If `lex` was initially greater than 78, `arr` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr`, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is 1. If `lex` was initially less than 28, `lex` is now `lex - 1` and `arr` is [1, 1] if `lex < 26`, otherwise `arr` is [26, 1]. If `lex` was initially between 26 and 52, `arr` is [26, 26] if `lex < 52`, otherwise `arr` is [1, 26] if `lex - 26` is in the range -25 to 1, [26, 26] if `lex - 26` is in the range 0 to 26, and [26] if `lex - 26` is greater than 52. If `lex` was initially greater than 52 but less than or equal to 78, `arr` is [1, 26] if `lex - 26` is in the range -25 to 1, [26, 26] if `lex - 26` is in the range 0 to 26, and [26] if `lex - 26` is greater than 52. If `lex` was initially greater than 78, `arr` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr`, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is 2. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` has an additional element `1` appended to it and `lex` is `lex - 1`. If `lex` is 28 or greater but less than 52, `arr` has an additional element `26` appended to it and `lex` is `lex - 26`. If `lex` is 52 or greater but less than or equal to 78, `arr` has an additional element `26` appended to it and `lex` is `lex - 26`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
