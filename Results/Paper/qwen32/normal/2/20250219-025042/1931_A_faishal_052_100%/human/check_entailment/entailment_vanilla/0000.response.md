Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` which represents the encoded value of the word.

2. **Logic for Finding the Lexicographically Smallest Word:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the values corresponding to the letters of the word.
   - It then enters a loop that runs twice (for the first two letters).
     - If `lex` is less than 28, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`. This is incorrect because it should always try to minimize the value of the first letters to ensure the word is lexicographically smallest.
     - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This is also incorrect for the same reason.
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 78, it again appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This logic does not guarantee the smallest possible letters.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - The list `arr` is then sorted, which is unnecessary and incorrect because we need to ensure the first letters are minimized first, not just sort the final values.

3. **Generating the Output:**
   - The program converts each value in `arr` to a character by adding 96 (which corresponds to 'a' being 1) and concatenates them to form the word.
   - It prints the resulting word for each test case.

### Issues Identified:
- The logic for determining the first two letters is flawed. It doesn't ensure that the letters are the smallest possible while still allowing the third letter to make up the required sum.
- Sorting the list after determining the values does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word.

### Correct Approach:
- To find the lexicographically smallest word, we should start by assigning the smallest possible values to the first two letters and then calculate the third letter.
- We can iterate over possible values for the first letter, then the second letter, and compute the third letter accordingly, ensuring all values are between 1 and 26.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the logic, the program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for each encoded value.

Correctness: **False**
