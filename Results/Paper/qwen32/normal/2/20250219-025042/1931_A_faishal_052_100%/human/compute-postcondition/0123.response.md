Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr` and then the new `arr`, `i` is `i + 2`, `j` is 2. If `lex` was initially less than 28, `arr` has an additional element `1` appended to it and `lex` is decreased by `1`. If `lex` was initially between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` has `26` appended to it and `lex` is decreased by `26`. If `lex` was initially between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` has `26` appended to it and `lex` is decreased by `26`. If `lex` was initially greater than 78, `arr` remains unchanged and `lex` remains unchanged.**
