Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `j` is 2. If `lex` was initially less than 52, `lex` is reduced by 26 and `arr` contains the element 26. If `lex` was initially 52 or more but less than or equal to 78, `arr` contains the element 26.**
