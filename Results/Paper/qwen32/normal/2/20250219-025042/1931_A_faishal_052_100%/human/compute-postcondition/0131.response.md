The code snippet provided initializes a variable `temp` with an empty string. This action does not affect the existing variables `info`, `cases`, or any of the arrays within `info`. Therefore, the only change is the initialization of `temp`.

Output State: **`info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`, where each `arr` is constructed based on the input `lex` values read during each iteration of the loop, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1; `temp` is an empty string.**
