To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the given for loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for j in range(3):`. This means the only variable we can adjust directly is `j`.

Here's the analysis:

- The loop will iterate over the range from 0 to 2 (inclusive), meaning `j` will take values 0, 1, and 2.
- The initial value of `j` before the loop starts is not explicitly mentioned, but for the loop to begin executing, `j` should be set to the starting value of the range, which is 0.

The variables `info`, `cases`, and `temp` are not part of the loop head, so they cannot be directly adjusted to influence the loop's execution. However, we can describe their states as they are given in the problem statement.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted such that `j` is set to 0.

State: **`info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`, where each `arr` is constructed based on the input `lex` values read during each iteration of the loop, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1; `temp` is an empty string; `j` is 0**
