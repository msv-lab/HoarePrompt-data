The code appends the value `26` to the list `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr`, `lex` is an input integer and its value is greater than or equal to 52 but less than or equal to 78, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr` is [26]**
