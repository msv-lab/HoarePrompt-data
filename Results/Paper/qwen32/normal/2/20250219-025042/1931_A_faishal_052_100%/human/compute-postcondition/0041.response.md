The code appends the current value of `lex` to the list `info`. Since `info` was initially an empty list, after the operation, `info` will contain one element, which is the value of `lex`. The values of `t`, `n`, `cases`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex`, `arr` contains up to two elements based on the initial value of `lex`, and `lex` is reduced by up to 52.**
