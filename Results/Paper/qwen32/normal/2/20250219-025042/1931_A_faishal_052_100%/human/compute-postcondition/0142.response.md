The only variable in the loop head is `j`, as it is the iterating variable in the `range(3)` function. The loop will execute if `j` takes on values from 0 to 2. 

Given the initial state where `j` is 2, the loop will execute because the loop iterates from 0 to 2 inclusive. However, to ensure the loop starts correctly from the beginning, `j` should be initialized to 0.

The other variables (`info`, `temp`, `i`, `cases`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted according to the instructions.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `j` is 0.

State: **`info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`; `temp` is an empty string; `j` is 0; `i` is 3, `cases` must be greater than 3**
