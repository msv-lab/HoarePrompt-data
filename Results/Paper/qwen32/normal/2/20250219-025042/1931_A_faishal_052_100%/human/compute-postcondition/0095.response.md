The code appends the value `26` to the list `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr` and then the new `arr`, `i` is `i + 2`, `j` is 0, `arr` is `[26]`, `lex` is an input integer, `lex` is greater than or equal to 28, and `lex` is less than 52.**
