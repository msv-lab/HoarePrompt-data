To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code step-by-step:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `t`: An integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1 (inclusive).
   - `n`: An integer input by the user, and it must be greater than 1.
   - `x`: A list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500.
   - `T`: A list of integers derived from the string `line` split and converted to integers.
   - `a`: A reversed list constructed as follows:
     - Start with the number 1000.
     - Subtract the first element of `T` from 1000 to get the next element.
     - Continue subtracting subsequent elements of `T` from the previous result to get the next elements.
     - Finally, subtract the cumulative sum of all elements in `T` from 1000 to get the last element.
   - `result`: A string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`.

2. **Constructing the list `a`:**
   - Let's denote the elements of `T` as `T[0], T[1], ..., T[n-2]`.
   - The list `a` is constructed as:
     - `a[0] = 1000`
     - `a[1] = 1000 - T[0]`
     - `a[2] = 1000 - T[0] - T[1]`
     - ...
     - `a[n-1] = 1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2])`
   - This list is then reversed.

3. **Forming the `result` string:**
   - The `result` string is formed by joining the elements of the reversed list `a` with spaces.

Given this information, the `print(result)` statement will output the space-separated string of the reversed list `a`.

**Output Description:**
The output will be a space-separated string of integers starting from `1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2])` up to `1000`, where each integer is the result of subtracting the cumulative sum of the elements of `T` from 1000, in reverse order.

Output: **result (where result is the space-separated string of the reversed list `a`)**
