Let's break down the given initial state and determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `t`: At least 0 (not used directly in the print statement).
   - `n`: An input integer greater than 1.
   - `x`: A list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies `1 <= x_i <= 500` (not used directly in the print statement).
   - `T`: A list of integers derived from a new input string `line` split and converted to integers.
   - `a`: A list constructed as follows:
     - For each index `i` from `0` to `n-2`, the element at position `i` in `a` is `(1000 - sum(T[:i+1]))`.
     - The last element of `a` is `1000`.
   - `result`: A string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`.
   - `line`: A new input string provided by the user.
   - `i`: Set to `n-1` (not used directly in the print statement).

2. **Construction of List `a`:**
   - `a` is constructed based on the cumulative sums of the first `i+1` elements of `T` up to `n-1` elements.
   - Each element of `a` except the last one is calculated as `1000 - sum(T[:i+1])`.
   - The last element of `a` is always `1000`.

### Deriving the Output:

Given the construction of `a`:
- The first element of `a` is `1000 - T[0]`.
- The second element of `a` is `1000 - (T[0] + T[1])`.
- This pattern continues until the second-to-last element of `a`, which is `1000 - sum(T[:n-1])`.
- The last element of `a` is `1000`.

The `result` string is simply the space-separated concatenation of these elements.

### Example Calculation:

Assume `n = 4` and `T = [200, 150, 100]`:
- `a[0] = 1000 - T[0] = 1000 - 200 = 800`
- `a[1] = 1000 - (T[0] + T[1]) = 1000 - (200 + 150) = 650`
- `a[2] = 1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + T[2]) = 1000 - (200 + 150 + 100) = 550`
- `a[3] = 1000`

Thus, `a = [800, 650, 550, 1000]` and `result = "800 650 550 1000"`.

### General Case:

Without specific values for `T` and `n`, we can describe the output in terms of the constructed list `a`.

### Final Output:

Output: **result (where result is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of the list `a`, constructed as `[1000 - sum(T[:1]), 1000 - sum(T[:2]), ..., 1000 - sum(T[:n-1]), 1000]`)**
