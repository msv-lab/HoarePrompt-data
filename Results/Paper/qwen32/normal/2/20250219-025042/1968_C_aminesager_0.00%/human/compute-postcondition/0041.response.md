The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on these two variables. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `1` (since the loop starts from `1`), and `n` is an input integer greater than `1`. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by `1`.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `2` and `n` remains the same (an input integer greater than `1`).

State: **`t` is at least 0; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies `1 <= x_i <= 500`; `T` is a list of integers derived from the new input string `line` split and converted to integers; `a` is `[1000, 1000 - T[i - 1]]`; `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`; `line` is the new input string provided by the user; `i` is 2**
