The given code appends a new value to the list `a`. This new value is calculated as `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1.
- `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1.
- `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500.
- `T` is a list of integers derived from the string `line` split and converted to integers.
- `a` is initially `[1000, 1000 - T[0], a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]]`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

After executing the line `a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])`, the list `a` will have an additional element at the end which is the result of `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500; `T` is a list of integers derived from the string `line` split and converted to integers; `a` is `[1000, 1000 - T[0], a[1] - T[1], ..., a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]]`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
