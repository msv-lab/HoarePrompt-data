Output State: **`t` is at least 0; `n` must be greater than 1; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies `1 <= x_i <= 500`; `T` is a list of integers derived from the string `line` split and converted to integers; `a` is `[(1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2])), ..., (1000 - T[0] - T[1]), (1000 - T[0]), 1000]`; `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`; `line` is the new input string provided by the user.**

Explanation: The value of `t` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
