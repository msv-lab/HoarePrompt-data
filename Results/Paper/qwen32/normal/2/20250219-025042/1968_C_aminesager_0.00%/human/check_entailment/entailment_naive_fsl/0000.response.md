Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate the array `a` such that `a_i mod a_(i-1) = x_i` for all `2 <= i <= n`. Let's analyze why:

1. **Initialization of `a`:** The array `a` is initialized with `[1000]`, which is arbitrary and does not guarantee the required properties.
2. **Generating `a`:** The loop `for i in range(1, n): a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])` attempts to build the array `a` but uses subtraction instead of addition or another valid method to ensure the modulo condition is met.
3. **Reversing `a`:** The array `a` is reversed before being printed, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

Let's consider a simple counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 1
```

**Expected Output:** An array `a` such that `a_2 mod a_1 = 1` and `a_3 mod a_2 = 1`. One possible solution is `a = [2, 3, 4]`.

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
899 999
```

Explanation of the actual output:
- `a[0]` is initialized to `1000`.
- `a[1]` is calculated as `a[0] - T[0] = 1000 - 1 = 999`.
- `a[2]` is calculated as `a[1] - T[1] = 999 - 1 = 998`.
- The array is then reversed, resulting in `[998, 999]`.

This output does not satisfy the conditions:
- `999 mod 1000 != 1`
- `998 mod 999 != 1`

Thus, the program is incorrect.
