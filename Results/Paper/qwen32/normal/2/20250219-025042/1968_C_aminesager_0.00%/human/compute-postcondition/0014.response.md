The code snippet reverses the list `a`. Given the initial state, `a` is a list where each element is calculated as `1000` minus the cumulative sum of elements from `T` up to that point. After reversing `a`, the first element of the original `a` becomes the last element of the new `a`, and so on.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500; `T` is a list of integers derived from the string `line` split and converted to integers; `a` is the reversed list of `[1000, 1000 - T[0], 1000 - T[0] - T[1], ..., 1000 - sum(T)]`.**
