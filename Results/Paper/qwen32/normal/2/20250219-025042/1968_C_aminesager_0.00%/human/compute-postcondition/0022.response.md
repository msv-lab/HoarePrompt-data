The code snippet `a = [1000]` reassigns the variable `a` to a new list containing only the integer `1000`. This means the previous value of `a` (which was a reversed list of calculated differences) is overwritten.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the new integer input by the user and must be greater than 1; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500; `T` is a list of integers derived from the string `line` split and converted to integers; `a` is `[1000]`; `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`; `line` is the new input string provided by the user.**
