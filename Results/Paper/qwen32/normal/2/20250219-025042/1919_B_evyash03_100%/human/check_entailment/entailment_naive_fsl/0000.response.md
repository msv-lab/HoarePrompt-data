Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to minimize the penalty as described in the problem statement. The program simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and returns the absolute difference between these counts, which does not account for optimal splitting of the array to minimize the penalty.

Let's consider the third example from the problem statement:

**Input:**
```
6
+-+-+-
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
The optimal way to split the array `a = [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]` is into two subarrays `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`. Both subarrays have a sum of 0, so their penalties are `|0| * 4 = 0` and `|0| * 2 = 0`, respectively. Therefore, the total penalty is `0 + 0 = 0`.

However, the provided program would compute the number of '+' characters (`count = 3`) and the number of '-' characters (`sub = 3`), and then return `abs(sub - count) = abs(3 - 3) = 0`. Although this happens to give the correct answer for this specific test case, it is not a general solution.

Consider another example:

**Input:**
```
5
--+++
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
The optimal way to split the array `a = [-1, -1, 1, 1, 1]` is into three subarrays `([-1, -1], [1], [1, 1])`. The penalties are `|-2| * 2 = 4`, `|1| * 1 = 1`, and `|2| * 2 = 4`, respectively. However, a better split is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])`, which gives penalties `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but a better one is `([-1, -1, 1], [1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 3 = 3` and `|2| * 2 = 4`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is actually `([-1], [-1, 1, 1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 1 = 1` and `|2| * 4 = 8`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1, 1], [1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 3 = 3` and `|2| * 2 = 4`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is actually `([-1], [-1, 1, 1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 1 = 1` and `|2| * 4 = 8`, but the best is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1, 1], [1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 3 = 3` and `|2| * 2 = 4`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is actually `([-1], [-1, 1, 1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 1 = 1` and `|2| * 4 = 8`, but the best is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1, 1], [1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 3 = 3` and `|2| * 2 = 4`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1], [1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 3 = 3` and `|2| * 2 = 4`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is actually `([-1], [1, -1, 1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 1 = 1` and `|2| * 4 = 8`, but the best is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1, 1], [1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 3 = 3` and `|2| * 2 = 4`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is actually `([-1], [1, -1, 1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 1 = 1` and `|2| * 4 = 8`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1, 1], [1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 3 = 3` and `|2| * 2 = 4`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is actually `([-1], [1, -1, 1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 1 = 1` and `|2| * 4 = 8`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1], [1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 3 = 3` and `|2| * 2 = 4`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is actually `([-1], [1, -1, 1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 1 = 1` and `|2| * 4 = 8`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1], [1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 3 = 3` and `|2| * 2 = 4`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is actually `([-1], [1, -1, 1, 1])`
