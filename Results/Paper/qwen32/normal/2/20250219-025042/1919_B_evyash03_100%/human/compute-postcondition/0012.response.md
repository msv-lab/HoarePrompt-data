The code assigns the value of `length - count` to the variable `sub`. Given that `count` is the number of '+' characters in the expression string, and `length` is presumably the total number of characters in the expression string, `sub` will represent the number of characters in the expression string excluding the '+' characters.

Output State: **count is equal to the number of '+' characters in the expression string; `sub` is equal to `length - count`.**
