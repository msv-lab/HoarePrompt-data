Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` simply calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, which does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.

To solve this problem optimally, one would need to consider different ways to split the array and calculate the penalty for each split, aiming to minimize the total penalty. This typically involves dynamic programming or a greedy approach to efficiently find the optimal solution. The current implementation does not address these aspects and thus is incorrect.
