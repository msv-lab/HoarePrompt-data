### Reasoning:

The given program calculates the minimum penalty based on the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string. However, this approach does not align with the problem's requirements. Let's break down why:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to split the array into subarrays such that the sum of penalties of these subarrays is minimized.
   - Penalty of a subarray is defined as the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length.
   - The optimal strategy involves finding a way to balance the sums of the subarrays to minimize the penalties.

2. **Given Program Analysis:**
   - The program counts the number of '+' characters (`count`) and calculates the number of '-' characters (`sub = length - count`).
   - It then returns the absolute difference `abs(sub - count)`, which is equivalent to `abs(length - 2 * count)`.

3. **Why This Approach is Incorrect:**
   - The provided formula does not consider how the array should be split to minimize the penalties.
   - It simply computes a difference based on the counts of '+' and '-', which does not guarantee an optimal split.
   - For example, in the third test case (`+-+-+-`), the optimal split would be `([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1])`, resulting in a penalty of `0`. However, the program would return `abs(6 - 2*3) = 0`, which is coincidentally correct but not because of the logic used.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - A correct solution would involve dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to find the optimal way to split the array.
   - The idea is to try to balance the sums of the subarrays as much as possible to minimize the penalties.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem optimally. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
