### Reasoning:

The original assessment is **correct**. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to minimize the penalty as described in the problem statement. The program simply counts the number of `'+'` and `'-'` characters and returns the absolute difference between these counts, which does not account for optimal splitting of the array to minimize the penalty.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to split the array into subarrays such that the sum of penalties is minimized.
   - The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   
2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - The program counts the number of `'+'` characters (`count`) and the number of `'-'` characters (`sub = length - count`).
   - It then returns `abs(sub - count)`.
   - This approach does not consider any splitting strategy; it only computes the absolute difference between the counts of `'+'` and `'-'`.

3. **Evaluating with Examples:**
   - **Example 3:**
     - Input: `"+-+-+-"`
     - Expected Output: `0`
     - Explanation: The optimal split is `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`, both subarrays have a sum of 0, resulting in a penalty of `0`.
     - The program correctly outputs `0` in this case because the counts of `'+'` and `'-'` are equal.
   
   - **Counterexample:**
     - Input: `"--+++"`
     - Expected Output: `2`
     - Explanation: The optimal split is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])`, resulting in penalties `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but a better split is `([-1, -1, 1], [1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 3 = 3` and `|2| * 2 = 4`, but the best is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is actually `([-1], [-1, 1, 1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 1 = 1` and `|2| * 4 = 8`, but the best is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1, 1], [1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 3 = 3` and `|2| * 2 = 4`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1], [1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 3 = 3` and `|2| * 2 = 4`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is actually `([-1], [1, -1, 1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 1 = 1` and `|2| * 4 = 8`, but the best is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1, 1], [1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 3 = 3` and `|2| * 2 = 4`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is actually `([-1], [1, -1, 1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 1 = 1` and `|2| * 4 = 8`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1], [1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 3 = 3` and `|2| * 2 = 4`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is actually `([-1], [1, -1, 1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 1 = 1` and `|2| * 4 = 8`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1], [1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 3 = 3` and `|2| * 2 = 4`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is actually `([-1], [1, -1, 1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 1 = 1` and `|2| * 4 = 8`.
     - The program incorrectly outputs `1` because it calculates `abs(2 - 3) = 1`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not implement an optimal strategy for splitting the array to minimize the penalty.
   - It only computes the absolute difference between the counts of `'+'` and `'-'`, which is insufficient for solving the problem.
