Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. Convert the string `s` into an array `a` where each '+' is 1 and each '-' is -1.
2. Split this array into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k`.
3. Calculate the penalty for each subarray `b_i` as `|sum(b_i)| * len(b_i)`.
4. Find the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the length of the string and the string itself. It then calls `func_1` with these parameters.

#### Function `func_1`:
- It counts the number of '+' characters in the string.
- It calculates the number of '-' characters by subtracting the count of '+' from the length of the string.
- It returns the absolute difference between the count of '+' and '-'.

#### Issues in the Program:
- The function `func_1` does not actually split the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty. Instead, it just calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the entire string.
- This approach does not consider any splitting strategy and thus does not guarantee the minimum penalty as required by the problem.

### Correctness:
Given the analysis, the program does not implement the required logic to solve the problem correctly. It fails to find the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
