Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `expression`, which is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters, and a parameter `length`, which is an integer representing the length of the `expression` (with 1 <= length <= 5000). The function returns the absolute value of the difference between `length` and twice the count of '+' characters in the `expression`.**
