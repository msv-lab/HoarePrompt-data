To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider how the loop processes each character in the `expression` string. The loop iterates over each character in the string `expression`, and if the character is '+', it increments the `count` variable by 1. If the character is '-', the `count` remains unchanged.

Given the loop's behavior, the final value of `count` will be equal to the number of '+' characters in the `expression` string. Since the length of `expression` can be up to 5000 characters, the `count` could range from 0 (if there are no '+' characters) to 5000 (if all characters are '+').

Here's the final output state:

Output State: **count is equal to the number of '+' characters in the expression string.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has processed every character in the `expression` string, the `count` variable will hold the total number of '+' characters found in the string. The `expression` string and its length remain unchanged, as they are not modified within the loop.
