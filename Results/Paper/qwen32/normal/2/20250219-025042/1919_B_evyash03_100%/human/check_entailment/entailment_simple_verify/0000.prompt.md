You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-". s
represents an array a of length n defined by a_i=1 if s_i= "+" and a_i=-1 if
s_i= "-".

You will do the following process to calculate your penalty:

  1. Split a into non-empty arrays b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k such that b_1+b_2+\ldots+b_k=a^\dagger , where + denotes array concatenation. 
  2. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. In other words, for some array c of length m , its penalty is calculated as p(c)=|c_1+c_2+\ldots+c_m| \cdot m . 
  3. The total penalty that you will receive is p(b_1)+p(b_2)+\ldots+p(b_k) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger Some valid ways to split a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k) are
([3],[1],[4],[1],[5]) , ([3,1],[4,1,5]) and ([3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,1],[1,5]) , ([3],[\,],[1,4],[1,5]) and ([3,4],[5,1,1])
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the length of string s .

The second line of each test case contains string s (s_i \in \\{ \mathtt{+},
\mathtt{-} \\} , |s| = n ).

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

Note

In the first test case, we have a=[1] . We can split array a into ([1]) .
Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is p([1]) = 1 .

In the second test case, we have a=[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] . We can split array a
into ([-1],[-1],[-1],[-1],[-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays
is p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 .

In the third test case, we have a=[1,-1,1,-1,1,-1] . We can split array a into
([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is
p([1,-1,1,-1]) + p([1,-1]) = 0 + 0 = 0 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    length = int(input())
    expression = input().strip()
    print(func_1(expression, length))

def func_1(expression, length):
    count = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            count += 1
    sub = length - count
    return abs(sub - count)



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    length = int(input())
    expression = input().strip()
    print(func_1(expression, length))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters, and length is an integer such that length = len(expression) and 1 <= length <= 5000.
def func_1(expression, length):
    count = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            count += 1
        
    #State: count is equal to the number of '+' characters in the expression string.
    sub = length - count
    return abs(sub - count)
    #The program returns the absolute value of (length - 2 * count)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to minimize the penalty as described in the problem statement. The program simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and returns the absolute difference between these counts, which does not account for optimal splitting of the array to minimize the penalty.

Let's consider the third example from the problem statement:

**Input:**
```
6
+-+-+-
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
The optimal way to split the array `a = [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]` is into two subarrays `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`. Both subarrays have a sum of 0, so their penalties are `|0| * 4 = 0` and `|0| * 2 = 0`, respectively. Therefore, the total penalty is `0 + 0 = 0`.

However, the provided program would compute the number of '+' characters (`count = 3`) and the number of '-' characters (`sub = 3`), and then return `abs(sub - count) = abs(3 - 3) = 0`. Although this happens to give the correct answer for this specific test case, it is not a general solution.

Consider another example:

**Input:**
```
5
--+++
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
The optimal way to split the array `a = [-1, -1, 1, 1, 1]` is into three subarrays `([-1, -1], [1], [1, 1])`. The penalties are `|-2| * 2 = 4`, `|1| * 1 = 1`, and `|2| * 2 = 4`, respectively. However, a better split is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])`, which gives penalties `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but a better one is `([-1, -1, 1], [1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 3 = 3` and `|2| * 2 = 4`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is actually `([-1], [-1, 1, 1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 1 = 1` and `|2| * 4 = 8`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1, 1], [1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 3 = 3` and `|2| * 2 = 4`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is actually `([-1], [-1, 1, 1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 1 = 1` and `|2| * 4 = 8`, but the best is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1, 1], [1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 3 = 3` and `|2| * 2 = 4`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is actually `([-1], [-1, 1, 1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 1 = 1` and `|2| * 4 = 8`, but the best is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1, 1], [1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 3 = 3` and `|2| * 2 = 4`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1], [1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 3 = 3` and `|2| * 2 = 4`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is actually `([-1], [1, -1, 1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 1 = 1` and `|2| * 4 = 8`, but the best is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1, 1], [1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 3 = 3` and `|2| * 2 = 4`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is actually `([-1], [1, -1, 1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 1 = 1` and `|2| * 4 = 8`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1, 1], [1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 3 = 3` and `|2| * 2 = 4`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is actually `([-1], [1, -1, 1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 1 = 1` and `|2| * 4 = 8`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1], [1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 3 = 3` and `|2| * 2 = 4`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is actually `([-1], [1, -1, 1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 1 = 1` and `|2| * 4 = 8`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1], [1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 3 = 3` and `|2| * 2 = 4`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is actually `([-1], [1, -1, 1, 1])`
