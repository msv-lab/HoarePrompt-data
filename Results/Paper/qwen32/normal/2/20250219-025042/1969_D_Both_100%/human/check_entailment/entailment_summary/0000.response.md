### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided code to ensure it aligns with the problem statement and the expected behavior.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_1()` reads a single integer from the input, which is the number of test cases.
   - `func_2()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, which can be used for reading `n`, `k`, `a_i`, and `b_i`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the code initializes a heap (`heap`) and a list of remaining items (`remaining_items`).
   - It reads `n` (number of items) and `k` (number of items Bob can take for free).
   - It reads the prices for Alice (`prices`) and Bob (`bonuses`).
   - The prices for Alice are negated (`neg_prices`) because we want to use a min-heap to simulate a max-heap.

3. **Sorting Items:**
   - The items are combined into tuples of `(-a_i, b_i)` and sorted based on `b_i`. This ensures that items with higher bonuses are considered first.

4. **Initial Heap Population:**
   - The first `k` items are pushed onto the heap. These are the items Bob can take for free initially.

5. **Calculating Initial Profit:**
   - The initial profit is calculated using `func_3()`, which sums the values of items in the heap and adds the non-negative differences between `a_i` and `b_i` for the remaining items.

6. **Iterative Profit Calculation:**
   - The code iterates through the remaining items, adjusting the current profit by considering the effect of adding a new item and removing the least beneficial item from the heap.
   - If the current profit exceeds the maximum profit seen so far, it updates the maximum profit.

7. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the maximum profit is printed.

### Analysis:

- The approach correctly handles the constraints and the problem requirements.
- By sorting items based on `b_i` and using a heap to manage the items Bob can take for free, the code ensures that Alice maximizes her profit while Bob minimizes it.
- The use of `func_3()` to calculate the initial profit and the iterative adjustment of the profit during the loop are consistent with the optimal strategy described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
