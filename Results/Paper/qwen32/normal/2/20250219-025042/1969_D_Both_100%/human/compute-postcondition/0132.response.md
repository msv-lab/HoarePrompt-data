The code snippet assigns the values returned by `func_2()` to the variables `n` and `k`. Since the exact return values of `func_2()` are not specified, we will denote them as `n_value` and `k_value` respectively. 

Given that `k` was initially set to the original length of `combined` and `combined` is empty, `k` was initially 0. After the function call, `k` will take the value `k_value` returned by `func_2()`. Similarly, `n` will take the value `n_value`.

The other variables (`heap`, `combined`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `remaining_items`, `test_cases`, `current_profit`, `max_profit`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`heap` is an empty list; `k` is `k_value`; `combined` is empty; `n` is `n_value`; `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and still greater than 0; `current_profit` is the net profit after processing all items; `max_profit` is the maximum profit encountered during the loop.**
