You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: heap is a list that will be used as a min-heap, remaining_items is a list that may store items not yet processed, n is an integer representing the number of items, k is an integer representing the number of items Bob can take for free, prices is a list of integers representing the prices of items for Alice, neg_prices is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, bonuses is a list of integers representing the bonuses Alice receives from selling items to Bob, max_profit is an integer representing the maximum profit Alice can achieve, current_profit is an integer representing the current profit Alice has, combined is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the negative price and bonus of an item.
def func_4():
    test_cases = func_1()
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        heap = []
        
        remaining_items = []
        
        n, k = func_2()
        
        prices = list(func_2())

        if combined:
            current_profit = func_3(combined, heap)
        
        if current_profit > max_profit:
            max_profit = current_profit
        
        while combined:
            item = combined.pop()
            if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
                current_profit -= item[1]
            else:
                current_profit += item[0]
            removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
            if removed_item:
                current_profit -= removed_item[0]
            if current_profit > max_profit:
                max_profit = current_profit
        
        print(max_profit)
        
    #State: heap is an empty list; k is the number of items Bob can take for free; n is the number of items from the last test case; prices is the list of prices from the last test case; neg_prices is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in prices from the last test case; bonuses is the list of bonuses from the last test case; remaining_items is an empty list; test_cases is 0; combined is an empty list; current_profit reflects the net profit after processing all items from the last test case; max_profit holds the maximum profit encountered across all test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but uses several global variables including `heap` (a list used as a min-heap), `remaining_items` (a list of unprocessed items), `n` (an integer representing the number of items), `k` (an integer representing the number of items Bob can take for free), `prices` (a list of integers representing the prices of items for Alice), `neg_prices` (a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice), `bonuses` (a list of integers representing the bonuses Alice receives from selling items to Bob), `max_profit` (an integer representing the maximum profit Alice can achieve), `current_profit` (an integer representing the current profit Alice has), and `combined` (a list of tuples where each tuple contains the negative price and bonus of an item). The function calculates and returns the maximum profit Alice can achieve by strategically selling items to Bob, taking into account the bonuses she receives and the fact that Bob can take up to `k` items for free.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
