Output State: **`heap` contains the elements of the original `heap` with `item` added and the smallest element removed; `k` is 1; `item` is the last element of the new `combined` list; `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `remaining_items`, `test_cases` remain unchanged; `combined` has one less element than it originally did; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was removed from the `heap`; if `removed_item` is truthy, `current_profit` is adjusted to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`; `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit`.**

In simpler terms: The `max_profit` has been updated to the current value of `current_profit`. All other variables remain unchanged from their described initial states.
