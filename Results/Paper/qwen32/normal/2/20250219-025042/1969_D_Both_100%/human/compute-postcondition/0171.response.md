The only variable in the loop head is `combined`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `combined`. If `combined` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `combined` has one less tuple than before. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `combined` must contain at least one more tuple.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`heap` contains the `item` that was pushed in, and the smallest element from the original `heap` is now removed and stored in `removed_item`. `removed_item` is truthy (i.e., not None, False, 0, or an empty collection). `combined` must contain at least one more tuple. `n` is `n_value`. `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`. `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `remaining_items` is an empty list. `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and still greater than 0. `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined`. `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`. `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`.**
