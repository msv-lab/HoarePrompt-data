Output State: **`heap` is an empty list; `k` is `k_value`; `combined` is empty; `n` is `n_value`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and still greater than 0; `current_profit` is the net profit after processing all items; `max_profit` is 0.**

Explanation: The only change made by the code is setting `max_profit` to 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
