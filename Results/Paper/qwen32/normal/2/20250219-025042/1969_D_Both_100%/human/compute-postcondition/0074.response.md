The code snippet combines the `neg_prices` list and the `bonuses` list into a list of tuples using the `zip` function. This means that each element in the new `combined` list will be a tuple consisting of a corresponding element from `neg_prices` and `bonuses`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `combined`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list; `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is greater than 1; `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a corresponding element from `neg_prices` and `bonuses`; `current_profit` is 0; `max_profit` is 0.**
