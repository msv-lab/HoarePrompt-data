Output State: **`heap` contains the last `k` tuples from the original `combined` list in the order they were popped; `combined` is not empty; `k` is 0; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, and `test_cases` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The value of `current_profit` is updated to whatever value is returned by the function `func_3(combined, heap)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
