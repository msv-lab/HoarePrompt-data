The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is a throwaway variable indicating the number of iterations. The loop will execute based on the value of `test_cases`. Since `_` does not affect the loop condition or any other variables within the loop, we only need to ensure that `test_cases` is decremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `test_cases` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `test_cases` should be reduced by 1.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`heap` is an empty list; `k` is 0; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is greater than 1; `combined` is an empty list; `current_profit` reflects the net profit after processing all items; `max_profit` holds the maximum profit encountered during the loop.`**
