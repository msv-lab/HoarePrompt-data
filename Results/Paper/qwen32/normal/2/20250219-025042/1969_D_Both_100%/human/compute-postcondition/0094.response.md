The code snippet `item = combined.pop()` removes the last element from the `combined` list and assigns it to the variable `item`. Since `k` is 0, `heap` does not contain any elements initially. After the operation, `heap` will contain the last element of the original `combined` list (which is now stored in `item`), and `combined` will have one less element.

Output State: **`heap` contains the last element of the original `combined` list; `k` is 1; `item` is the last element of the original `combined` list; `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `remaining_items`, `test_cases` remain unchanged; `combined` has one less element than before.**
