The code snippet `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())` performs two main actions:
1. It removes the last element from the `combined` list using `combined.pop()`.
2. It pushes this removed element into the `heap` list using `heapq.heappush(heap, ...)`.

Given the initial state, `combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple, and the last tuple was already removed and stored in `heap` if `combined` was not empty. After executing the code, the last element of the updated `combined` list (after the pop operation) is added to `heap`.

Here's the updated state:

- `heap` now contains the previously last element of `combined` (if `combined` was not empty before) plus the new last element of `combined` after the pop operation.
- `combined` has one less element than before, specifically the last element has been removed.
- All other variables (`k`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `remaining_items`, `test_cases`, `current_profit`, `max_profit`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` contains the previously last element of `combined` (if `combined` was not empty before) plus the new last element of `combined` after the pop operation; `combined` has one less element than before; `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is greater than 1; `current_profit` is 0; `max_profit` is 0.**
