In this task, the `while` loop condition is `while combined:`. This means the loop will execute as long as `combined` is not an empty list.

Given the state right before the `while` loop:
- `heap` contains the last `k` tuples from the original `combined` list if `combined` had at least `k` tuples.
- `k` is `0`.
- `combined` has `len(combined) - k` tuples remaining.
- `n` is `n_value`.
- `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`.
- `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`.
- `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`.
- `remaining_items` is an empty list.
- `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and still greater than 0.
- `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` is `0`.
- `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, `combined` must not be an empty list. Therefore, we need to adjust the state so that `combined` contains at least one tuple.

State: **`heap` contains the last `k` tuples from the original `combined` list if `combined` had at least `k` tuples; `k` is `0`; `combined` has at least one tuple; `n` is `n_value`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and still greater than 0; `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` is `0`; `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged.**
