The code snippet assigns the result of `func_2()` to the variable `bonuses`. This means that whatever list `func_2()` returns will now be stored in `bonuses`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list; `k` is `k_value`; `combined` is empty; `n` is `n_value`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and still greater than 0; `current_profit` is the net profit after processing all items; `max_profit` is the maximum profit encountered during the loop.`**

In natural language: The variable `bonuses` now holds the list returned by `func_2()`. All other variables retain their previous values.
