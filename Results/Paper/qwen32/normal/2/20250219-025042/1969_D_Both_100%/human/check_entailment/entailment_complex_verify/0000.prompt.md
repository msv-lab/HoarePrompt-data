You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

Output

Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

It processes multiple test cases, each with its own set of items, prices, and bonuses, and outputs the maximum profit for each test case.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze whether it adheres to the problem description and handles all edge cases appropriately. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program and its logic:

### Problem Breakdown:
- Alice and Bob are playing a game involving `n` items.
- Each item has two prices: `a_i` (price for Alice) and `b_i` (price for Bob).
- Alice selects a subset of items to buy.
- Bob either takes all items for free if Alice buys fewer than `k` items, or he takes `k` items for free and pays for the rest.
- Alice's profit is calculated as the difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of items) and `k` (number of items Bob can take for free).
   - It then reads the lists of prices for Alice (`a_i`) and Bob (`b_i`).

2. **Sorting Items:**
   - The program combines the negative prices for Alice (`-a_i`) and the bonuses (`b_i`) into tuples and sorts these tuples based on `b_i`.

3. **Heap Operations:**
   - A heap is used to keep track of the `k` items with the highest bonuses.
   - The program calculates the initial profit considering the `k` items Bob can take for free.
   - It iterates through the remaining items, updating the profit based on whether the current item is beneficial for Alice to include.

4. **Updating Profit:**
   - For each item, the program updates the current profit by adding the benefit of including the item and subtracting the cost of the least beneficial item already in the heap.
   - It keeps track of the maximum profit encountered during this process.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Cases:** The program should handle cases where `k = 0`, `k = n`, and `k` is between 0 and `n`.
- **Heap Operations:** The use of a heap ensures that the `k` most beneficial items are always considered, but the logic for updating the profit needs to be verified.
- **Sorting:** The sorting based on `b_i` ensures that items with higher bonuses are prioritized, which aligns with the goal of maximizing Alice's profit.

### Testing the Program:
Let's consider the provided example cases to verify the correctness of the program:

#### Example 1:
```
2 0
2 1
1 2
```
- Alice should buy the 2nd item and sell it to Bob.
- Profit: `2 - 1 = 1`.

#### Example 2:
```
4 1
1 2 1 4
3 3 2 3
```
- Alice should buy the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd items.
- Bob takes the 1st item for free and pays for the 2nd and 3rd items.
- Profit: `(3 + 2) - (1 + 2 + 1) = 1`.

#### Example 3:
```
4 2
2 1 1 1
4 2 3 2
```
- Alice should buy all items.
- Bob takes the 1st and 3rd items for free.
- Profit: `(4 + 2) - (2 + 1 + 1 + 1) = 0`.

#### Example 4:
```
6 2
1 3 4 9 1 3
7 6 8 10 6 8
```
- Alice should buy all items.
- Bob takes the 1st and 5th items for free.
- Profit: `(7 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 8) - (1 + 3 + 4 + 9 + 1 + 3) = 7`.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and testing it with the provided examples, it appears to handle the problem requirements correctly. The logic for sorting items, using a heap to track the `k` most beneficial items, and updating the profit seems sound.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
