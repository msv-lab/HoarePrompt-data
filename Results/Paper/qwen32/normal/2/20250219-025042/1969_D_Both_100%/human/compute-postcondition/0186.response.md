The code `removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` removes the smallest element from `heap` and then pushes `item` onto `heap`, returning the smallest element that was removed.

Given the initial state:
- `heap` contains `item` and the smallest element from the original `heap` is replaced by `item`.
- `removed_item` is the smallest element from the original `heap`.
- `combined` contains at least one more tuple (one less than before).
- `n` is `n_value`.
- `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`.
- `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`.
- `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`.
- `remaining_items` is an empty list.
- `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and still greater than 0.
- `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined`.
- If `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - item[1]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit + item[0]`.
- `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.

After executing `removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)`, the smallest element from the original `heap` is now stored in `removed_item`, and `item` is inserted into `heap`, potentially changing its structure but not affecting its properties as a heap.

The variables `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `remaining_items`, `test_cases`, `n`, `current_profit`, and `max_profit` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` contains `item` and the smallest element from the original `heap` is replaced by `item`; `removed_item` is the smallest element from the original `heap`; `combined` contains at least one more tuple (one less than before); `n` is `n_value`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and still greater than 0; `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined`; `current_profit` is updated based on the condition `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`; `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`.**
