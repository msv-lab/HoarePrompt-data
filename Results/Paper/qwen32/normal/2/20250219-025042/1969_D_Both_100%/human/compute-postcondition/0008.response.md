Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is an integer representing the current profit Alice has, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the negative price and bonus of an item, `test_cases` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that `max_profit` has been explicitly set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
