Postcondition: **`heap` contains the elements of the original `heap` with `item` added and the smallest element removed; `k` is 1; `item` is the last element of the original `combined` list; `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `remaining_items`, `test_cases` remain unchanged; `combined` has one less element than before; `current_profit` is adjusted based on the condition `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`; `removed_item` is the smallest element in the original `heap` and `removed_item` is truthy.**
