The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use) and `k`. Since `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop condition, the only variable we need to adjust is `k`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is `k_value` and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be decremented by 1 and still be greater than 0.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`heap` contains the last tuple from `combined` if `combined` is non-empty; `k` is `k_value - 1` and must be greater than 0; `combined` is a list of tuples with one less tuple if `combined` was non-empty; `n` is `n_value`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and still greater than 0; `current_profit` is 0; `max_profit` is 0.**
