The code snippet provided updates the `neg_prices` list by negating each value in the `prices` list. Since the `prices` list is already defined as the list returned by `func_2()`, the `neg_prices` list will now contain the negative values of the elements in `prices`.

Here's the updated state:

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list; `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is greater than 1; `combined` is an empty list; `current_profit` reflects the net profit after processing all items; `max_profit` holds the maximum profit encountered during the loop.`**

In natural language, the output state is: `heap` remains an empty list, `k` and `n` retain their values as the second and first values returned by `func_2()` respectively, `prices` retains its original list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is now a list containing the negative values of the elements in `prices`, `bonuses` retains its list returned by `func_2()`, `remaining_items` remains an empty list, `test_cases` is still greater than 1, `combined` remains an empty list, `current_profit` still reflects the net profit after processing all items, and `max_profit` still holds the maximum profit encountered during the loop.
