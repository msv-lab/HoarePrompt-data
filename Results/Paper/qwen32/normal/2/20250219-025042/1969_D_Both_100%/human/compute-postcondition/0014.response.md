The code snippet removes the last element from the `combined` list using `pop()` and pushes it onto the `heap` list using `heapq.heappush()`. This operation changes the state of both `heap` and `combined`.

Since `combined` is initially a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple, after `combined.pop()` is executed, the last tuple in `combined` is removed. The `heap` list, which was initially empty, now contains this tuple.

The values of `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, and `test_cases` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`heap` contains the last tuple from the original `combined` list; `combined` has one less tuple than before; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` must be greater than 0, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `test_cases` must be greater than 0.**
