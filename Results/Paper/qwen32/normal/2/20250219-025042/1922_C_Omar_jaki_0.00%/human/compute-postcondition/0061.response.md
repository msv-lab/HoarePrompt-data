To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `u` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1. This means `u` was originally some integer `n`, and now it is `n - 1`.
- `c` and `d` are the values returned by the function `r()`.
- The current value of `c` is less than the current value of `d`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables `c` and `d`:**
   - These are the values returned by the function `r()`. Since `c < d`, `c` is a smaller integer compared to `d`.

2. **Index Calculations:**
   - `(d - 1) * 2`: This calculates an index in the list `b` based on the value of `d`.
   - `(c - 1) * 2`: This calculates another index in the list `b` based on the value of `c`.

3. **List `b`:**
   - The list `b` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but we know it is being accessed using the indices calculated above.
   - The elements at these indices are being subtracted: `b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]`.

### Output Description:
- The output will be the result of subtracting the element at index `(c - 1) * 2` from the element at index `(d - 1) * 2` in the list `b`.

Since the specific values of `c`, `d`, and the contents of the list `b` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical result. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the given information.

### Final Output:
Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2] (where b is the list, c and d are values returned by r(), and c < d)**
