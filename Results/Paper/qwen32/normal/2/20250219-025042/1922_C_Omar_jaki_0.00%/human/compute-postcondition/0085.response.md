Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's analyze the changes:

- `t` is 0; This variable is not affected by the code.
- `a` is (-1000000000.0, 2000000000.0, some_value_1, some_value_2); This tuple is not affected by the code.
- `b` is [0, 0]; This list will be modified.
- `v` is undefined; This variable is used in the code but is undefined, which means the operations involving `v` will result in an error.

However, since the task requires us to simulate the execution and provide the output state, we'll assume that the code is intended to run without errors. Given that `v` is undefined, the expression `v ** (v > x - w)` and `v ** (v > z - y)` would normally raise a `NameError`. But for the sake of this exercise, let's assume `v` is 0 (since any number to the power of 0 is 1, and 0 to any power is 0).

Let's proceed with `v` being 0:

- `b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`
- `b[-2]` refers to the second last element of `b`, which is 0.
- `b[-1]` refers to the last element of `b`, which is also 0.
- Since `v` is 0, `v ** (v > x - w)` evaluates to `0 ** (False)` which is `0 ** 0` and is typically considered 1 in Python.
- Similarly, `v ** (v > z - y)` evaluates to `0 ** (False)` which is `0 ** 0` and is typically considered 1 in Python.
- Therefore, `b += 0 + 1, 0 + 1` results in `b += 1, 1`.
- After this operation, `b` becomes `[0, 0, 1, 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is 0; `a` is (-1000000000.0, 2000000000.0, some_value_1, some_value_2); `b` is [0, 0, 1, 1]; `v` is undefined**. 

Note: In a real execution environment, the code would raise a `NameError` due to `v` being undefined.
