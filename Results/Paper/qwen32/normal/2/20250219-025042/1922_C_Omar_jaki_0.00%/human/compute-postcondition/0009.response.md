To determine the new state after executing the given code snippet, let's break down the changes:

1. **Initial State Recap:**
   - `t` is an integer derived from `r() - 1` within the range \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4-1\).
   - `n` is an integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of `n+2` integers, specifically structured as:
     - First element: `-1000000000.0`
     - Last element: `2000000000.0`
     - Middle `n` elements: Sorted in increasing order.
   - `m` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\).
   - `r` is a lambda function mapping input to integers.
   - `b` is initialized as `[0, 0]`.
   - `w` is the first element of `a`, which is `-1000000000.0`.
   - `x` is the second element of `a`.
   - `y` is the third element of `a`.
   - `z` is the fourth element of `a`.
   - `v` is calculated as `y - x`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   ```python
   b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
   ```
   - `b[-2]` refers to the second-to-last element of `b`, which is `0` initially.
   - `b[-1]` refers to the last element of `b`, which is also `0` initially.
   - `v` is `y - x`.
   - `v > x - w` evaluates to `True` because `v` is positive (since `y` and `x` are sorted in increasing order and `w` is the smallest).
   - `v > z - y` evaluates to `True` or `False` depending on the relative values of `z`, `y`, and `v`.

3. **Calculations:**
   - `v ** (v > x - w)` simplifies to `v ** True`, which is `v`.
   - `v ** (v > z - y)` simplifies to `v ** True` if `v > z - y` is `True`, otherwise `v ** False` which is `1`.

4. **Updating `b`:**
   - `b += b[-2] + v, b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`
   - Since `b[-2]` and `b[-1]` are both `0`:
     - `b += 0 + v, 0 + v ** (v > z - y)`
     - `b += v, v ** (v > z - y)`

5. **Final State:**
   - `b` was initially `[0, 0]` and now becomes `[0, 0, v, v ** (v > z - y)]`.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value returned by `r()` minus 1, which satisfies \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4-1\); `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `a` is a list of `n+2` integers where the first element is `-1000000000.0`, the last element is `2000000000.0`, and the middle `n` elements are the original integers in increasing order; `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\), and for each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that \(1 \leq x_i, y_i \leq n+2\) and \(x_i \neq y_i\); `r` is a lambda function that maps input to integers; `b` is `[0, 0, v, v ** (v > z - y)]`; `w` is the first element of `a`, which is `-1000000000.0`; `x` is the second element of `a`; `y` is the third element of `a`; `z` is the fourth element of `a`; `v` is `y - x`.**
