To determine the output state, let's break down the given code snippet and its effects on the variables:

Given:
- `t` is 0
- `a` is `(-1000000000.0, 2000000000.0, some_value_1, some_value_2)`
- `b` is `[0, 0, 1, 1]`
- `v` is `y - x`

Code snippet:
```python
b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
```

Let's analyze the code step-by-step:

1. `b[-2]` refers to the second-to-last element of `b`, which is `1`.
2. `b[-1]` refers to the last element of `b`, which is also `1`.
3. `v ** (v > x - w)` involves two parts:
   - `(v > x - w)` evaluates to a boolean (`True` or `False`).
   - `v ** True` is equivalent to `v ** 1`, which is `v`.
   - `v ** False` is equivalent to `v ** 0`, which is `1`.

4. Similarly, `v ** (v > z - y)` involves:
   - `(v > z - y)` evaluates to a boolean (`True` or `False`).
   - `v ** True` is `v`.
   - `v ** False` is `1`.

Therefore, the expression `b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)` can be broken down into:
- `b += 1 + v ** (v > x - w), 1 + v ** (v > z - y)`

Since the exact values of `x`, `w`, `y`, and `z` are not provided, we cannot determine whether `v > x - w` and `v > z - y` are `True` or `False`. However, we can represent the final state of `b` in terms of these conditions.

Thus, the new elements added to `b` are:
- `1 + v` if `v > x - w` is `True`, otherwise `1 + 1` (which is `2`)
- `1 + v` if `v > z - y` is `True`, otherwise `1 + 1` (which is `2`)

So, the updated `b` will be:
- If both conditions are `True`: `b` becomes `[0, 0, 1, 1, 1 + v, 1 + v]`
- If the first condition is `True` and the second is `False`: `b` becomes `[0, 0, 1, 1, 1 + v, 2]`
- If the first condition is `False` and the second is `True`: `b` becomes `[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1 + v]`
- If both conditions are `False`: `b` becomes `[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]`

Since we don't have the exact values of `x`, `w`, `y`, and `z`, we'll represent the output state in terms of these conditions.

Output State: **`t` is 0; `a` is `(-1000000000.0, 2000000000.0, some_value_1, some_value_2)`; `b` is `[0, 0, 1, 1, 1 + v if v > x - w else 2, 1 + v if v > z - y else 2]`; `v` is `y - x`**
