To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables defined in the loop head: `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`. These variables are derived from the tuple `a` using the `zip` function.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is 0
- `a` is `(-1000000000.0, 2000000000.0, some_value_1, some_value_2)`
- `b` is `[0, 0, 1, 1, 1 + v if v > x - w else 2, 1 + v if v > z - y else 2]`
- `v` is `y - x`

From the loop definition:
```python
for (w, x, y, z) in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    # the loop body is omit
```
In the first iteration, the values of `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` would be:
- `w` = `-1000000000.0` (first element of `a`)
- `x` = `2000000000.0` (second element of `a`)
- `y` = `some_value_1` (third element of `a`)
- `z` = `some_value_2` (fourth element of `a`)

Since `a` has only four elements, the loop will run only once because there aren't enough elements to form another set of `(w, x, y, z)`.

Thus, there is no next iteration to adjust the state for. The loop will terminate after this iteration.

However, if we were to consider the hypothetical scenario where `a` had more than four elements, the state at the start of the next iteration would be determined by the next set of elements from `a`.

For completeness, let's assume `a` had more elements, say `a = (-1000000000.0, 2000000000.0, some_value_1, some_value_2, some_value_3, some_value_4)`.

Then, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `w` = `2000000000.0` (second element of `a`)
- `x` = `some_value_1` (third element of `a`)
- `y` = `some_value_2` (fourth element of `a`)
- `z` = `some_value_3` (fifth element of `a`)

But since `a` only has four elements, the loop will not execute a second time.

Therefore, the final answer based on the given state is that there is no next iteration to adjust:

State: **`t` is 0; `a` is `(-1000000000.0, 2000000000.0, some_value_1, some_value_2)`; `b` is `[0, 0, 1, 1, 1 + v if v > x - w else 2, 1 + v if v > z - y else 2]`; `v` is `y - x`**
