Postcondition: **The list remains [0, 0, d_1, d_1, d_1 + d_2, d_1 + d_2, ..., sum(d_1, ..., d_{n-2}), sum(d_1, ..., d_{n-2}) + d_{n-1}]. `u` is 0. `c` is the first value returned by `r()`, and `d` is the second value returned by `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.**
