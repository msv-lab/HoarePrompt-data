To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is initialized to 0.
- `a` is a tuple with values `(-1000000000.0, 2000000000.0)`.
- `b` is a list with values `[0, 0]`.
- `u` is initialized to 0.
- `c` and `d` are the values returned by the function `r()`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
```

### Analysis:
1. **List `b`**: The list `b` contains two elements, both of which are `0`. So, `b = [0, 0]`.

2. **Indices Calculation**:
   - The expression `c * 2 - 1` calculates an index into the list `b`.
   - Similarly, the expression `d * 2 - 1` calculates another index into the list `b`.

3. **Values of `c` and `d`**:
   - Since `c` and `d` are the values returned by the function `r()`, we do not have explicit values for them from the given initial state.
   - However, we know that `c` and `d` must be integers because they are used in arithmetic operations (`c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1`).

4. **Possible Indices**:
   - Given that `b` has only two elements (at indices `0` and `1`), the valid indices derived from `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1` must be either `0` or `1`.
   - For `c * 2 - 1` to be `0`, `c` must be `0.5`, but since `c` is an integer, this is not possible.
   - For `c * 2 - 1` to be `1`, `c` must be `1`.
   - Therefore, the only valid integer values for `c` and `d` that result in valid indices for `b` are `0` and `1`.

5. **Calculation of the Print Statement**:
   - If `c` is `0`, then `c * 2 - 1` is `-1`, which is out of bounds for the list `b`. However, Python lists support negative indexing, so `b[-1]` refers to the last element of the list, which is `0`.
   - If `c` is `1`, then `c * 2 - 1` is `1`, which refers to the second element of the list `b`, which is also `0`.
   - Similarly, if `d` is `0`, then `d * 2 - 1` is `-1`, referring to the last element of the list `b`, which is `0`.
   - If `d` is `1`, then `d * 2 - 1` is `1`, referring to the second element of the list `b`, which is also `0`.

6. **Result**:
   - Regardless of whether `c` and `d` are `0` or `1`, `b[c * 2 - 1]` and `b[d * 2 - 1]` will both be `0`.
   - Therefore, the expression `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]` will always evaluate to `0 - 0`, which is `0`.

### Conclusion:
Output: **0**
