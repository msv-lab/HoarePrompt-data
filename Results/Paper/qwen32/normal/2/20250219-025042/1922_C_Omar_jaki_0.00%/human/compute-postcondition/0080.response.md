The code snippet `r()` calls a function named `r`. However, there is no definition of the function `r` provided in the initial state. Without knowing what the function `r` does, we cannot determine how the state of the program changes, particularly the value of `t`.

Given the lack of information about the function `r`, we can only assume that the call to `r()` does not affect the variable `t` unless specified otherwise.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`t` is 0**.
