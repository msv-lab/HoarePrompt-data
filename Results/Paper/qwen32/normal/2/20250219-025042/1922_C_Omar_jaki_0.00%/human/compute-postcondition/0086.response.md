To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`. These variables are derived from the `zip` function applied to slices of the tuple `a`.

Given the loop:
```python
for (w, x, y, z) in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is 0
- `a` is `(-1000000000.0, 2000000000.0, some_value_1, some_value_2)`
- `b` is `[0, 0, 1, 1]`
- `v` is undefined

Let's analyze the `zip` function:
- `a` gives the first element: `-1000000000.0`
- `a[1:]` gives the elements starting from the second: `2000000000.0, some_value_1, some_value_2`
- `a[2:]` gives the elements starting from the third: `some_value_1, some_value_2`
- `a[3:]` gives the elements starting from the fourth: `some_value_2`

In the first iteration, the values of `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` would be:
- `w` = `-1000000000.0`
- `x` = `2000000000.0`
- `y` = `some_value_1`
- `z` = `some_value_2`

Since `a` has only 4 elements, the loop will run only once because `a[3:]` will have only one element, and after that, there won't be enough elements to form another tuple `(w, x, y, z)`.

Therefore, there is no next iteration possible given the current state of `a`.

However, if we hypothetically consider what the state would look like just before the loop terminates, it would be:

State: **`t` is 0; `a` is `(-1000000000.0, 2000000000.0, some_value_1, some_value_2)`; `b` is `[0, 0, 1, 1]`; `v` is undefined; `w` is `some_value_1`; `x` is `some_value_2`; `y` is undefined; `z` is undefined**

But since the loop cannot execute another iteration, the final state at the start of the non-existent next iteration remains as the state after the previous iteration:

State: **`t` is 0; `a` is `(-1000000000.0, 2000000000.0, some_value_1, some_value_2)`; `b` is `[0, 0, 1, 1]`; `v` is undefined**
