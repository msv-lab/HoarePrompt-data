Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input split by whitespace, where the first element is the number of test cases `t`, followed by pairs of strings for each test case (the first being the number of coins `n` and the second being the string `s`). `index` is 1; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`.**

Explanation: The value of `index` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables (`data` and `t`) remain unchanged.
