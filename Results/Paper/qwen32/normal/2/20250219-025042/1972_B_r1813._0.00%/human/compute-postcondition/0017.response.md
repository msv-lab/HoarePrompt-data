Postcondition: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input split by whitespace, where the first element is the number of test cases `t` (which must be greater than 0), followed by pairs of strings for each test case (the first being the number of coins `n` and the second being the string `s`). `index` is 3; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` (and `t` must be greater than 0). `results` is a list containing either the string `'YES'` if `num_up_coins` is odd, or the string `'NO'` if `num_up_coins` is even. `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `s` is `data[2]`; `num_up_coins` is the count of 'U' in `s`.**
