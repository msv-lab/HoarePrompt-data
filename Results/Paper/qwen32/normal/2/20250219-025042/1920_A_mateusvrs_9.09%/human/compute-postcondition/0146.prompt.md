Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; Each constraint is described by a pair of integers (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9; There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case; No two constraints are the same (all pairs (a, x) are distinct); `r` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cx = set()
    ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
    bx = -1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, x = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1:
            bx = max(x, bx)
        elif a == 2:
            ax = min(x, ax)
        else:
            cx.add(x)
    if bx >= ax:
        r.append(0)
    else:
        tmp = 0
        for i in cx:
            if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                tmp += 1
        r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `ax` is the smallest `x` encountered when `a` was 2, `bx` is the largest `x` encountered when `a` was 1, and `cx` is a set of all `x` encountered when `a` was neither 1 nor 2. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` is a list containing the single element `[0]`. Otherwise, `r` is a list containing one element `[ax - bx + 1 - tmp]`, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ax` is the smallest value from inputs where `a == 2`, `bx` is the largest value from inputs where `a == 1`, and `cx` is a set of all unique values from inputs where `a == 3`. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` contains `0`. Otherwise, `bx` is less than `ax`, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), and `r` has a new element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ax` is the minimum value of `x` encountered when `a == 2`, or `1000000007` if no such `x` was encountered; `bx` is the maximum value of `x` encountered when `a == 1`, or `-1` if no such `x` was encountered; `cx` is a set of all unique `x` values encountered when `a == 3`; `r` is a list that may contain elements `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` if `bx < ax`, and additionally contains `0` if `bx >= ax`, or an element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` if `bx < ax`; `t` is decremented by `n` (the total number of iterations); `n` is the number of iterations performed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
