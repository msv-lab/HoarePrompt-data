The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the elements in the set `cx`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how `i` changes.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 100
- `r` is an empty list
- `ax` is the smallest `x` encountered when `a` was 2
- `bx` is the largest `x` encountered when `a` was 1
- `cx` is a set containing at least one element
- `bx` is less than `ax`
- `tmp` is 1 if `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and `i` is less than or equal to `ax`; otherwise, `tmp` remains 0

Since `i` iterates over the elements in the set `cx`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should take the next value from the set `cx`. Let's denote this next value as `next_i`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `r` is an empty list, `ax` is the smallest `x` encountered when `a` was 2, `bx` is the largest `x` encountered when `a` was 1, `cx` is a set containing at least one element, `bx` is less than `ax`, `i` is `next_i` (the next element in `cx`), and `tmp` is 1 if `next_i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and `next_i` is less than or equal to `ax`; otherwise, `tmp` remains 0**.

Since the exact value of `next_i` depends on the current elements in `cx` and the iteration order, we represent it as `next_i`. The condition for `tmp` is also updated based on this new value of `i`.
