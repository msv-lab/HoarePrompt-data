To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the variables evolve with each iteration and how they contribute to the final result stored in the list `r`.

### Understanding the Loop Execution

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t`: Number of iterations (initially given).
   - `n`: Number of constraints per iteration (given within each iteration).
   - `cx`: A set to store unique `x` values when `a == 3`.
   - `ax`: Initialized to a large number (`1000000007`), updated to the minimum `x` when `a == 2`.
   - `bx`: Initialized to `-1`, updated to the maximum `x` when `a == 1`.
   - `r`: An initially empty list that stores the results of each iteration.

2. **Processing Each Constraint**:
   - For each constraint `(a, x)`:
     - If `a == 1`, update `bx` to be the maximum of `bx` and `x`.
     - If `a == 2`, update `ax` to be the minimum of `ax` and `x`.
     - If `a == 3`, add `x` to the set `cx`.

3. **Final Calculation for Each Iteration**:
   - If `bx >= ax`, append `0` to `r`.
   - Otherwise, compute `tmp` as the count of elements in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive). Append `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` to `r`.

4. **Loop Completion**:
   - The loop runs `t` times, processing `n` constraints per iteration.
   - After all iterations, `r` contains the results of each iteration.

### Final Output State

After all `t` iterations, the final output state will be:

- `t` will be `0` because the loop runs `t` times and then terminates.
- `n` will be the number of constraints processed in the last iteration.
- `r` will contain `t` elements, each representing the result of one iteration.
- `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` will reflect the values computed during the last iteration.

### Formatted Output State

Output State: **t is 0, n is the number of constraints in the last iteration, cx is a set of unique x values from the last iteration where a == 3, ax is the minimum x from the last iteration where a == 2, bx is the maximum x from the last iteration where a == 1, and r is a list of results from each iteration.**

### Human-readable Explanation

After all iterations of the loop have finished:
- The variable `t` will be `0` because the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The variable `n` will hold the number of constraints processed in the last iteration.
- The variable `cx` will contain unique `x` values from the last iteration where the constraint type `a` was `3`.
- The variable `ax` will be the smallest `x` value encountered in the last iteration where the constraint type `a` was `2`.
- The variable `bx` will be the largest `x` value encountered in the last iteration where the constraint type `a` was `1`.
- The list `r` will contain `t` elements, each representing the result of one iteration: either `0` if `bx` was greater than or equal to `ax`, or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` otherwise, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that fall between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive).
