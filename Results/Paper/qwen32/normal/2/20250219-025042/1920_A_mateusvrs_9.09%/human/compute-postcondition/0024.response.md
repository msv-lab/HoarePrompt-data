Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer. If `a` equals 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and 0, and `r` remains an empty list. If `a` equals 2, then `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and `x`, and `r` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `ax` is 1000000007, and `r` is a list containing the single element `x`.**
