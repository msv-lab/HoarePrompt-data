Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `r` is an empty list, `ax` is 1000000007, `a` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is max(x, -1). If `a` is 2, then `ax` is min(x, 1000000007). If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, then `cx` is a set containing `x`. Otherwise, `bx` remains -1.**
