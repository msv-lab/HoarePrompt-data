The code snippet provided resets the `cx` set to an empty set. This affects only the `cx` variable, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ax` is the smallest value from inputs where `a == 2`, `bx` is the largest value from inputs where `a == 1`, `cx` is a set of all unique values from inputs where `a == 3` (now reset to an empty set), `r` contains `0` if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`; otherwise, `r` has a new element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` appended to it, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer.**
