Postcondition: **`ax` is the smallest value from inputs where `a == 2`, `bx` is the largest value from inputs where `a == 1`, and `cx` is a set of all unique values from inputs where `a == 3`. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` contains `0`. Otherwise, `bx` is less than `ax`, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), and `r` has a new element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` appended to it.**
