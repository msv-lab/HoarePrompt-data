Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's determine the output state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `ax` is the smallest value from inputs where `a == 2`.
- `bx` is the largest value from inputs where `a == 1`.
- `cx` is a set of all unique values from inputs where `a == 3` and contains at least one element.
- `bx < ax`.
- `i` is `i_new` where `i_new` is another element from `cx` that hasn't been processed yet.
- `tmp` is either 1 or 2.
- If `i` is between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), `tmp` is set to 2. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 1.

### Code Execution:
```python
tmp += 1
```

### Impact Analysis:
- The code increments the value of `tmp` by 1.
- Since `tmp` was initially either 1 or 2, after the increment, `tmp` will be either 2 or 3 respectively.

### Output State:
- `ax` remains the smallest value from inputs where `a == 2`.
- `bx` remains the largest value from inputs where `a == 1`.
- `cx` remains a set of all unique values from inputs where `a == 3` and contains at least one element.
- `bx < ax` remains true.
- `i` remains `i_new` where `i_new` is another element from `cx` that hasn't been processed yet.
- `tmp` is now either 2 or 3 depending on its initial value.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`ax` is the smallest value from inputs where `a == 2`; `bx` is the largest value from inputs where `a == 1`; `cx` is a set of all unique values from inputs where `a == 3` and contains at least one element; `bx` is less than `ax`; `i` is `i_new` where `i_new` is another element from `cx` that hasn't been processed yet; `tmp` is either 2 or 3.**
