Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is the integer input by the user, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is an empty set, and `r` is a list as defined previously.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    a, x = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 1:
        bx = max(x, bx)
    elif a == 2:
        ax = min(x, ax)
    else:
        cx.add(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is greater than 0, `r` is a list as defined previously, `a` is the first integer from the input, and `x` is the second integer from the input. If `a` is 1, then `ax` is `x`, `bx` is `x`, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 1, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is decremented by 1, `r` is a list as defined previously, `a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` are calculated based on the value of `a` and `x`. If `a` equals 1, `bx` is the maximum of its previous value and `x`. If `a` equals 2, `ax` is the minimum value between `x` and the previous value of `ax`, and `bx` and `cx` are recalculated based on the value of `a` and `x`. Otherwise, `ax` and `bx` are recalculated based on the value of `a` and `x`, and `cx` includes `x` as one of its elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is incremented by 1, `a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input. If `a` equals 1, `bx` is the maximum of its previous value and `x`. If `a` equals 2, `ax` is the minimum of its previous value and `x`. Otherwise, `cx` contains the value `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
