Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a number of constraints. For each test case, it calculates and returns a value based on the constraints of types 1, 2, and 3. Specifically, it determines the difference between the smallest value of type 2 and the largest value of type 1, adjusting for any values of type 3 that fall within this range. The results for all test cases are printed, each on a new line.**
