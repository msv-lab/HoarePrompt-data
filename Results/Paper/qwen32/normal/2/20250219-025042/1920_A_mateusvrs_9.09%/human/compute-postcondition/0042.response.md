The code snippet `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. Given the initial state, `tmp` is either 0 or 1. After executing the code, `tmp` will be 1 or 2 respectively.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `r` is an empty list, `ax` is the smallest `x` encountered when `a` was 2, `bx` is the largest `x` encountered when `a` was 1, `cx` is a set containing at least one element, `bx` is less than `ax`, `i` is `next_i` (the next element in `cx`), and `tmp` is 1 if `next_i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and `next_i` is less than or equal to `ax`; otherwise, `tmp` is 2.**
