### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided code and verify whether it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is read to determine the number of test cases.
   - `r` is initialized as an empty list to store the results for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, `n` is read to determine the number of constraints.
   - `cx` is initialized as an empty set to store the values of `x` for constraints of type 3 (k ≠ x).
   - `ax` is initialized to a large value (1000000007) to represent the upper bound (minimum `x` for constraints of type 2).
   - `bx` is initialized to -1 to represent the lower bound (maximum `x` for constraints of type 1).

3. **Reading Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, the type `a` and the value `x` are read.
   - If `a == 1`, `bx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `x` (to ensure `k ≥ x`).
   - If `a == 2`, `ax` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `x` (to ensure `k ≤ x`).
   - If `a == 3`, `x` is added to the set `cx` (to ensure `k ≠ x`).

4. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - After processing all constraints, if `bx` (the lower bound) is greater than or equal to `ax` (the upper bound), it means there are no integers `k` that can satisfy all constraints, so `0` is appended to `r`.
   - Otherwise, the code calculates the number of integers between `bx` and `ax` inclusive (`ax - bx + 1`) and subtracts the count of integers in `cx` that fall within this range (`tmp`). This result is appended to `r`.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, the results for all test cases are printed, each on a new line.

### Verification Against Example Input:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Constraints: `1 3`, `2 10`, `3 1`, `3 5`
  - `bx = 3`, `ax = 10`, `cx = {1, 5}`
  - Valid `k` values: `3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10`
  - Result: `7`

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Constraints: `1 5`, `2 4`
  - `bx = 5`, `ax = 4`
  - Since `bx > ax`, no valid `k` values exist.
  - Result: `0`

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Constraints: `3 6`, `3 7`, `1 2`, `1 7`, `3 100`, `3 44`, `2 100`, `2 98`, `1 3`, `3 99`
  - `bx = 7`, `ax = 98`, `cx = {6, 7, 100, 44, 99}`
  - Valid `k` values: `2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, ..., 97, 98`
  - Result: `90`

- **Test Case 4**:
  - Constraints: `1 5`, `2 10`, `1 9`, `2 2`, `3 2`, `3 9`
  - `bx = 9`, `ax = 2`
  - Since `bx > ax`, no valid `k` values exist.
  - Result: `0`

- **Test Case 5**:
  - Constraints: `1 1`, `2 2`, `3 1`, `3 2`, `3 3`
  - `bx = 1`, `ax = 2`, `cx = {1, 2, 3}`
  - Since all possible `k` values (`1, 2`) are excluded by `cx`, no valid `k` values exist.
  - Result: `0`

- **Test Case 6**:
  - Constraints: `1 10000`, `2 900000000`, `3 500000000`, `1 100000000`, `3 10000`, `3 900000001`
  - `bx = 100000000`, `ax = 900000000`, `cx = {500000000, 10000, 900000001}`
  - Valid `k` values: `100000000, 100000001, ..., 499999999, 500000001, ..., 900000000`
  - Result: `800000000`

All test cases match the expected results, indicating that the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
