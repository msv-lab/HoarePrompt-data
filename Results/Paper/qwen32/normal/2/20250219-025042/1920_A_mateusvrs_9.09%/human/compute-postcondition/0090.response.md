The code snippet increments the value of `tmp` by 1. Given the initial state, `tmp` was either 0 or 1. After executing `tmp += 1`, `tmp` will be either 1 or 2.

Other variables (`ax`, `bx`, `cx`, `i`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by the operation `tmp += 1`.

Output State: **`ax` is the smallest value from inputs where `a == 2`, `bx` is the largest value from inputs where `a == 1`, `cx` is a set of all unique values from inputs where `a == 3` and must contain at least one element, `bx` is less than `ax`, `i` is `i_next` where `i_next` is another element from `cx` that hasn't been processed yet, `tmp` is either 1 or 2.**
