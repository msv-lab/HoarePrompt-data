The given code snippet only modifies the variable `tmp` by incrementing it by 1. None of the other variables (`ax`, `bx`, `cx`, `r`, `t`, `n`, `i`) are affected by this operation.

Given that `tmp` is incremented by 1, the new state of `tmp` will be its previous value plus 1. All other variables retain their original states as described in the initial conditions.

Output State: **`ax` is the minimum value of `x` encountered when `a == 2`, or `1000000007` if no such `x` was encountered; `bx` is the maximum value of `x` encountered when `a == 1`, or `-1` if no such `x` was encountered; `cx` is a set of all unique `x` values encountered when `a == 3` and must contain at least one element; `r` is a list that may contain elements `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` if `bx < ax`; `t` is decremented by `n` (the total number of iterations); `n` is the number of iterations performed; `bx` is less than `ax`; `i` is set to another element from `cx`; `tmp` is incremented by 1.**
