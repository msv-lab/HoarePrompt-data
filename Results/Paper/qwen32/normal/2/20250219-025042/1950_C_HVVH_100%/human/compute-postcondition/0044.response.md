Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440), and for each test case, it accepts a string `s` of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", where "hh" is a two-digit integer from "00" to "23" and "mm" is a two-digit integer from "00" to "59". The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the time provided in the format "hh:mm".**
