Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `n` is greater than 1, `h` is 12, `m` is the minute part of the new input time, and `day` remains unchanged unless recalculated based on the new `h`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `h` has been set to 12. All other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `m`, and `day`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
