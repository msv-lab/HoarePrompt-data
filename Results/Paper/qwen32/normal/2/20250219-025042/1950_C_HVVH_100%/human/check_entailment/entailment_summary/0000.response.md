### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program step-by-step to verify its correctness based on the problem description:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `n`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string in the format "hh:mm", splits it into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`), and converts them to integers.

2. **Conversion Logic:**
   - If the hour `h` is 0, it sets the hour to 12 and the day to 'AM'. This correctly handles midnight (00:00) in 24-hour format, which corresponds to 12:00 AM in 12-hour format.
   - If the hour `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` to convert it to the 12-hour format and sets the day to 'PM'. This correctly handles all times from 13:00 to 23:59 in 24-hour format.
   - If the hour `h` is between 1 and 11 inclusive, it leaves `h` unchanged and sets the day to 'AM'. This correctly handles all times from 01:00 to 11:59 in 24-hour format.
   - If the hour `h` is exactly 12, it sets the day to 'PM'. This correctly handles noon (12:00) in 24-hour format, which corresponds to 12:00 PM in 12-hour format.

3. **Output Formatting:**
   - The program uses formatted string literals (`f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}'`) to ensure that both the hour and minute components of the time have leading zeros if necessary, and then appends the appropriate AM/PM designation.

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the program against the example provided in the problem statement:

- **09:41**: `h=9`, `m=41`. Since `h` is between 1 and 11, it remains 9 and the day is 'AM'. Output: `09:41 AM`.
- **18:06**: `h=18`, `m=6`. Since `h` is greater than 12, it becomes `18-12=6` and the day is 'PM'. Output: `06:06 PM`.
- **12:14**: `h=12`, `m=14`. Since `h` is exactly 12, the day is 'PM'. Output: `12:14 PM`.
- **00:59**: `h=0`, `m=59`. Since `h` is 0, it becomes 12 and the day is 'AM'. Output: `12:59 AM`.
- **00:00**: `h=0`, `m=0`. Since `h` is 0, it becomes 12 and the day is 'AM'. Output: `12:00 AM`.
- **14:34**: `h=14`, `m=34`. Since `h` is greater than 12, it becomes `14-12=2` and the day is 'PM'. Output: `02:34 PM`.
- **01:01**: `h=1`, `m=1`. Since `h` is between 1 and 11, it remains 1 and the day is 'AM'. Output: `01:01 AM`.
- **19:07**: `h=19`, `m=7`. Since `h` is greater than 12, it becomes `19-12=7` and the day is 'PM'. Output: `07:07 PM`.
- **11:59**: `h=11`, `m=59`. Since `h` is between 1 and 11, it remains 11 and the day is 'AM'. Output: `11:59 AM`.
- **12:00**: `h=12`, `m=0`. Since `h` is exactly 12, the day is 'PM'. Output: `12:00 PM`.
- **21:37**: `h=21`, `m=37`. Since `h` is greater than 12, it becomes `21-12=9` and the day is 'PM'. Output: `09:37 PM`.

All outputs match the expected results, confirming that the program correctly converts 24-hour format times to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation as specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
