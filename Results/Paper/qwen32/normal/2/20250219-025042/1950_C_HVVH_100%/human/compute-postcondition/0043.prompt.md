Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `day` is `'AM'`, `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
    if h == 0:
        h = 12
        day = 'AM'
    elif h > 12:
        h = h - 12
        day = 'PM'
    else:
        day = 'AM'
        if h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
    print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `n` is greater than 0, `h` is the hour part of the input time, and `m` is the minute part of the input time. If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` remains 'AM'. If `h` is greater than 12, `day` is set to 'PM' and `h` is reduced by 12. If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'PM'. Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM' and `h` is less than or equal to 12.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `n` is greater than 1, `h` is the hour part of the new input time, and `m` is the minute part of the new input time. If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is set to 'AM'. If `h` is greater than 12, `h` is reduced by 12 and `day` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'PM'. Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `n` is greater than 1, `h` is the integer hour part of the new input time, `m` is the integer minute part of the new input time. If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'. If `h` is greater than 12, `h` is reduced by 12 and `day` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'PM'. Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
