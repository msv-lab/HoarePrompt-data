The code snippet assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `day`. This change affects the value of `day`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `n` is greater than 1, `h` is 12, `m` is the minute part of the new input time, `day` is 'AM'.**
