The given code snippet assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `day`. No other variables are modified. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1440 inclusive, and `s` is a string representing time in the format "hh:mm". These conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", and `day` is `'AM'`.**
