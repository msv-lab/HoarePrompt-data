To determine what will be printed by the `print(resultado)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`resultado`**: This variable holds the minimum value of the expression `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` encountered during the loop. However, the specific value of `resultado` is not explicitly given; it depends on the values of `pref`, `soma_b`, and `lista_A[i]` during the iterations of the loop.

2. **`soma_b`**: This variable represents the sum of elements in `lista_B` from index `n-k` to `n-1`. Again, the exact value of `soma_b` is not provided, but it is computed based on the elements of `lista_B` and the indices `n` and `k`.

3. **`i`**: The variable `i` is set to `n`. This means that during the last iteration of the loop, `i` would have taken the value `n`.

Given these points, the value of `resultado` is determined by the minimum value of `pref + soma_b + lista_A[n]` encountered during the loop iterations. Since the exact values of `pref`, `soma_b`, and `lista_A[n]` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `resultado`. However, we can describe its value based on the given information.

Output: **resultado (where resultado is the minimum value of pref + soma_b + lista_A[i] encountered during the loop, with i ranging from some starting point to n)**
