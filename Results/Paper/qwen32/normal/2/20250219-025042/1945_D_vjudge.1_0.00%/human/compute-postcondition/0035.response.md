To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- The loop runs from `i = n - k` to `i < n`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n - k + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, as the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The current value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be `n - k + 2` (since it was `n - k + 1` at the end of the previous iteration).
2. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers read from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed version of the newly read list of integers from the input with at least `n - k + 1` elements, `soma_b` is the sum of elements in `lista_B` from index `n-k` to the end of the list plus `lista_B[i]` plus `lista_B[n - k + 1]`, `pref` is the accumulated sum based on the loop's conditions, `resultado` is `min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])`, `i` is `n - k + 2`**
