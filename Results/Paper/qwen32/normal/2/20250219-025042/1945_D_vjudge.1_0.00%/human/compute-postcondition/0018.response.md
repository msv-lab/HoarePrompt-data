The given code snippet sets `soma_b` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, `lista_B`, `i`, or `pref`. The only change is the assignment of `soma_b` to 0.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than `k`; `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be less than `n`; `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers read from the input; `lista_B` is the reversed version of the newly read list of integers from the input; `i` is incremented by 1; `pref` is increased by `soma_b` and then further increased by `lista_A[i]`; `soma_b` is 0.**
