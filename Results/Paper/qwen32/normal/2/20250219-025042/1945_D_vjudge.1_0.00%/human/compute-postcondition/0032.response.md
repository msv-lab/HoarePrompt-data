The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(n - k, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value within the range `[n - k, n)`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, as long as it remains within the specified range.

Let's assume at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n - k + j` where `j` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= j < k`. For the next iteration, `i` should be `n - k + (j + 1)`.

Since the loop condition is `i < n`, the maximum value `i` can take is `n - 1`.

Thus, if `i` was `n - k` at the end of the previous iteration, it should now be `n - k + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers read from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed version of the newly read list of integers from the input with at least `n - k + 1` elements, `soma_b` is the sum of elements in `lista_B` from index `n-k` to the end of the list plus `lista_B[i]`, `pref` is the accumulated sum based on the loop's conditions, `resultado` is `min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])`, `i` is `n - k + 1`**
