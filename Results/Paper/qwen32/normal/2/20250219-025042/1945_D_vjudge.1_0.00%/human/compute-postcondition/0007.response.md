To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we need to consider the given loop structure and the provided output states after the first three iterations. The loop iterates `numero_testes` times, calling `func_1()` in each iteration.

Here's the loop code again for clarity:
```python
for _ in range(numero_testes):
    func_1()
```

From the provided output states:
- After 1 iteration: `numero_testes` must be greater than 0.
- After 2 iterations: `numero_testes` must be greater than 0.
- After 3 iterations: `numero_testes` must be greater than 0, and `func_1()` has been called 3 times.

This implies that `func_1()` is called once per iteration of the loop. Therefore, after all `numero_testes` iterations, `func_1()` will have been called exactly `numero_testes` times.

Since no other variables are mentioned as being modified within the loop, and the only variable affecting the loop's behavior (`numero_testes`) is used to control the number of iterations, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`numero_testes` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0; `func_1()` was called `numero_testes` times.**

In natural language: After the loop finishes executing all its iterations, `numero_testes` remains the same integer value it was initially, and the function `func_1()` has been called exactly `numero_testes` times.
