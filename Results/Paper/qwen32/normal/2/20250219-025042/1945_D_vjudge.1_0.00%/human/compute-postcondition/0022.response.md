The given code snippet modifies the variable `pref` by adding the value of `soma_b` to it. Since `soma_b` is initially 0, the value of `pref` remains unchanged unless it already had a specific value before this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than `k`.
- `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be less than `n`.
- `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers read from the input.
- `lista_B` is the reversed version of the newly read list of integers from the input.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `soma_b` is 0.

The only variable that gets updated is `pref`, which now equals its previous value plus `soma_b` (which is 0).

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than `k`; `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be less than `n`; `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers read from the input; `lista_B` is the reversed version of the newly read list of integers from the input; `i` is incremented by 1; `soma_b` is 0; `pref` is unchanged.**
