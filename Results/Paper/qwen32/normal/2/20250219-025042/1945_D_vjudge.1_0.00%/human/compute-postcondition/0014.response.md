Postcondition: **`n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than `k`, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be less than `n`, `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers read from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed version of the newly read list of integers from the input. If `lista_A[i]` is less than `lista_B[i]`, then `pref` is `pref` + `lista_A[i]` and `soma_b` remains 0. Otherwise, `soma_b` is `lista_B[i]` and `pref` is reset to 0.**
