In this case, the loop iterates based on the value of `numero_testes`. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable used when the loop variable itself is not needed. The loop will continue as long as the range function generates values, which it does until it reaches `numero_testes`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `numero_testes` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0. Since the loop variable `_` does not affect the continuation of the loop, we only need to consider `numero_testes`.

At the start of each new iteration, the loop variable `_` takes on the next value in the range from 0 to `numero_testes - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `numero_testes` must still be greater than the current value of `_`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration, we can infer that `_` was incremented by 1 from its previous value. Thus, `numero_testes` must be greater than the new value of `_`.

However, since the problem asks us to describe the state at the start of the next iteration without making assumptions about the specific value of `_`, we can simply state that `numero_testes` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`numero_testes` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0**
