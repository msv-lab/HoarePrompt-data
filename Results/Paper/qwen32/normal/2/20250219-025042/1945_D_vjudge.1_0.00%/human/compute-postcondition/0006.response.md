To determine the output state, we need to consider what `func_1()` does. However, since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine its exact impact on the variables. 

Given that `numero_testes` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, and no changes are made to `numero_testes` within the provided code snippet, we can only assume that `func_1()` does not modify `numero_testes`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except we acknowledge that `func_1()` was called.

Output State: **`numero_testes` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0; `func_1()` was called.**
