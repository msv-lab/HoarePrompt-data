To determine the output state, we need to consider the effect of calling `func_1()`. However, since the definition of `func_1()` is not provided, we can only assume that it might modify some variables or perform certain operations. Given the information, we can only conclude that `numero_testes` remains unchanged unless `func_1()` specifically modifies it.

Since there's no additional information about what `func_1()` does, we cannot determine any changes to `numero_testes` or introduce any new variables. Thus, the output state will reflect that `numero_testes` retains its initial value.

Output State: **`numero_testes` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0**.
