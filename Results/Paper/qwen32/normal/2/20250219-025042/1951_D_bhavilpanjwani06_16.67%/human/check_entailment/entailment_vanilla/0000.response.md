Let's analyze the given program step-by-step against the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` which reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Logic for Determining Output**:
   - If `n < k`, it prints "NO" because Alice doesn't have enough coins to buy `k` jewels.
   - If `n == k`, it prints "YES", sets up one stall with price `n`, and Alice will buy exactly one jewel.
   - If `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, it prints "YES", sets up two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and `1`. However, this logic is flawed because it doesn't ensure that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.

3. **Flaws in the Logic**:
   - The condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` is not sufficient to determine whether Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. It only checks a specific scenario but doesn't cover all possible ways to distribute the stalls and prices to achieve exactly `k` jewels.
   - The program does not handle cases where more than two stalls are needed, which is crucial since the problem allows up to 60 stalls.

4. **Missing Cases**:
   - The program fails to consider scenarios where more than two stalls are required to achieve exactly `k` jewels.
   - It also does not provide a correct strategy for setting up the stalls and prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

Given these points, the program is not correct as it does not cover all possible scenarios and does not provide a valid solution for all test cases.

**Correctness: False**
