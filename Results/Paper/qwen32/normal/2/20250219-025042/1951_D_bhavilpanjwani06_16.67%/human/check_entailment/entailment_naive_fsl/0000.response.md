Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic used to determine whether it is possible to set up the stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels is insufficient.

Here are some issues with the current implementation:

1. **Handling General Cases**: The program only handles a few specific scenarios:
   - When `n < k`, it correctly prints "NO".
   - When `n == k`, it correctly prints "YES" with one stall priced at `n`.
   - When `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, it incorrectly assumes that two stalls can always satisfy the condition, which is not necessarily true for all values of `n` and `k`.

2. **General Case Logic**: For the general case where `n > k`, the program needs to ensure that the sum of the maximum number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall equals `k`. The current logic does not provide a way to construct such a sequence of prices for up to 60 stalls.

3. **Constructing Valid Prices**: The program does not attempt to construct a valid sequence of prices for the stalls that would allow Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels. It only checks a few conditions and does not provide a systematic approach to generate the required prices.

To illustrate a failing case, consider the following input:

```
1
255 8
```

The correct output should be:

```
YES
8
128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
```

However, the provided program will not produce this output. Instead, it will likely fall into the `else` block and print "NO", which is incorrect.

Thus, the program is not correct for all potential cases, and the correctness is **False**.
