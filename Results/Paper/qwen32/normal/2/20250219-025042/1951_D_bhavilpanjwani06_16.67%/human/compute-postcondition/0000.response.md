The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are positive integers up to \(10^{18}\).

After executing the code, the values of `n` and `k` will be set to the integers read from the input. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ \(10^{18}\).**
