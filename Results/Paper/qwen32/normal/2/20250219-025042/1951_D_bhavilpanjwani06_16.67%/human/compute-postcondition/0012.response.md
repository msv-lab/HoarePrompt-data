Let's break down the problem step-by-step based on the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` and `k` are integers where \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k` (\(n \geq k\)).
- `n` is not equal to `k` (\(n \neq k\)).
- The current value of `k` satisfies the condition \(k - 1 < n - k + 1\).

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(n - k + 1, 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Expression Evaluation:**
   - The expression `n - k + 1` needs to be evaluated.
   - Given that \(n \geq k\), it follows that \(n - k \geq 0\).
   - Adding 1 to both sides, we get \(n - k + 1 \geq 1\).

2. **Condition Analysis:**
   - The condition \(k - 1 < n - k + 1\) can be rearranged to \(2k - 1 < n\).
   - This implies \(n > 2k - 1\).
   - Since \(n \geq k\), this condition is consistent with the given constraints.

3. **Output Values:**
   - The first value to be printed is `n - k + 1`, which is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
   - The second value to be printed is `1`.

### Final Output:
Given the constraints and the expression evaluation, the print statement will output the value of `n - k + 1` followed by `1`.

Output: **n - k + 1, 1 (where n - k + 1 is an integer greater than or equal to 1)**
