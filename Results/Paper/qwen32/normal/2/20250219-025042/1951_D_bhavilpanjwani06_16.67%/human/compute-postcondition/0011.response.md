The given initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, and `k`, but the `print` statement in the code snippet does not depend on these variables. The `print` statement simply outputs the integer `2`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
   - `n` and `k` are integers between 1 and \(10^{18}\) inclusive.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - `n` is not equal to `k`.
   - The condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` is satisfied.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The `print(2)` statement directly outputs the integer `2`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of the variables `t`, `n`, or `k`, their specific values do not influence the output.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
