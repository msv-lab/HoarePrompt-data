### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by checking three conditions for each test case:

1. If `n < k`: In this case, Alice does not have enough coins to buy `k` jewels, so the output is "NO".
2. If `n == k`: Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by buying one jewel for `n` coins, so the output is "YES" followed by `1` and `n`.
3. If `n > k`:
   - It checks whether `k - 1 < n - k + 1`. If true, it outputs "YES" with two stalls priced at `n - k + 1` and `1`. This means Alice buys `1` jewel at the first stall and the rest (`k-1`) jewels at the second stall.
   - If false, it outputs "NO".

However, the logic for the third condition is flawed. Specifically, the condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. For example, consider the case `n = 255` and `k = 8`. Here, `k - 1 < n - k + 1` translates to `7 < 248`, which is true, but the solution provided (`n - k + 1 = 248` and `1`) does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `8` jewels. Instead, it should be possible to construct a series of prices that sum up to `k` jewels bought.

The correct approach would involve constructing a sequence of prices such that the cumulative number of jewels bought equals `k`. One way to achieve this is by using powers of 2, as shown in the example output for `n = 255` and `k = 8`.

### Correctness:

Given the flawed logic in handling the case when `n > k`, the program does not always provide the correct solution. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
