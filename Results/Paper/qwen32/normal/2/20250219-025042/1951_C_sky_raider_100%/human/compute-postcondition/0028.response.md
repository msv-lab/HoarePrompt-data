Output State: **`t` is 0, `c` is `s_final * (sum(l[0:n]) + (n-1) * s_final)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are the values read from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.**

Explanation: The value of `t` has been set to 0. All other variables (`c`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
