The code snippet `k -= s` modifies the value of `k` by subtracting `s` from it. Given the initial state, `k` was initially set to `k - s`. After executing the code, `k` will be reduced by `s` again, making its new value `k - s - s` or `k - 2*s`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is `2 * s`; `n` must be greater than 0; `m` and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` now being `k - 2 * s`; `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k - s`; `c` is `s * (2 * l[i] + t)`; `i` is 1.**

In natural language: The value of `k` has been further reduced by `s`, making it `k - 2 * s`. All other variables retain their initial values or definitions.
