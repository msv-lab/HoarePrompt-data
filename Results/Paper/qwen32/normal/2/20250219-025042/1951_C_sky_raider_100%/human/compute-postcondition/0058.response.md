The value of `t` is incremented by `s`. Given that `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `t` now holds the value of `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `t` is `s`, `c` is `s * l[i]`, `i` is `n`, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.**
