The value of `c` is updated by adding `s * (l[i] + t)` to its current value. Given the initial state, `c` was `s * l[i]`. After the operation, `c` becomes `s * l[i] + s * (l[i] + t)`, which simplifies to `s * l[i] + s * l[i] + s * t` or `2 * s * l[i] + s * t`.

The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `s`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is `min(m, k)`, `c` is `2 * s * l[i] + s * t`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `m` is unchanged, `k` is `k - min(m, k)`, `l` is unchanged, `s` is `min(m, k)`**.
