The given code modifies the variable `c` by adding `s * (l[i] + t)` to its current value. Let's break down the changes:

- `c` was initially `s * (2 * l[i] + t)`.
- After executing the line `c += s * (l[i] + t)`, `c` becomes `s * (2 * l[i] + t) + s * (l[i] + t)`.
- This simplifies to `c = s * (2 * l[i] + t + l[i] + t)`.
- Further simplification gives us `c = s * (3 * l[i] + 2 * t)`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is `2 * s`; `n` must be greater than 1; `m` and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` now being `k - 2 * s`; `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `s` is `min(m, k)`; `c` is `s * (3 * l[i] + 2 * t)`; `i` is 2.**
