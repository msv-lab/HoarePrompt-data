The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The variables `t`, `c`, and `i` are not modified in this snippet, and `l` remains unchanged as well.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `t` will be the cumulative sum of `s` over all iterations, `c` will be the cumulative sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` over all iterations, `k` will be reduced by the cumulative sum of `s` over all iterations, `i` will be `n`, `m`, `n`, `l` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.**

In simpler terms, `n`, `m`, and `k` have been updated to the values provided by the input, while the other variables retain their initial states.
