The code snippet `c += s * (l[i] + t)` updates the value of `c` based on the current values of `s`, `l[i]`, and `t`. The values of `m`, `k`, `n`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged.

- `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.
- `l[i]` is the element at index `i` in the list `l`.
- `t` is initially 0.
- `c` is initially 0 and gets updated by adding `s * (l[i] + t)` to it.

Since `t` is 0, the expression simplifies to `c += s * l[i]`.

Therefore, the new value of `c` will be `s * l[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `c` is `s * l[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m`, `k`, and `l` are the values read from the input, `s` is `min(m, k)`**.
