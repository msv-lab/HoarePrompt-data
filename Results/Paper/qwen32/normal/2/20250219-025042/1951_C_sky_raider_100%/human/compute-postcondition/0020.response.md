The value of `t` is incremented by `s`. Given the initial state, `t` was originally `2 * s`. After the operation `t += s`, `t` becomes `2 * s + s`, which simplifies to `3 * s`.

Other variables remain unchanged. Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is `3 * s`; `n` must be greater than 1; `m` and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` now being `k - 2 * s`; `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `s` is `min(m, k)`; `c` is `s * (3 * l[i] + 2 * t)`; `i` is 2.**
