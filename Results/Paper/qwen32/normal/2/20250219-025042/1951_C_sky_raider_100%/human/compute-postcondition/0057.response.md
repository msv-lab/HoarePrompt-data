The code snippet `c += s * (l[i] + t)` updates the value of `c` by adding the product of `s` and the sum of `l[i]` and `t` to its current value.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `m` is the second input integer
- `k` is the third input integer
- `t` is 0
- `c` is 0
- `i` is initially set to `n`
- `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input
- `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`

After executing the code snippet:
- `c` is updated to `c + s * (l[i] + t)`. Since `t` is 0, this simplifies to `c + s * l[i]`.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `i`, `l`, `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `t` is 0, `c` is `s * l[i]`, `i` is `n`, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.**
