The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, which is the loop variable for the `for` loop. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `tc` and the range it iterates over, which is defined by `t`.

At the end of the last iteration, `tc` would have taken on the value of the last completed iteration. Since the loop iterates from `0` to `t-1`, if the last completed iteration was for `tc = k`, then the next iteration would be for `tc = k + 1`.

Therefore, to prepare for the next iteration, we simply increment `tc` by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`. If `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, then `mexsize` remains the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`. Otherwise, `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize` and represents the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`. `tc` is incremented by 1**.

Since the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `maxsize`, `mexsize`) do not appear in the loop head and are not modified by the loop itself, they remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`; `tc` is incremented by 1**.

To be more precise, if `tc` was `k` at the end of the last iteration, now `tc` should be `k + 1`.
