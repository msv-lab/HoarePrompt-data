The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `mexsize` to the value 1. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `maxsize`. 

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `mexsize` is 1.**
