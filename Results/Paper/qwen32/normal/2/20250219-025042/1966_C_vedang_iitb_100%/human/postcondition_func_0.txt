The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers. For each test case, it determines the smallest missing positive integer (MEX) in the list and compares it with the maximum value in the list. Based on this comparison, it prints 'Alice' if the MEX is even and greater than the maximum value, or if the MEX is odd and less than or equal to the maximum value; otherwise, it prints 'Bob'.
