The code increments the value of `mexsize` by 1. Given the initial state, `mexsize` was 1, so after the increment, `mexsize` becomes 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `maxsize`, and `sz` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` is 2, and the current value of `sz` is 1.**
