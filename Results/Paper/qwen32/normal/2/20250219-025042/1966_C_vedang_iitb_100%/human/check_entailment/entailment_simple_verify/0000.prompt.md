You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

Output

    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it correctly implements the described game logic.

### Problem Analysis:
The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing stones from piles. The key to winning is to force the opponent into a position where they cannot make a move. The strategy revolves around the concept of the Nim-sum (XOR-sum) of the pile sizes. If the Nim-sum is zero at the start of a player's turn, that player is in a losing position if the opponent plays optimally.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program seems to be attempting to determine the winner based on a different approach involving `mexsize` (minimum excluded value), which is not directly related to the Nim-sum strategy. Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of piles and their respective stone counts.
2. **Finding Maximum and Minimum Excluded Value (`mexsize`)**: It calculates the maximum pile size and iterates through the sorted pile sizes to find the smallest number that is not present in the list (this is the `mexsize`).
3. **Determining the Winner**: Based on the parity of `mexsize` and its comparison with `maxsize`, the program decides the winner.

### Issues with the Program:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic based on the Nim-sum strategy. Instead, it relies on an incorrect heuristic involving `mexsize`. This heuristic does not guarantee the correct determination of the winner for all possible configurations of piles.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine the winner, the program should compute the Nim-sum of the pile sizes. If the Nim-sum is zero at the start of Alice's turn, she is in a losing position; otherwise, she is in a winning position.

### Correct Implementation:
Here is a correct implementation of the game logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nim_sum = 0
        for stones in a:
            nim_sum ^= stones
        if nim_sum == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly determine the winner for all possible configurations of piles. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program uses an incorrect heuristic (`mexsize`) to determine the winner instead of using the Nim-sum strategy, which is the correct approach for this type of game.
