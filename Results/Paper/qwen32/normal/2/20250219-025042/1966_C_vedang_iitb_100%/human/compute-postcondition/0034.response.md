The given code snippet increments the value of `mexsize` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `maxsize`, `tc`, `sz`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `tc` is `tc + 1`. `sz` is the next element in the list `a`. If `sz` equals `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is 2; otherwise, `mexsize` remains 1. `mexsize` is `mexsize + 1`.** 

In simpler terms, `mexsize` is now one more than its previous value, while all other variables retain their original states.
