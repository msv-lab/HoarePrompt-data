`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an integer input representing the number of test cases. This input value is between 1 and 32, inclusive. The precondition about the strings for each test case remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32, and for each of the `t` test cases, there is a string of length 5 consisting solely of the characters 'A' and 'B'. All `t` strings are distinct.**
