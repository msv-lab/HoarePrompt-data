### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Task**: The task requires determining which character ('A' or 'B') appears most frequently in each of `t` test cases, where each test case consists of a string of length 5 made up of 'A's and 'B's.

2. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. It then iterates through each test case, reading a string `s` of length 5.

3. **Counting Characters**: For each string `s`, the program initializes two counters, `ac` and `bc`, to zero. It then iterates through each character in the string:
   - If the character is 'A', it increments `ac`.
   - Otherwise, it increments `bc`.

4. **Determining the Most Frequent Character**: After counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string, the program compares the two counts:
   - If `ac` (the count of 'A's) is greater than `bc` (the count of 'B's), it prints 'A'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'B'.

5. **Edge Cases**: 
   - When the counts are equal (i.e., `ac == bc`), the program defaults to printing 'B'. This is a potential issue because the problem does not specify what to do when the counts are equal. However, based on the provided example, the program seems to be expected to handle this case by choosing 'B' when counts are equal.

6. **Output**: The program outputs the most frequent character for each test case, separated by newlines.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the most frequent character in each test case string. It handles the input as specified and produces the correct output based on the given examples. Therefore, the correctness of the program is true.

**Correctness: True**
