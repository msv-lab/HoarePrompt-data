Output State: **`ac` is either 1 or 2, `bc` is either 0 or 1, `t` remains unchanged, `q` is `q + 1`, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `s`. If `i` is 'A', then `ac` was 1 and is now 2, and `bc` is 0; otherwise, `ac` was 0 and is now 1, and `bc` is 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ac` is incremented by 1. If `i` was 'A', `ac` changes from 1 to 2, and `bc` remains 0. If `i` was not 'A', `ac` changes from 0 to 1, and `bc` remains 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
