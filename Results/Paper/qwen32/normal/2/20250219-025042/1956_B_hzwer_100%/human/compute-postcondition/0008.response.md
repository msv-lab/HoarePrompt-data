The code increments the value at index `x` in the list `cnt` by 1. Given the initial state, `x` is the next element in the list `a`. Therefore, the value at `cnt[x]` increases by 1.

Output State: **`input` holds a valid integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is `t`; `a` is a list of integers with at least one element; `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers where `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1; `x` is the next element in the list `a` and `cnt[x]` has been incremented by 1.**
