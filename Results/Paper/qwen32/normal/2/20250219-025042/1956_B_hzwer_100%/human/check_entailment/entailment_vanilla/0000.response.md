Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The game involves two players, you and Nene, who each receive `n` cards from a deck of `2n` cards. Each card has a number from `1` to `n`, and each number appears exactly twice in the deck. Players take turns placing their cards on the table. A player earns a point if they place a card that matches a card already on the table.

The objective is to determine the maximum number of points you can earn, assuming Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

### Key Observations

1. **Card Distribution**: Since each number from `1` to `n` appears exactly twice, and each player gets `n` cards, it means that for every number `x` in your hand, there is a corresponding card with the same number in Nene's hand.
2. **Points Scoring**: You score a point when you place a card that matches a card already on the table. This implies that if you have a pair of cards with the same number, you can score a point by playing one of them after Nene has played the other.
3. **Optimal Play**: Nene will play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. However, the problem simplifies because the key factor is how many pairs you can form and play optimally.

### Strategy

- **Counting Pairs**: For each unique number `x` in your hand, count how many times it appears. If a number appears twice in your hand, you can potentially score a point by playing one of them after Nene has played the other.
- **Calculating Points**: For each number `x` that appears twice in your hand, you can score 1 point. Therefore, the total number of points you can score is the number of numbers that appear twice in your hand.

### Program Analysis

The provided program correctly implements this strategy:

1. **Reading Input**: It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n` and the list of `n` integers representing the cards in your hand.
2. **Counting Occurrences**: It uses a list `cnt` to count the occurrences of each number in your hand.
3. **Calculating Points**: It calculates the number of points by summing up `max(0, x - 1)` for each count `x` in `cnt`. This effectively counts the number of numbers that appear twice (since `max(0, 2 - 1) = 1` and `max(0, 1 - 1) = 0`).
4. **Output**: It prints the calculated points for each test case.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can score, assuming Nene plays optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
