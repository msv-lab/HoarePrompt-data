### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning using the annotated version and the problem description.

#### Problem Analysis Recap

1. **Game Setup**: There are `2n` cards, with each integer from `1` to `n` appearing exactly twice. Each player gets `n` cards.
2. **Objective**: Maximize your score by placing cards that match cards already on the table.
3. **Nene's Strategy**: Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.
4. **Key Insight**: The key to scoring points is having pairs of cards in your hand. Each pair can contribute to one point if played optimally.

#### Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of `n` integers representing the cards in your hand.

2. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - A list `cnt` of size `n+1` is initialized to zero.
   - For each card `x` in your hand, `cnt[x]` is incremented.

3. **Calculating Points**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to zero.
   - It iterates over the `cnt` list and adds `max(0, x - 1)` to `ans` for each count `x`.
     - If `x` is `2`, `max(0, 2 - 1)` is `1`, indicating a pair.
     - If `x` is `1`, `max(0, 1 - 1)` is `0`, indicating no pair.
     - If `x` is `0`, `max(0, 0 - 1)` is `0`, which is irrelevant since `cnt[0]` is never updated.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated points for each test case.

#### Annotations Validation

- **Initialization**: `cnt` is correctly initialized to zero for each test case.
- **Counting**: The loop correctly increments the count for each card in your hand.
- **Point Calculation**: The logic `max(0, x - 1)` correctly identifies pairs and sums them up.

#### Verification Against Example

Let's verify the program against the provided example:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `4`, `1 1 2 3`
   - `cnt`: `[0, 2, 1, 1, 0]`
   - Points: `max(0, 2 - 1) + max(0, 1 - 1) + max(0, 1 - 1) + max(0, 0 - 1) = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1`
   - Output: `1`

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `8`, `7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5`
   - `cnt`: `[0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]`
   - Points: `max(0, 1 - 1) + max(0, 1 - 1) + max(0, 0 - 1) + max(0, 1 - 1) + max(0, 2 - 1) + max(0, 0 - 1) + max(0, 1 - 1) + max(0, 2 - 1) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 2`
   - Output: `2`

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `8`, `7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6`
   - `cnt`: `[0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1]`
   - Points: `max(0, 1 - 1) + max(0, 1 - 1) + max(0, 1 - 1) + max(0, 2 - 1) + max(0, 1 - 1) + max(0, 1 - 1) + max(0, 1 - 1) + max(0, 1 - 1) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1`
   - Output: `1`

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `3`, `1 2 3`
   - `cnt`: `[0, 1, 1, 1]`
   - Points: `max(0, 1 - 1) + max(0, 1 - 1) + max(0, 1 - 1) = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0`
   - Output: `0`

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - Input: `1`, `1`
   - `cnt`: `[0, 1]`
   - Points: `max(0, 1 - 1) = 0`
   - Output: `0`

All outputs match the expected results from the example, confirming the program's correctness.

### Final Evaluation

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can score, assuming Nene plays optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
