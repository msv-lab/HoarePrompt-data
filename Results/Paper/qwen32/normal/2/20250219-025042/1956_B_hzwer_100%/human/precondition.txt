t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. a is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and n inclusive, and each integer from 1 through n appears in the list a at most 2 times. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
