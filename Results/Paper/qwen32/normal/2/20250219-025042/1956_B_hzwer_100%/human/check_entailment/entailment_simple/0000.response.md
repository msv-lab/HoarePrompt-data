### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We have `2n` cards, with each integer from `1` to `n` appearing exactly twice.
- Cards are distributed between two players, each receiving `n` cards.
- Players take turns placing their cards on the table.
- A player scores a point if they place a card that matches a card already on the table.
- Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.
- We need to determine the maximum number of points you can achieve if you also play optimally.

#### Key Observations:
- For each integer `x` that appears twice in your hand, you can score at most one point because:
  - You place the first card of `x`, which doesn't score a point.
  - If Nene hasn't placed the other card of `x` yet, you can place the second card of `x` and score a point.
- If an integer `x` appears only once in your hand, you can't score a point with it because:
  - You place the card, but since there's no matching card on the table, you don't score.
- Therefore, the maximum number of points you can score is equal to the number of integers that appear twice in your hand.

#### Solution Analysis:
- The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand.
- It initializes a count array `cnt` to keep track of how many times each integer appears in your hand.
- It then calculates the maximum number of points you can score by counting how many integers appear twice (`max(0, x - 1)` for each integer `x` in `cnt`).
- Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

#### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the solution with the provided example:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `n = 4`, `a = [1, 1, 2, 3]`
   - Count array: `cnt = [0, 2, 1, 1, 0]`
   - Points: `max(0, 2-1) + max(0, 1-1) + max(0, 1-1) + max(0, 0-1) = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1`
   - Output: `1`

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `n = 8`, `a = [7, 4, 1, 2, 8, 8, 5, 5]`
   - Count array: `cnt = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]`
   - Points: `max(0, 1-1) + max(0, 1-1) + max(0, 0-1) + max(0, 1-1) + max(0, 2-1) + max(0, 0-1) + max(0, 1-1) + max(0, 2-1) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 2`
   - Output: `2`

The solution correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can score for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can score under optimal play conditions.

**Correctness: True**
