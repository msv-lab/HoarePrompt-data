Output State: **`input` holds a valid integer `t` where 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is `t`; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers; `ans` is `max(0, x - 1) + max(0, x - 1)`; `x` is the last element of `cnt`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` has been updated to be the sum of its previous value (`max(0, x - 1)`) and `max(0, x - 1)` again, where `x` is the last element of the list `cnt`. All other variables remain unchanged.
