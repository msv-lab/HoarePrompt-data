Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of cards each player receives, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n at most 2 times. The total number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is provided at the start, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The variable `input` holds the read line from standard input.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = [0] * (n + 1)
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] += 1
    ans = 0
    for x in cnt:
        ans += max(0, x - 1)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `input` holds a valid integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is `t`; `a` is a list of integers; `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers where each `cnt[x]` represents the number of times `x` appears in the list `a`; `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: ans is 1, n is 4, a is [1, 2, 2, 3], cnt is [0, 1, 2, 1, 0].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
