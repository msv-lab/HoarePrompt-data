The code reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Given that `input` holds a valid integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `n` is initially assigned the value of `t`, the only change is the creation of the list `a` from the input.

Output State: **`input` holds a valid integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is `t`; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each part to an integer.**
