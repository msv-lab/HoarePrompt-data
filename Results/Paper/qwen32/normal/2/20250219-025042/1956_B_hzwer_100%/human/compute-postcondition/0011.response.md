To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes the list `a` and updates the `cnt` list. The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `a` and increments `cnt[x]` by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `input` holds a valid integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is set to `t`.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each part to an integer.
- `cnt` is initialized as a list of `t + 1` zeros.

The loop will iterate over each element in `a`, and for each element `x`, it will increment `cnt[x]` by 1. This means that after all iterations, `cnt[x]` will hold the number of times `x` appears in the list `a`.

After all iterations are completed, the final output state will be:
- `input` remains the same (a valid integer `t`).
- `n` remains the same (`t`).
- `a` remains the same (the list of integers).
- `cnt` is updated such that `cnt[x]` contains the count of occurrences of `x` in the list `a`.

Thus, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`input` holds a valid integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is `t`; `a` is a list of integers; `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers where each `cnt[x]` represents the number of times `x` appears in the list `a`.**

In simpler terms, the `cnt` list will reflect the frequency of each integer in the list `a`.
