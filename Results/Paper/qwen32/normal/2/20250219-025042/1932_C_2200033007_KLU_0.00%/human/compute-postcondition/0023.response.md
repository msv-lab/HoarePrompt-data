To determine the final state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes the input based on the given conditions. The loop iterates over each character in the string `s` and appends elements from the list `a` to the list `b` either from the left (`l`) or the right (`r`) end of `a`, depending on whether the character is 'L' or 'R'.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `b` starts as an empty list.
   - `l` starts at 0 (leftmost index of `a`).
   - `r` starts at `n-1` (rightmost index of `a`).

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each character in `s`:
     - If the character is 'L', append `a[l]` to `b` and increment `l`.
     - If the character is 'R', append `a[r]` to `b` and decrement `r`.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop runs `n` times, once for each character in `s`.

After all iterations, `b` will contain all elements of `a` in the order determined by the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`. Specifically:
- All elements chosen by 'L' will appear in the order they are encountered from the left side of `a`.
- All elements chosen by 'R' will appear in the order they are encountered from the right side of `a`.

Thus, the final state of `b` will be a permutation of `a` based on the directions specified in `s`.

### Final Output State

Output State: **`b` contains all elements of `a` in the order determined by the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`; `l` is `n` if all elements were taken from the left, otherwise it is the position after the last 'L' was processed; `r` is `-1` if all elements were taken from the right, otherwise it is the position before the last 'R' was processed.**

In simpler terms, `b` will have all elements of `a` rearranged according to the 'L' and 'R' instructions in `s`, and `l` and `r` will reflect the final positions after processing all instructions.
