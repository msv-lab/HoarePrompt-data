#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4. s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: `b` contains all elements of `a` in the order determined by the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`; `l` is `n` if all elements were taken from the left, otherwise it is the position after the last 'L' was processed; `r` is `-1` if all elements were taken from the right, otherwise it is the position before the last 'R' was processed.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: `b` contains all elements of `a` in the order determined by the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`; `l` is `n` if all elements were taken from the left, otherwise it is the position after the last 'L' was processed; `r` is `-1` if all elements were taken from the right, otherwise it is the position before the last 'R' was processed; `ans` is a list containing the cumulative products of elements from the end of `b` to the start; `p` is the product of all elements in `b`.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the reversed list of cumulative products of elements from the end of `b` to the start.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes an integer `n`, an integer `m`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'. It constructs a new list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the direction specified by `s`. It then calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` from the end to the start and returns this list in reverse order.
