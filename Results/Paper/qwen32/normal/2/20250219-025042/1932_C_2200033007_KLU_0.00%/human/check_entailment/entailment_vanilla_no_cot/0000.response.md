Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Here's why:

1. The program incorrectly processes the commands and calculates the product remainders.
   - It should calculate the product of all elements in the array `a` at each step and then take the remainder modulo `m`.
   - Instead, the program creates a new list `b` containing elements based on the commands ('L' or 'R'), and then calculates the product of elements in the reverse order of `b`. This does not reflect the intended logic of removing elements from the original array `a` as per the commands.

2. The program does not update the array `a` according to the commands ('L' or 'R') to reflect the removal of elements.
   - For each command, the program should compute the product of the current elements in `a`, take the remainder modulo `m`, and then remove the appropriate element from `a`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    result = []
    product = 1
    for num in a:
        product = (product * num) % m
    for command in s:
        result.append(product)
        if command == 'L':
            product = (product * pow(a.pop(0), m-2, m)) % m
        else:
            product = (product * pow(a.pop(), m-2, m)) % m
    print(*result)
```

This corrected version maintains the product of the current elements in `a` and updates it according to the commands. It also uses modular inverse (`pow(a, m-2, m)`) to efficiently divide out the removed element from the product. Note that this assumes `m` is prime; if `m` is not prime, a different approach would be needed to handle division under modulo. However, given the constraints, this approach should work correctly.
