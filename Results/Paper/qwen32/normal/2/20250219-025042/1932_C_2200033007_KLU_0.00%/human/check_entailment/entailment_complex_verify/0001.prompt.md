You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the reversed list of cumulative products of elements from the end of `b` to the start.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes an integer `n`, an integer `m`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'. It constructs a new list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the direction specified by `s`. It then calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` from the end to the start and returns this list in reverse order.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step against the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
- We need to process a sequence of commands ('L' or 'R') on an array `a` of length `n`.
- For each command, we must first output the remainder of the product of all elements of the current array `a` modulo `m`.
- If the command is 'L', we remove the leftmost element of the array.
- If the command is 'R', we remove the rightmost element of the array.
- This process continues until the array is empty.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program has two main parts:
1. It reads the input and processes each test case.
2. It uses a function `func_1` to compute the required remainders.

#### Function `func_1` Breakdown:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `b = []`: This list is intended to store the elements of `a` in the order they are removed.
   - `l = 0` and `r = n - 1`: These pointers are used to track the leftmost and rightmost elements of `a` respectively.
   
2. **Building List `b`:**
   - For each command in `s`, it appends either the leftmost or rightmost element of `a` to `b` and adjusts the pointers `l` and `r` accordingly.
   
3. **Calculating Remainders:**
   - `ans = []`: This list will store the remainders of the product of elements in `b` modulo `m`.
   - `p = 1`: This variable keeps track of the running product.
   - The loop iterates over `b` in reverse order, updating the product `p` and appending the remainder (`p % m`) to `ans`.

4. **Returning Results:**
   - The function returns `reversed(ans)`, which should give the remainders in the correct order.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Product Calculation:**
   - The product `p` is calculated using the elements of `b` in reverse order, but the problem requires the product of the current state of `a` before any removals.
   - The current implementation calculates the product of the elements in the order they were removed, which is incorrect.

2. **Incorrect Output Order:**
   - The function returns the remainders in reverse order due to the `reversed(ans)` call, which is also incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
- We need to calculate the product of the current state of `a` before removing any element.
- We can maintain a running product and adjust it as elements are removed.
- We should output the remainders in the correct order.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
