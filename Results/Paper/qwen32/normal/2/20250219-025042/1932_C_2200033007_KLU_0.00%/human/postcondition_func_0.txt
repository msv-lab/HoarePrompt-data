The function `func_1` takes an integer `n`, an integer `m`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'. It constructs a new list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the direction specified by `s`. It then calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` from the end to the start and returns this list in reverse order.
