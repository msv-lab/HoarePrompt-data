The value of `r` is decremented by 1. The values of `n`, `i`, and `b` remain unchanged except for `r`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is unchanged; `b` has an additional element `a[r]` appended to it; `r` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is unchanged; `b` has an additional element `a[r]` appended to it; `r` is decreased by 1.**
