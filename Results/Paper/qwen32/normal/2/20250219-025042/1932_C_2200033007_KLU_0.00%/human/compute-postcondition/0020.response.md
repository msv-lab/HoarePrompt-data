The code snippet `b.append(a[r])` appends the element at index `r` of list `a` to list `b`. This operation modifies list `b` by adding one more element to it, but does not affect the values of `n` or `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `i` is `i + 2` (This seems to be a misstatement, as `i` cannot be defined in terms of itself like this in an initial state. We'll assume `i` has some value, say `i`, and it remains unchanged unless explicitly modified.)

After executing the code snippet, the only change is that list `b` now contains one additional element, which is `a[r]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is unchanged; `b` has an additional element `a[r]` appended to it.**
