The code snippet `ans.append(p)` appends the value of `p` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` already contains one element `p`, which is the next element in the reversed list `b` multiplied by `v`. After appending `p` again, `ans` will now contain two identical elements, both equal to `p`.

Output State: **`b` contains at least one element, `l` is `n` if all elements were taken from the left, otherwise it is the position after the last 'L' was processed, `r` is `-1` if all elements were taken from the right, otherwise it is the position before the last 'R' was processed, `ans` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `p`, `p` is the next element in the reversed list `b` multiplied by `v`.**
