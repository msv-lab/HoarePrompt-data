The code snippet `tmp += x` increments the value of `tmp` by the value of `x`. Since `x` is the next element in the list `a`, `tmp` will now hold its previous value plus the value of `x`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `tmp`. All other variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is `max(0, tmp)`, `tmp` is `tmp + x`, `n` is the first integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from input where 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is the new list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of all elements in the new list `a`, `ans` is `(((s + t_initial) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t_initial * (2^(k-1) - 1)) % MOD`, `x` is the next element in the list `a`**.
