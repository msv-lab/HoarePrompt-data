Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an integer read from the input; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `MOD` is 1000000007.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
    s = sum(a)
    t, tmp = 0, 0
    for x in a:
        tmp += x
        if tmp < 0:
            tmp = 0
        t = max(tmp, t)
    ans = ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD
    for i in range(k - 1):
        t *= 2
        t %= MOD
        ans += t
        ans %= MOD
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is greater than or equal to 1; `t` is `(maximum subarray sum of `a` * 2^(k-1)) % 1000000007; `tmp` is 0; `n` is an integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer read from input where 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `MOD` is 1000000007; `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `ans` is `(((s + t_initial) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t_initial * (2^(k-1) - 1)) % MOD`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is `(2^(k-1) * t) % MOD`, `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last contiguous subarray with non-negative sums, `n` is the first integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from input where 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is the new list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of all elements in the new list `a`, `ans` is `(s + t * (2^k - 1)) % MOD`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: - `T` remains greater than or equal to 1.
- `t` becomes `max_subarray_sum * (2^(k-1)) % MOD`.
- `tmp` remains 0.
- `n` remains the first integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `k` remains the second integer read from input where 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` remains the new list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.
- `MOD` remains 1000000007.
- `s` remains the sum of all elements in the new list `a`.
- `ans` becomes `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t * (2^k - 1) % MOD) % MOD`.
- `x` remains the last element in the list `a`.
- `i` will be `k-1` after the loop finishes.

Output State:




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
