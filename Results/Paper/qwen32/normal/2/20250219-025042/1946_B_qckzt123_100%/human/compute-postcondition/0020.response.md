The code snippet sets `tmp` to 0. This change affects the variable `tmp` only, while all other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1; `t` is `max(tmp, max(tmp + a[j], 0))`; `tmp` is 0; `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `MOD` is 1000000007; `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `x` is `a[j]`, the next element in the list `a`.**
