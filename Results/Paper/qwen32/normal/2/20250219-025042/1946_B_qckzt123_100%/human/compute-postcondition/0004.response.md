The given code snippet reads a line of input from standard input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. 

Given the initial state, the values of `T`, `t`, `n`, `k`, and `MOD` remain unchanged. The only variable that gets updated is `a`, which now holds the list of integers read from the input.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `MOD` is 1000000007.**
