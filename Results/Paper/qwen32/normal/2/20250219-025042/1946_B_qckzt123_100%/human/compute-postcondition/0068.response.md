The given code snippet modifies the variable `ans` by adding the value of `t` to it. Since `ans` was initially calculated as `(s + t) % MOD`, after executing `ans += t`, the new value of `ans` becomes `(s + t + t) % MOD` or `(s + 2 * t) % MOD`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `T` remains greater than or equal to 0.
- `t` remains the maximum value of `tmp` encountered during the loop multiplied by 2, then taken modulo `MOD`.
- `tmp` remains the cumulative sum of the last contiguous subarray with non-negative sums.
- `n` remains the first integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `k` remains the second integer read from input where 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` remains the new list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.
- `MOD` remains 1000000007.
- `s` remains the sum of all elements in the new list `a`.
- `ans` is now `(s + 2 * t) % MOD`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is the maximum value of `tmp` encountered during the loop multiplied by 2, then taken modulo `MOD`, `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last contiguous subarray with non-negative sums, `n` is the first integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from input where 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is the new list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of all elements in the new list `a`, `ans` is `(s + 2 * t) % MOD`.**
