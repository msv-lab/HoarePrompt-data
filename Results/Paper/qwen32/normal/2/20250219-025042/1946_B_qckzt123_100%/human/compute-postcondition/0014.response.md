The code snippet `tmp += x` increments the value of `tmp` by the value of `x`. Given that `x` is the next element in the list `a`, the new value of `tmp` will be the original value of `tmp` plus `x`.

Here's the updated state:

- `T` is still greater than or equal to 1.
- `t` is still `max(tmp, 0)`, but since `tmp` has changed, `t` may also change depending on the new value of `tmp`.
- `tmp` is now `tmp + x`.
- `n` and `k` remain unchanged as integers read from input.
- `a` remains the same list of `n` integers.
- `MOD` remains 1000000007.
- `s` (the sum of all elements in the list `a`) remains unchanged.
- `x` remains the next element in the list `a`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1; `t` is `max(tmp + x, 0)`; `tmp` is `tmp + x`; `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `MOD` is 1000000007; `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `x` is the next element in the list `a`.**
