Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:

The goal is to maximize the sum of an array `a` after performing exactly `k` operations. Each operation allows us to select any contiguous subarray of `a`, compute its sum, and insert this sum anywhere in the array.

### Key Observations:

1. **Maximizing the Sum:** To maximize the sum of the array, we should focus on adding the largest possible sums from subarrays. The best strategy involves repeatedly adding the maximum positive subarray sum (which can be found using Kadane's algorithm) to the array.
   
2. **Initial Sum:** Start with the initial sum of the array `s`.

3. **Maximum Subarray Sum:** Use Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray `t`. This value represents the best possible addition we can make to the array in each operation.

4. **Operations:** For each operation, add the current value of `t` to the array's sum. Since we are allowed up to `k` operations, the sum will be incremented by `t` initially, then `2*t`, then `4*t`, and so on, doubling each time until `k` operations are performed.

5. **Modulo Operation:** Since the result can be very large, all operations should be performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Program Analysis:

Let's go through the code to see if it correctly implements the above logic:

```python
import sys

def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, k) = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
        a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
        s = sum(a)
        (t, tmp) = (0, 0)
        for x in a:
            tmp += x
            if tmp < 0:
                tmp = 0
            t = max(tmp, t)
        ans = ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD
        for i in range(k - 1):
            t *= 2
            t %= MOD
            ans += t
            ans %= MOD
        print(ans)
```

1. **Reading Input:** The program reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
   
2. **Initial Sum Calculation:** It calculates the initial sum of the array `s`.
   
3. **Finding Maximum Subarray Sum (`t`):** It uses a variant of Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray `t`. This is done by iterating through the array and maintaining a running sum `tmp`, resetting it to 0 whenever it becomes negative, and updating `t` to the maximum value of `tmp` encountered.
   
4. **Calculating Final Answer:**
   - It initializes `ans` as `(s + t) % MOD`.
   - For each of the remaining `k-1` operations, it doubles `t` (modulo \(10^9 + 7\)) and adds it to `ans` (also modulo \(10^9 + 7\)).
   
5. **Output:** Finally, it prints the computed `ans` for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the strategy outlined above. It efficiently finds the maximum subarray sum and uses it to maximize the array's sum over `k` operations, taking care to handle large numbers using modulo arithmetic.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
