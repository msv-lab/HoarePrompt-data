Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer; `case` is the input string; `i` is incremented by 1. If `num2` is greater than 10000, `op` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `op` is set to 4; `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`; `b` is the sorted list of integers derived from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 4 if `num2` is less than or equal to 10000, `median` is `b[ma]` before the last increment, and `new_median` is `b[ma]` after the last increment, which is `median + 4`.**
