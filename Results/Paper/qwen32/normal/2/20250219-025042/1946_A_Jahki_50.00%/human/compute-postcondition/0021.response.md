Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer that is less than or equal to 10000; `case` is the input string; `op` is 1; `b` is the sorted list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case` except `b[ma]` which is now `b[ma] + 1`; `median` is `b[ma]`; `new_median` is `b[ma] + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `op` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
