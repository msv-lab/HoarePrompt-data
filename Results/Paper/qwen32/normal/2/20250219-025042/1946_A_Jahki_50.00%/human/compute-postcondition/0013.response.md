The code calculates `ma` as `int(num2 / 2) - 1`. Given that `num2` is an even integer less than or equal to 10000, `int(num2 / 2)` will be an integer, and subtracting 1 will yield another integer.

Let's denote the value of `num2 / 2` as `k`. Since `num2` is even, `k` will also be an integer. Thus, `ma` will be `k - 1`.

Given these details, the Output State will include the new value of `ma` while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer that is less than or equal to 10000 and `num2` is even; `case` is the input string; `op` is 0; `b` is the sorted list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`; `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1`.**
