The code snippet provided only reads an input integer and assigns it to `num2`. None of the other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, the only change is the assignment of `num2` to the value provided by the input. All other variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer; `case` is the input string; `op` is 0 if `num2` is greater than 10000, otherwise `op` is the total number of iterations the loop ran; if `num2` is less than or equal to 10000, `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`, `b` is the fully sorted list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case` with `b[ma]` incremented until `new_median > median`, `median` is the value of `b[ma]` before the last increment, and `new_median` is the value of `b[ma]` after the last increment, which is greater than `median`; `i` is incremented by 1**.
