Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer that is less than or equal to 10000; `case` is the input string; `op` is 0; `b` is the sorted list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`; `median` is `b[ma]`; `new_median` is `median`.
Code of the loop:
while new_median <= median:
    b[ma] += 1
    op += 1
    b = sorted(b)
    new_median = b[ma]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer that is less than or equal to 10000; `case` is the input string; `op` is 1; `b` is the fully sorted list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1 and placed in the correct sorted position; `median` is `b[ma]`; `new_median` is `b[ma]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer that is less than or equal to 10000; `case` is the input string; `op` is 2; `b` is the fully sorted list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1 and placed in the correct sorted position; `median` is `b[ma]` + 1; `new_median` is `b[ma]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer that is less than or equal to 10000; `case` is the input string; `op` is 3; `b` is the fully sorted list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case` with `b[ma]` incremented by 2 and placed in the correct sorted position; `median` is `b[ma] + 2`; `new_median` is `b[ma]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
