The code snippet provided is simply reassigning the value of `b[ma]` to `new_median`. Since `new_median` already holds the value of `b[ma]` as per the initial state, this operation does not change the value of `new_median`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with respect to the variables mentioned.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers parsed from the input string `case`; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer; `case` is the input string; `i` is `i + 1`; `op` is 3; `b` is the sorted version of `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 3; `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`; `median` is `b[ma] - 1`; `new_median` is `b[ma]`**
