The code snippet `case = input()` reads an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `case`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, or `num2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `num` must be greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer; `case` is the input string.**
