The code appends a new input value to the list `a`. Initially, `a` contains two elements: the first element is `n` (an integer between 2 and 2 · 10^5), and the second element is another input value. After executing the code, `a` will have three elements: the original `n`, the second input value, and the third input value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is a list containing three elements: the first is `n`, the second is the first input value, and the third is the new input value; `_` is 2.**
