The given code snippet only initializes the variable `y` to 0. None of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `s`, or `x`) are modified.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is a list containing two elements, the first being the first input value and the second being the second input value; `s` is an empty list; `x` is 0; `y` is 0.**
