To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how many times the loop will run. The loop runs for `_ in range(2)`, meaning it will execute exactly 2 times regardless of the value of `n`.

Here's the breakdown of the loop's behavior:

- **Iteration 1**: The first input value is appended to the list `a`.
- **Iteration 2**: The second input value is appended to the list `a`.

After these 2 iterations, the loop terminates because the range is set to 2.

Therefore, the final state of the list `a` will contain exactly two elements: the first and the second input values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is a list containing two elements, the first being the first input value and the second being the second input value.**
