The code appends another input value to the list `a`. Initially, `a` contains one element, which is the input value `n`. After the code executes, `a` will contain two elements: the original `n` and the new input value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is a list containing two elements, the first being `n` and the second being the new input value; `_` is 1.**
