The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `x`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is a list containing two elements, the first being the first input value and the second being the second input value; `s` is an empty list; `x` is 0.**
