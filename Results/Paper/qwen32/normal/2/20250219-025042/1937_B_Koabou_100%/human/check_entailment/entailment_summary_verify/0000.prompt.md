You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is
\mathtt{11000} . There is only one path that yields this string:

            y = i
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
    else:
        s = a[0] + a[1][n - 1]
        x = n - 1
    t = 1
    for i in range(y, x):
        if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
    print(s, sep='')
    print(t)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. For each test case, it constructs a new string `s` by combining parts of the two input strings based on specific conditions and prints this string. It also prints an integer `t`, which is typically `1` unless a specific subsequence condition is met within a certain range of indices.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all possible cases to find the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Incorrect Path Construction**: The program attempts to construct the lexicographically smallest string by making decisions based on the values in the grid. However, the logic for constructing the path is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle scenarios where the optimal path involves switching rows multiple times or staying in the same row.

2. **Incorrect Counting of Paths**: The program attempts to count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string. However, the logic for counting these paths is also flawed. The program incorrectly assumes certain conditions for counting paths, which may not hold true for all inputs.

Let's consider a specific counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Counterexample Input:**
```
1
5
01010
10101
```

**Expected Output:**
```
00000
16
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- The lexicographically smallest string is `00000`, which can be achieved by alternating between the two rows.
- There are 16 different paths that yield this string.

**Actual Output from the Program:**
- The program will likely output a different string and an incorrect count because it does not correctly handle the alternating pattern required to achieve the smallest lexicographical string.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all cases correctly.
