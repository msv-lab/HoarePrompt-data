The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `y`, and `x`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]`
- `x` is unchanged
- `y` is unchanged
- `i` is `i + 1`

The loop condition is `for i in range(y, x):`, which means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `x`.

Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust `i` to reflect the start of the next iteration. Thus, `i` should be set to its value at the end of the previous iteration before it was incremented.

State at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` needs to be decremented by 1 to reflect the start of the current iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`s` is `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `i` is `i`**
