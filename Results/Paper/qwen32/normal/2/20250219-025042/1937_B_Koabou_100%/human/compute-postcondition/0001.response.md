The code snippet provided reads an integer `n` from the input. This integer represents the length of two binary strings that will follow in each test case. The variable `a` is mentioned as an empty list, but it is not modified by the given code snippet.

Since only the reading of `n` is performed, the value of `n` will be updated to the integer read from the input, while the list `a` remains unchanged and still holds its initial state as an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is an empty list.**
