#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), followed by two binary strings of length n, representing the top and bottom rows of the 2 × n grid respectively. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: `n` is an integer read from the input (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is a list containing two elements, the first being the first input value and the second being the second input value.
    s = []
    x = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1':
            y = i
        
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: `s` is `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]` and `x` is `i` if the loop breaks at iteration `i` due to `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'`. Otherwise, `s` is `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]` and `x` is `n - 1`. `y` holds the last index where `a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1'` was true, or 0 if never met.
    t = 1
    for i in range(y, x):
        if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: `s` is `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]`, `x` is `n - 1` or the value set by the break condition, `y` is unchanged, `t` is `1`.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: s (where s is a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:])
    print(t)
    #This is printed: 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. For each test case, it constructs a new string `s` by combining parts of the two input strings based on specific conditions and prints this string. It also prints an integer `t`, which is typically `1` unless a specific subsequence condition is met within a certain range of indices.
