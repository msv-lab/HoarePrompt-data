In this task, we need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop. The loop head contains the variable `_` and the range `2`. Since the loop runs exactly twice (`for _ in range(2)`), we need to consider the iteration count.

Given:
- State at the end of the previous iteration: `n` is an integer read from the input (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is a list containing one element, which is the input value.

The loop runs for a fixed number of times (2 iterations). The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate over the range, and it doesn't affect the state of `n` or `a`.

Let's break down the iterations:
1. First iteration: `_` takes the value 0.
2. Second iteration: `_` takes the value 1.

Since we are asked for the state at the start of the next iteration, and the loop runs only twice, there is no "next iteration" after the second one. However, if we were to consider the state right before the second iteration starts, we would have:

- After the first iteration, `_` was 0.
- Before the second iteration starts, `_` will be 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the second (and final) iteration would be:
State: **`n` is an integer read from the input (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is a list containing one element, which is the input value; `_` is 1**

If you meant to ask for the state right after the loop finishes (which is not another iteration but the state after the loop), then the state would simply be:
State: **`n` is an integer read from the input (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is a list containing one element, which is the input value**

Since the question asks for the state at the start of the next iteration, and there is no next iteration, the most appropriate answer based on the provided format would be the state right before the loop ends, which is the start of the second iteration:

State: **`n` is an integer read from the input (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is a list containing one element, which is the input value; `_` is 1**
