Postcondition: **`n` is an integer read from the input (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is a list containing two elements, the first being the first input value and the second being the second input value; `s` is an empty list unless `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'`, in which case `s` is `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]`; `x` is 0 unless `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'`, in which case `x` is `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `y` is `i` if `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'`, otherwise `y` remains 0.**
