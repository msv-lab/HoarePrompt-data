The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust this variable for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the loop statement `for i in range(1, n):`, the loop iterates over the range starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` had some value, and for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, provided it is still less than `n`.

From the problem description, we know:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³ (this does not change).
- `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴ (this does not change).
- The sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1} (this does not change).
- `I` and `R` are lambda functions for reading input (these do not change).
- `g` is 0 (this does not change based on the loop head).
- `v1` is the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'<'` (this does not change based on the loop head).
- `prev` is `i` if `r` was `'>'`, otherwise `prev` remains unchanged (this does not change based on the loop head).
- `r` is the input string (this does not change based on the loop head).

The only variable that needs adjustment is `i`. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 4.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, the sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'<'`, `prev` is `i` if `r` was `'>'`, otherwise `prev` remains unchanged, and `r` is the input string, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To generalize, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.
