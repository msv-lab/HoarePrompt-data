The given code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call does not alter any variables or their values; it merely flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the standard output immediately.

Given this, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `v2`, `r`, `prev`, `v1`) are modified by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `i` is n-2, `v2` is n-1, `r` is the newly read input from the current iteration. If `r` equals '>', `prev` is set to `n-1`. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0. `v1` is the largest index j for which the input `r` was '<'.**
