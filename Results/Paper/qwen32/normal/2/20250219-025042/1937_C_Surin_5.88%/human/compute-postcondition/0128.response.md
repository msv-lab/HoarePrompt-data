To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze how the variables evolve with each iteration of the loop.

### Loop Analysis

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`. In each iteration:
- `v2` is set to the current value of `i`.
- The program prints a query and flushes the output.
- It reads the input `r`.
- If `r` is `<`, `v1` is updated to `v2`.

### Initial State Recap
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³ (unchanged).
- `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴ (unchanged).
- `g` is 0 (unchanged).
- `v1` is 0 (initially).
- `prev` is the last index i for which the input r was '>' (unchanged).
- `kp` is incremented by 1 (unchanged).
- `v2` is n-1 (initially, but changes in each iteration).
- `r` is the input string from the last iteration (changes in each iteration).
- `i` is n (initially, but changes in each iteration).

### Final Iteration
After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `n`. The variable `v1` will hold the largest index `j` for which the input `r` was `'<'` during the loop iterations. This is because `v1` is updated to `v2` (which is `i`) whenever `r` is `'<'`.

### Final Output State
- `t` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `i` is `n`.
- `v2` is `n-1` (from the last iteration).
- `r` is the result of the last input read.
- `v1` is the largest index `j` for which the input `r` was `'<'`.

### Conclusion
The final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `i` is n, `v2` is n-1, `r` is the newly read input from the last iteration, and `v1` is the largest index j for which the input r was '<'.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `i` will be `n`, `v2` will be `n-1`, `r` will be the last input read, and `v1` will be the highest index where the comparison resulted in `'<'`.
