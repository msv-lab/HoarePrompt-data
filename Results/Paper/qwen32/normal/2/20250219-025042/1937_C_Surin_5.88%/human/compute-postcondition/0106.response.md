To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the `for` loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
```

This means that the loop will iterate over the variable `i` starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n`. Therefore, the key variables to consider are `i` and `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³
- `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴
- The sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`
- `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers
- `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is 0
- `prev` is the last index `i` for which the input `r` was '>'
- `kp` is incremented by 1
- `v2` is `n-1`
- `r` is the input string from the last iteration
- `i` is `n`

For the loop to execute, the value of `i` must be set to 1 (the starting point of the range), and `n` must be at least 2 (since the range is from 1 to `n`, and `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute even once).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- Set `i` to 1
- Ensure `n` is at least 2 (which is already given in the problem statement)

No other variables in the loop head need adjustment since they are not part of the loop's range specification.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `i` is 1**
