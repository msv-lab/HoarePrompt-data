The code snippet provided reads a new input into the variable `r`. This input can be either '>' or '<'. The value of `r` will affect the value of `prev` but does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `v2`, or `v1`.

If `r` is '>', `prev` is set to `n-1`.
If `r` is anything other than '>', `prev` remains 0.

Therefore, the only variable that changes is `r` itself, and `prev` may change based on the value of `r`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `i` is n-2, `v2` is n-1, `r` is the newly read input from the current iteration, `prev` is n-1 if r is '>', otherwise prev is 0, `v1` is the largest index j for which the input r was '<'.**
