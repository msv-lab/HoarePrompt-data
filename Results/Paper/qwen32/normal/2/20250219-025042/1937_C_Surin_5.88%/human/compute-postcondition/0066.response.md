To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t`: An integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
- `n`: An integer between 2 and 10,000 (inclusive), representing the length of a permutation sequence.
- `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}`: A permutation of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}.
- `I`: A lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers.
- `R`: A lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it.
- `g`: Initialized to 0.
- `v1`: Set to `i` if `r` is `'<'`, otherwise remains 0.
- `prev`: The largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'>'`.
- `kp`: Incremented by 1 if `r` is `'<'`, otherwise remains unchanged.
- `v2`: Set to `i`.
- `r`: An input string.
- `i`: Incremented by 1.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `v1` is either `i` if `r` is `'<'`, otherwise it remains 0.
- `v2` is always set to `i`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the exact value of `i` depends on how many times the loop has run and the value of `r` in each iteration. However, without specific input values for `r`, we can only describe `v1` and `v2` in terms of `i`.

### Determining the Values:
- If `r` is `'<'` at any point, `v1` will be set to the current value of `i` at that point.
- If `r` is never `'<'`, `v1` remains 0.
- `v2` is always set to the current value of `i`.

### Conclusion:
The output will depend on the value of `i` and whether `r` was ever `'<'`. Since we don't have specific input values, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2] (where v1 is i if r was '<' at any point, otherwise 0, and v2 is i)**
