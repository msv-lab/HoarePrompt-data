The code snippet assigns the value of `v2` to `v1`. Given that `v2` is initially set to 2, `v1` will also be set to 2. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `i` is 2, `v2` is 2, `v1` is 2, `r` is the newly read input. If `r` equals '<', then `v1` is set to 1.** 

However, since the code snippet sets `v1` to `v2` (which is 2), the condition "If `r` equals '<', then `v1` is set to 1" does not affect the current state of `v1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `i` is 2, `v2` is 2, `v1` is 2, `r` is the newly read input.**
