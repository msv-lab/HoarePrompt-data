The given code snippet only contains the line `n = int(input())`. This line reads a new integer value from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. 

Since the initial state specifies that `n` is already an integer read from the input, this line effectively overwrites the previous value of `n` with a new integer value read from the input.

Given the constraints, the new value of `n` will also satisfy `2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴`.

The other variables (`t`, `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}`, `I`, `R`, `g`, `v1`, `prev`, `kp`, `v2`, `r`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, the sequence p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1} is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, I is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers, R is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index i for which the input r was '<', `prev` is the last index i for which the input r was '>', `kp` is incremented by 1, `v2` is n-1, `r` is the input string from the last iteration, `i` is n**
