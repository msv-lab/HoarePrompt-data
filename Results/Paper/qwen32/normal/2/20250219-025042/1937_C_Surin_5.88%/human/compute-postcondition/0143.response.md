The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates as long as `i` is less than `n`, starting from `i = 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it equal to `n`. However, since `i` is already `n-1`, incrementing it by 1 would make `i` equal to `n`, which means the loop condition (`i < n`) would no longer be satisfied, and the loop would terminate.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be set to a value less than `n-1`. Since the previous iteration had `i` as `n-1`, the next logical value for `i` to ensure the loop continues is `n-2`.

Given the constraints and the requirement to only adjust the loop head variables (`i` and `n`), the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `i` is n-2, `v2` is n-1, `r` is the newly read input from the current iteration. If `r` equals '>', `prev` is set to `n-1`. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0. `v1` is the largest index j for which the input `r` was '<'.**
