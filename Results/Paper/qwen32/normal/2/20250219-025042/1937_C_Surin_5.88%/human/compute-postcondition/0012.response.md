Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, the sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i`, `v2` is `i`, `r` is the input string and `r` equals `<`.**

Explanation: The value of `v1` was updated to be equal to `v2`. Since the initial value of `v2` is `i`, `v1` now also holds the value `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
