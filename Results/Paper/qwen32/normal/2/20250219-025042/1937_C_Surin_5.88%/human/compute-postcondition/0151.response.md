The provided code snippet only contains `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the console. This operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Therefore, none of the variables `t`, `n`, `i`, `v2`, `r`, `v1`, or `prev` are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `i` is `n`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the newly read input from the last iteration, `v1` is the largest index `j` for which the input `r` was '<', `prev` is the largest `i` for which `r` was '>'**.
