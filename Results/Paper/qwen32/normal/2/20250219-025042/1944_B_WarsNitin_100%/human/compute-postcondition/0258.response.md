Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is either 0 or the value of `req`, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicates of elements from `b` where consecutive elements are equal, `ans2` now includes two occurrences of `c[i]`, `req` remains the same, and `q` remains the same.**

Natural Language Explanation: The only change is that `ans2` now includes an additional occurrence of `c[i]`, making it so that `c[i]` appears twice in `ans2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
