To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000;
- `n` is an integer greater than 2;
- `k` is `req - 2` if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, otherwise `k` is 0 if the original `k` was 0, or twice its original value minus 2 if `b[n - 2]` equals `b[n - 1]`, or twice its original value otherwise;
- `a` is a list of integers;
- `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`;
- `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end;
- `ans1` contains the last element of `b` three times followed by `b[i]` if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, otherwise it contains the last element of `b` twice if `b[n - 2]` equals `b[n - 1]`, or is an empty list;
- `ans2` is an empty list;
- `req` is equal to the new value of `k`;
- `l` is an empty list if `b[0]` equals `b[1]` and `b[n - 2]` equals `b[n - 1]`, otherwise `l` contains the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, and the last element of `b` (`b[n - 1]`) if `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`. Additionally, if `b[i] != b[i + 1]`, then `l` includes `b[i]` as its last element.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n-2`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.
2. **Variable `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value (let's call it `i_prev`). For the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.
3. **Variable `n`**: The variable `n` does not change during the loop iterations, so it remains the same.

### Conclusion:

Given that `i` was `i_prev` at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration will have `i` incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `k` is `req - 2` if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, otherwise `k` is 0 if the original `k` was 0, or twice its original value minus 2 if `b[n - 2]` equals `b[n - 1]`, or twice its original value otherwise; `a` is a list of integers; `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end; `ans1` contains the last element of `b` three times followed by `b[i]` if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, otherwise it contains the last element of `b` twice if `b[n - 2]` equals `b[n - 1]`, or is an empty list; `ans2` is an empty list; `req` is equal to the new value of `k`; `l` is an empty list if `b[0]` equals `b[1]` and `b[n - 2]` equals `b[n - 1]`, otherwise `l` contains the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, and the last element of `b` (`b[n - 1]`) if `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`. Additionally, if `b[i] != b[i + 1]`, then `l` includes `b[i]` as its last element; `i` is `i_prev + 1`**.
