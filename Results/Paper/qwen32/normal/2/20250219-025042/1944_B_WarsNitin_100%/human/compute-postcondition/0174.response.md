The given code snippet appends the element at index `i` of list `c` to the list `ans2`. The values of other variables remain unchanged unless specified.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is either 0, -2, or -4, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains additional elements if there were consecutive duplicates in `b` within the range [1, n-2], `ans2` includes `c[i]` and the newly added `c[i]`, `req` remains the same, `q` remains the same, `l` contains elements from `b` that are not part of consecutive duplicates and are not the last element in their group, `i` is incremented by 1. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Natural Language Explanation: The list `ans2` now includes an additional element which is `c[i]`. All other variables retain their original values and conditions.
