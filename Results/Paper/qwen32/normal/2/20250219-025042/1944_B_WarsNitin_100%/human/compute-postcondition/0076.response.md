The given code snippet appends `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 3, `c[i]` refers to `c[3]`.

Since `ans2` initially contains `c[0]`, `c[1]`, `c[2]`, and now also `c[3]` if `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, appending `c[3]` unconditionally means `ans2` will now include `c[3]` regardless of whether `c[i] == c[i - 1]` or not.

No other variables are modified by this line of code, so their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is either -4 or retains its original value minus 2 if `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicates of consecutive elements from `b` up to the point where `k` becomes 0 or the loop completes, `ans2` contains `c[0]`, `c[1]`, `c[2]`, and now also `c[3]`, `req` equals the final value of `k`, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not part of a consecutive duplicate sequence and are not the first or last element if they are repeated, `i` is 3. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
