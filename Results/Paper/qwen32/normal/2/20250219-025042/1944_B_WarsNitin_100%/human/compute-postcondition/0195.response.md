Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` is -2, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains additional elements if there were consecutive duplicates in `b` within the range [1, n-2] plus the first element of `l` and the element at index 1 of `l` and now also includes `l[2]`, `ans2` contains pairs of consecutive duplicates found in `c` up to the point where `k` becomes 0 or the loop ends plus the first element of `l` and the element at index 1 of `l` and now also includes `l[2]`, `req` remains the same, `q` remains the same, `l` must contain at least one element, `i` is 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element at index 2 of `l` to `ans2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
