To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Here's the analysis:

- The loop variable `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
- The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

From the provided state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` remains the same (not relevant to the loop head).
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `k` is either 0 or twice the second integer from the input minus 2 (decreased by 2 if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`).
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `b` contains the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order.
- `c` contains the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end sorted in ascending order.
- `ans1` is either an empty list, a list containing the `n-1`th element of `b` twice, or a list containing the `n-1`th element of `b` twice followed by `b[i]` twice if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`.
- `ans2` is an empty list.
- `req` equals `k`.
- `q` is incremented by 1.
- If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, `l` contains the element `b[i]` appended to it.

Since the only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, we only need to adjust these:

- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value that allowed the loop to continue.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- `n` must remain the same since it defines the range of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is either 0 or twice the second integer from the input minus 2 (decreased by 2 if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`), `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` contains the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` contains the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end sorted in ascending order, `ans1` is either an empty list, a list containing the `n-1`th element of `b` twice, or a list containing the `n-1`th element of `b` twice followed by `b[i]` twice if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` equals `k`, `q` is incremented by 1, and if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, `l` contains the element `b[i]` appended to it, `i` is incremented by 1**
