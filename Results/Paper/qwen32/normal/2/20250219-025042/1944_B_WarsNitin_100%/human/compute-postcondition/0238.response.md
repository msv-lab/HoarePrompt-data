The code snippet provided appends the element at index `i` of list `b` to list `l`. Given the initial state, the only change will be to list `l`, which will now include the element `b[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is -2 if it was 0 initially and `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, otherwise `k` remains unchanged if `b[i] == b[i - 1]` or `k` is 0 if it was 0 initially and `b[i] != b[i - 1]`, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is `a[n:]` sorted in ascending order, `ans1` is determined based on the conditions given, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is twice the second integer from the input, `q` is 1, `l` includes `b[i]`.**
