Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `k` is `k - 2` if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, otherwise `k` is 0 if the original `k` was 0, or twice its original value minus 2 if `b[n - 2]` equals `b[n - 1]`, or twice its original value otherwise; `a` is a list of integers; `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end; `ans1` contains the last element of `b` three times followed by `b[i]` if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, otherwise it contains the last element of `b` twice if `b[n - 2]` equals `b[n - 1]`, or it contains `b[i]` if `ans1` was previously empty, and now it also contains `b[i]` as its last element; `ans2` is an empty list; `req` is equal to the new value of `k`; `l` is an empty list if `b[0]` equals `b[1]` and `b[n - 2]` equals `b[n - 1]`, otherwise `l` contains the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, and the last element of `b` (`b[n - 1]`) if `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`. Additionally, if `b[i] != b[i + 1]`, then `l` includes `b[i]` as its last element; `i` is `i + 1`. If `k` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `ans1` now includes `b[i]` as its last element.** 

In simpler terms, the list `ans1` now includes the element `b[i]` appended to it. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state except for `ans1`.
