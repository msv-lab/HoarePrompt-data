Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end; `ans1` is an empty list if `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`, otherwise it contains the last element of `b` twice; `ans2` is an empty list; `k` is now twice its original value if `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`, otherwise it is twice its original value minus 2; `req` is equal to `k`; `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, and the last element of `b` (`b[n - 1]`) if `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`, otherwise `l` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
        l.append(b[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `k` is `req - 2` if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, otherwise `k` is 0 if the original `k` was 0, or twice its original value minus 2 if `b[n - 2]` equals `b[n - 1]`, or twice its original value otherwise; `a` is a list of integers; `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end; `ans1` contains the last element of `b` three times followed by `b[i]` if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, otherwise it contains the last element of `b` twice if `b[n - 2]` equals `b[n - 1]`, or is an empty list; `ans2` is an empty list; `req` is equal to the new value of `k`; `l` is an empty list if `b[0]` equals `b[1]` and `b[n - 2]` equals `b[n - 1]`, otherwise `l` contains the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, and the last element of `b` (`b[n - 1]`) if `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`. Additionally, if `b[i] != b[i + 1]`, then `l` includes `b[i]` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `k` is `k - 2` if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, otherwise `k` is 0 if the original `k` was 0, or twice its original value minus 2 if `b[n - 2]` equals `b[n - 1]`, or twice its original value otherwise; `a` is a list of integers; `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end; `ans1` contains the last element of `b` three times followed by `b[i]` if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, otherwise it contains the last element of `b` twice if `b[n - 2]` equals `b[n - 1]`, or it contains `b[i]` if `ans1` was previously empty, and now it also contains `b[i]` as its last element; `ans2` is an empty list; `req` is equal to the new value of `k`; `l` is an empty list if `b[0]` equals `b[1]` and `b[n - 2]` equals `b[n - 1]`, otherwise `l` contains the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, and the last element of `b` (`b[n - 1]`) if `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`. Additionally, if `b[i] != b[i + 1]`, then `l` includes `b[i]` as its last element; `i` is `i_prev + 1`. If `k` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `k` is decreased by 2 if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, otherwise `k` is 0 if the original `k` was 0, or twice its original value minus 2 if `b[n - 2]` equals `b[n - 1]`, or twice its original value otherwise; `a` is a list of integers; `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end; `ans1` contains the last element of `b` three times followed by `b[i]` if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, otherwise it contains the last element of `b` twice if `b[n - 2]` equals `b[n - 1]`, or it contains `b[i]` if `ans1` was previously empty, and now it also contains `b[i]` as its last element; `ans2` is an empty list; `req` is equal to the new value of `k`; `l` is an empty list if `b[0]` equals `b[1]` and `b[n - 2]` equals `b[n - 1]`, otherwise `l` contains the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, and the last element of `b` (`b[n - 1]`) if `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`. Additionally, if `b[i] != b[i + 1]`, then `l` includes `b[i]` as its last element; `i` is `i + 1`. If `k` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, `ans1` now includes `b[i]` as its last element. If `b[i] != b[i + 1]`, `l` now includes `b[i]` as its last element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
