To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans2)` statement, let's break down the information given in the initial state:

1. **Variables and their states:**
   - `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `q` remain unchanged and their exact values are not specified.
   - `k` is set to 0.
   - `ans1` and `ans2` are constructed based on specific rules involving `b`, `c`, and `l`.

2. **Construction of `ans2`:**
   - `ans2` includes all pairs of consecutive equal elements from `c` until `k` is exhausted.
   - Since `k` is 0, no elements from `c` will be added to `ans2` because the process of adding elements stops once `k` is exhausted.
   - Additionally, `ans2` includes the first `|k|/2` elements of `l`. Since `k` is 0, `|k|/2` is also 0, meaning no elements from `l` will be added to `ans2`.

Given these points, `ans2` will be an empty list because no elements are added to it under the conditions specified.

Thus, the `print(*ans2)` statement will print nothing because `ans2` is empty.

Output: **(nothing)**
