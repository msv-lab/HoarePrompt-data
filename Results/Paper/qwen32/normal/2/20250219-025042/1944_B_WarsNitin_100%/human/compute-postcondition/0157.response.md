Postcondition: **`t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is either 0 or retains its original value, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains additional elements if there were consecutive duplicates in `b` within the range [1, n-2], `ans2` remains an empty list, `req` remains the same, `q` remains the same, `l` contains elements from `b` that are not part of consecutive duplicates and are not the last element in their group. If `k` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
