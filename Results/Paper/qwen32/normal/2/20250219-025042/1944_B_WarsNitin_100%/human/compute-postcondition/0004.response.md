The code snippet `b = a[:n]` creates a new list `b` that contains the first `n` elements of the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the original list `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `a`.**
