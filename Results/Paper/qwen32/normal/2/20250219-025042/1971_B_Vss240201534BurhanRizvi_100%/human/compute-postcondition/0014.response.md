Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is a string with a length greater than 1. If all characters in `s` are identical, then `s` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is the string `s` rotated such that the first character of `s` is moved to the end. Otherwise, `s2` remains unchanged.**
