Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    s = input()
    if len(s) == 1:
        print('No')
    elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
        print('No')
    else:
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        if s == s2:
            s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
        print('Yes')
        print(s2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is a string. If the length of `s` is 1, it remains unchanged. If the length of `s` is greater than 1, `s` remains unchanged unless all characters in `s` are identical, in which case `s` remains unchanged, or if `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is the string `s` rotated such that the first character of `s` is moved to the end, otherwise `s2` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is the string provided by the user input. If `s` has a length of 1, no changes are made to `s`. Otherwise, if `s` consists of the same character repeated more than once, no changes are made to `s`. If `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` remains as the string formed by taking all characters of `s` starting from the second character to the end, followed by the first character of `s`. Otherwise, `s2` is a string that contains all characters from `s` but in a random order.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is the string provided by the user input. If `s` has a length of 1, no changes are made to `s`. If `s` consists of the same character repeated more than once (`len(set(s)) == 1` and `len(s) > 1`), no additional changes are made to `s`. Otherwise, `s` is either the string `s` rotated to the left by one position or remains unchanged if `s` is not equal to `s2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
