Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `s` is a string with a length greater than 1.
- The characters in `s` are not all identical.
- `s2` is defined as follows:
  - If `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is the string `s` rotated such that the first character of `s` is moved to the end.
  - Otherwise, `s2` remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet simply outputs the string `'Yes'`. The conditions and definitions provided about `t`, `s`, and `s2` do not affect the execution of this particular `print` statement. The `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables; it directly outputs the string `'Yes'`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not change based on the values of `t`, `s`, or `s2`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Yes**
