Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `s` is a string provided by the user input.
- `s2` is defined based on the condition:
  - If `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` remains as the string formed by taking all characters of `s` starting from the second character to the end, followed by the first character of `s`.
  - Otherwise, `s2` is a string that contains all characters from `s` but in a random order.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('Yes')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `s`, or `s2`. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

### Explanation:
- The value of `t` does not influence the print statement.
- The value of `s` and how `s2` is derived do not affect the print statement because the print statement is hardcoded to output `'Yes'`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `t`, `s`, or `s2`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Yes**
