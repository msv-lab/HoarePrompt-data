The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. This statement does not depend on any variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output will always be the string `'No'`.

Here's the breakdown:

- The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and `s` is a string provided by user input. However, these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'No'`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not change based on the values of `t` or `s`.

Output: **No**
