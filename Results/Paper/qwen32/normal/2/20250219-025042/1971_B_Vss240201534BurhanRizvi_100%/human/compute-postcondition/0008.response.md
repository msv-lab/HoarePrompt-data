Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is a string with a length greater than 1. The characters in `s` are not all identical. `s2` is a string that contains all the characters from `s` in a random order.**

Explanation: The value of `t` remains unchanged. The string `s` remains unchanged in terms of its content and properties. A new string `s2` is created by randomly shuffling the characters of `s`.
