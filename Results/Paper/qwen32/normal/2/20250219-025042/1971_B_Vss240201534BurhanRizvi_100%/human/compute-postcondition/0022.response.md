Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is the string provided by the user input. If `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` remains as the string formed by taking all characters of `s` starting from the second character to the end, followed by the first character of `s`. Otherwise, `s2` is a string that contains all characters from `s` but in a random order.**
