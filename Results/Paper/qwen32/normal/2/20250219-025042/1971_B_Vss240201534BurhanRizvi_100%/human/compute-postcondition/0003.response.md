Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `s` is a string with a length of 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

### Variables and Objects:
- `t`: An integer within the range 1 to 1000. Its exact value does not affect the output of the `print` statement.
- `s`: A string with a length of 1. Its exact value also does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the string `'No'` regardless of the values of `t` and `s`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **No**
