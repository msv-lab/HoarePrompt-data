The code snippet `s2 = s[1:] + s[0]` takes the string `s` and rearranges it such that the first character of `s` is moved to the end of the string, while the rest of the characters are shifted one position to the left.

Given the initial state, `s2` is initially a string containing all characters from `s` in a random order. After executing the code, `s2` is reassigned to a new value based on the transformation described above.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is the string provided by the user input; `s2` is the string formed by taking all characters of `s` starting from the second character to the end, followed by the first character of `s`.**
