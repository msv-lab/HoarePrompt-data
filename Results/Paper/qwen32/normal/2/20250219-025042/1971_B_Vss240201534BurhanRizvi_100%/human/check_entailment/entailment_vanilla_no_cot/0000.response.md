Let's analyze the given program to see if it correctly solves the problem according to the description:

1. **Handling Single Character Strings:**
   - The program checks if the length of the string `s` is 1. If so, it prints 'No' because a single character cannot be rearranged to form a different string.
   - This part is correct.

2. **Handling Strings with All Identical Characters:**
   - The program checks if all characters in the string are identical using `len(set(s)) == 1`. If true, it prints 'No' because rearranging identical characters will always result in the same string.
   - This part is also correct.

3. **Generating a Different Permutation:**
   - For other cases, the program generates a random permutation of the string using `random.sample(s, len(s))`.
   - It then checks if this permutation is the same as the original string. If they are the same, it manually creates a different permutation by moving the first character to the end (`s[1:] + s[0]`).
   - This approach ensures that a different permutation is generated when possible.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints 'Yes' followed by the generated permutation if a different permutation is found.
   - The output format matches the problem requirements.

### Potential Issues:
- **Randomness Dependency:** While the use of `random.sample` generally works, there's a small chance that the random permutation could match the original string, especially for shorter strings. However, the manual adjustment step (`s[1:] + s[0]`) ensures that a different permutation is always produced when possible.
- **Case Sensitivity:** The problem allows outputs like 'yes', 'YES', etc., but the program consistently uses 'Yes'. This is acceptable as per the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all edge cases and produces the expected output format. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
