The code snippet `s = input()` changes the value of `s` from its initial state to whatever string is input by the user. The value of `t` remains unchanged.

Given that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `s` was initially a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, after executing the code `s` will be updated to the new input string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is the string returned by the input function.**
