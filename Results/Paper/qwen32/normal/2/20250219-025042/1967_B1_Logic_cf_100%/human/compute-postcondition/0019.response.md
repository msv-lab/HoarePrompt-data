To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `b`, `n`, and `m`. The loop iterates over `b` starting from 2 up to `min(n, m)` inclusive.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `n` is the first positive integer from the input, converted to an integer, and must be at least 2
- `m` is the second positive integer from the input, converted to an integer, and must be at least 2
- `ans` is `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`
- `T` is `t`

From the loop statement:
```python
for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
We know that `b` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `b` should be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `b` was some value `k`. At the start of the next iteration, `b` will be `k + 1`.

Since `n` and `m` are not modified within the loop head, they remain the same.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `n` is the first positive integer from the input, converted to an integer, and must be at least 2
- `m` is the second positive integer from the input, converted to an integer, and must be at least 2
- `b` is `k + 1` (where `k` is the value of `b` at the end of the previous iteration)
- `ans` is recalculated as `n + (n + b) // (b * b)` using the new value of `b`
- `T` is `t`

However, since we do not know the exact value of `b` at the end of the previous iteration, we can express the state in terms of the increment:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first positive integer from the input converted to an integer and must be at least 2, `m` is the second positive integer from the input converted to an integer and must be at least 2, `b` is incremented by 1, `ans` is `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`, `T` is `t`**
