The code snippet converts the variables `n` and `m` to integers. Given that `n` and `m` are already described as the first and second positive integers from the input, converting them to integers does not change their values since they are already integers.

Therefore, the Output State remains that `t` must be greater than 0, and `n` and `m` remain as the first and second positive integers from the input, respectively.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first positive integer from the input, `m` is the second positive integer from the input.**
