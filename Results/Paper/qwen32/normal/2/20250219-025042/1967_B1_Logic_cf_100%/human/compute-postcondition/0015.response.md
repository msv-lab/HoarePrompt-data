The code snippet converts the strings `n` and `m` into integers. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first positive integer from the input converted to an integer, `m` is the second positive integer from the input converted to an integer, `ans` is the original `ans` plus the sum of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for all `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`, `T` is `t`.**
