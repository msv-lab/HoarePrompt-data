You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, computes a specific value `ans` based on these inputs, and prints `ans` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and compare it against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)
```

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Initialization of `ans`**: The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`. This is incorrect because it assumes that for every \(b\), there is always at least one valid pair \((a, b)\). However, this is not necessarily true for all values of \(b\).

2. **Logic for Counting Pairs**:
   - The loop iterates over \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\).
   - For each \(b\), it adds \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to `ans`. This formula does not correctly account for the condition that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Counterexample:
Let's consider a simple counterexample to demonstrate the issue:
- Input: \(n = 2\), \(m = 2\)
- Expected Output: 3 (Pairs: (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2))
- Program Output: 3 (Based on the current logic, but let's verify the logic)

For \(b = 1\):
- Valid pairs: (1, 1), (2, 1) => 2 pairs

For \(b = 2\):
- Valid pairs: (2, 2) => 1 pair

Total valid pairs: 3

However, the program logic does not correctly compute this. Let's check the logic for \(b = 2\):
- The program adds \((2 + 2) // (2 * 2) = 1\) to `ans`, which is correct for this specific case, but the general logic is flawed.

### General Case:
The program does not correctly handle the general case where \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The provided formula \((n + b) // (b * b)\) does not guarantee the correct count of valid pairs for all values of \(b\).

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for all possible inputs.

**Correctness: False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for all possible values of \(b\). The initialization and the logic for counting pairs are incorrect.
