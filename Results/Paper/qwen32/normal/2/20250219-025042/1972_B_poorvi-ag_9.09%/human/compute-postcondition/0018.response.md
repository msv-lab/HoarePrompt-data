Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is the integer value from input, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", `arr` is the newly input string, if `n` is even, `results` is a list containing the strings 'no' and 'yes'. If `n` is odd, `results` is a list containing the single element `'yes'` if the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D' in `arr`, or the elements `'no'` and `'yes'` if the count of 'U' in `arr` is less than or equal to the count of 'D' in `arr`, `i` is 1**.

Explanation: The `results` list has had `'yes'` appended to it, regardless of the initial conditions regarding the parity of `n` and the counts of 'U' and 'D' in `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
