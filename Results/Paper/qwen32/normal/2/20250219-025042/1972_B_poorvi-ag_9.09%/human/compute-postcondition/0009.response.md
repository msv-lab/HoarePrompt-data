Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 100 and is odd, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", `results` is a list containing the string 'yes', `arr` is the input string, and the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D' in `arr`.**

Explanation: The `results` list now contains the string 'yes', while all other variables retain their initial values.
