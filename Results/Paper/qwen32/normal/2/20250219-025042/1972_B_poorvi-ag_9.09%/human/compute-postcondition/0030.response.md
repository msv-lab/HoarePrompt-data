To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case and updates the `results` list based on the conditions provided.

Here's a summary of the loop behavior:
- For each iteration (each test case), the loop reads an integer `n` and a string `arr` of length `n`.
- If `n` is even, it appends `'no'` to the `results` list.
- If `n` is odd, it compares the counts of 'U' and 'D' in `arr`:
  - If the count of 'U' is greater than the count of 'D', it appends `'yes'` to the `results` list.
  - Otherwise, it appends `'no'` to the `results` list.

Given that `t` represents the total number of test cases, the loop will iterate `t` times, processing each test case as described above.

Let's consider the general form of the final output state:
- The `results` list will contain `t` elements, each determined by the conditions above for each respective test case.

Since we don't have specific values for `t` and the inputs for each test case, we can't provide a concrete list of results. However, we can describe the final state in terms of the structure of the `results` list after all iterations.

### Final Output State Description:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100.
- `results` is a list with `t` elements, where each element is either `'yes'` or `'no'`, depending on whether the corresponding test case met the conditions specified in the loop.

Thus, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **`results` is a list of length `t` where each element is either `'yes'` or `'no'`, determined by the conditions of each test case.**

This means that after all iterations, `results` will contain `t` entries, each reflecting the outcome of the corresponding test case based on the rules provided in the loop.
