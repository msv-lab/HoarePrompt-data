The code snippet assigns the value of `input()` to the variable `arr`. This means `arr` will now hold whatever string is input by the user. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `results` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", `results` is an empty list, `arr` is the input string.**
