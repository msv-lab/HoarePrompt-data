The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`. This line of code reads an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` is already an integer between 1 and 100, but this value is overwritten by the new input.

Since the input value is not specified, we can only say that `n` will now hold whatever integer value is provided by the user, which must be between 1 and 100 inclusive. The other variables (`t`, `s`, and `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", `results` is an empty list**.
