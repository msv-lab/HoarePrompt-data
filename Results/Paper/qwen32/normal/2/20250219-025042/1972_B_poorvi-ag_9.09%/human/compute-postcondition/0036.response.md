Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

- **Initial State**: 
  - `results` is a list of length `t` where `t` is at least 2.
  - Each element in the list `results` is either `'yes'` or `'no'`.
  - `i` is assigned the value of the last element of the list `results`.

- **Code Snippet**:
  ```python
  print(i)
  ```

Given this information, we know that `i` is the last element of the `results` list. Since each element in `results` is either `'yes'` or `'no'`, `i` must also be either `'yes'` or `'no'`.

However, without knowing the specific contents of the `results` list, we cannot determine if `i` is specifically `'yes'` or `'no'`. We only know it will be one of these two values.

Therefore, the output of the `print(i)` statement will be either `'yes'` or `'no'`, depending on the last element of the `results` list.

Output: **'yes' or 'no' (where 'yes' or 'no' is the last element of the results list)**
