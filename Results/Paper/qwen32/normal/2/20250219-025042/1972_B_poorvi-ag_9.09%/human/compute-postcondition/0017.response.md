Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is the integer value from input, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", `arr` is the newly input string, `results` is a list containing either ['no'] or ['yes', 'no'] depending on the initial conditions, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The `results` list initially contains either `['no']` (if `n` is even) or `['yes']` or `['no']` (if `n` is odd, based on the counts of 'U' and 'D'). After executing `results.append('no')`, the list `results` will definitely contain an additional 'no', making it either `['no', 'no']` or `['yes', 'no']`. All other variables remain unchanged.
