Postcondition: **`t` is a specific integer between 1 and 500; `s` is the string input by the user; `count` is the number of transitions in the string `s` minus 1 if `flag` is True, otherwise it remains unchanged; `flag` is True if there is at least one '01' sequence in `s`, otherwise False; `j` is `len(s) - 1` or `len(s) - 2`; `i` is `len(s)`**
