Postcondition: **`t` is a specific integer between 1 and 500; `s` is the same string input by the user; `count` is the total number of transitions between different characters in `s` minus 1 if `flag` is True, otherwise it remains unchanged; `flag` is True if there is at least one occurrence of the substring "01" in `s`; `j` is `len(s) - 1`.**
