Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a specific integer between 1 and 500; `s` is the new string input by the user; `count` is 1; `flag` is False; `j` is 0; `i` is `len(s) + 1`.
Code of the loop:
while j < len(s) - 1:
    if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
        count += 1
        if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
            flag = True
            j += 1
    j += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a specific integer between 1 and 500; `s` is a new string input by the user with a length of at least 2; `count` is 2 if the character at index `j` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `j + 1`, otherwise `count` remains 1; `flag` is True if the character at index `j` of `s` is '0' and the character at index `j + 1` of `s` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False; `j` is 2 if `flag` is True, otherwise `j` is 1; `i` is `len(s) + 1`; the character at index `j` of `s` is '1' if `flag` is True, otherwise it retains its original value; the character at index `j + 1` of `s` is unknown if `flag` is True, otherwise it retains its original value.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is a specific integer between 1 and 500; `s` is a new string input by the user with a length of at least 3 if `j` was 2, otherwise `s` has a length of at least 2; `count` is 2 if `s[j]` equals `s[j + 1]`, otherwise `count` is 3; `flag` is True if the character at index `j` of `s` is '0' and the character at index `j + 1` of `s` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False; `j` is `initial j + 1`; `i` is `len(s) + 1`; the character at index `j` of `s` is '1' if `flag` is True, otherwise it retains its original value; the character at index `j + 1` of `s` is unknown if `flag` is True, otherwise it retains its original value.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is a specific integer between 1 and 500; `s` is a new string input by the user with a length of at least 3 if `j` was 2, otherwise `s` has a length of at least 2; `count` is 4 if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[j + 1]`, otherwise `count` is 3; `flag` is True if the character at index `j` of `s` is '0' and the character at index `j + 1` of `s` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False; `j` is `initial j + 3` if `flag` is True, otherwise `j` is `initial j + 2`; `i` is `len(s) + 1`; the character at index `j` of `s` is '1' if `flag` is True, otherwise it retains its original value; the character at index `j + 1` of `s` is unknown if `flag` is True, otherwise it retains its original value.`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
