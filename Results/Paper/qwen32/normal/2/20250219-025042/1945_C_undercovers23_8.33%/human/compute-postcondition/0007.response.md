The code assigns the value of `n // 2` to the variable `pk`. Since `n` is given to be an odd integer, `n // 2` will result in an integer division, effectively discarding the remainder. This means `pk` will be the integer part of `n` divided by 2.

Given the initial conditions, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains the same odd integer, `a` remains the string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', and `s` remains the input string. The only change is the introduction of `pk` with its calculated value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is the input integer (odd), `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the input string, and `pk` is `n // 2`.**
