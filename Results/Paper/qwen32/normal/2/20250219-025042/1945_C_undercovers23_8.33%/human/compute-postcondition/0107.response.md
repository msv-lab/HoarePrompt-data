To determine the new value of `zero_perc`, we need to evaluate the expression `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`.

Given:
- `zero` is `previous_value_of_zero` + 1 if `s[i]` is '0'.
- `i` is 5.
- `s` is the string "010101", so `s[5]` is '1'.
- Since `s[5]` is '1', `zero` remains `previous_value_of_zero`.
- We don't have the exact value of `previous_value_of_zero`, but we know that `zero` does not change because `s[5]` is '1'.

Let's assume `previous_value_of_zero` is `x`. Therefore, `zero` is `x`.

Now, we can calculate `zero_perc`:
- `zero_perc = math.ceil(x * 100 / (5 + 1))`
- `zero_perc = math.ceil(x * 100 / 6)`

Since we don't have the exact value of `x`, we'll keep it as `x` in our output state.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is 7, `a` is a string of length 6 consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the input string "010101", `pk` is 3, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s` ['0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '1'], `o` is 4 if `s[i]` is '1', otherwise `o` remains 3, `z` is 3, `mini` is 100000000, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / 6)`, `one_perc` is 0, `lst` is [], `i` is 5, and `zero` is `previous_value_of_zero` + 1 if `s[i]` is '0'.**
