The given code snippet increments the variable `zero` by 1. However, `zero` is not defined in the initial state. Since the task requires us to strictly follow the initial state and only update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code, and since `zero` was not initially defined, we cannot provide a specific value for `zero` in the output state. 

However, if we assume that `zero` was intended to be part of the initial state (which it wasn't), the increment operation would simply add 1 to its current value.

Given the instructions, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of all other variables and the presence of the undefined `zero` variable being incremented.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is 7, `a` is a string of length 6 consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the input string "010101", `pk` is 3, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s` ['0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '1'], `o` is 3, `z` is 3, `mini` is 100000000, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is 50, `lst` is [i + 1], `i` is 4, `zero` is incremented by 1.**

Since `zero` was not initially defined, the output state reflects its increment operation without a specific initial value. All other variables remain unchanged.
