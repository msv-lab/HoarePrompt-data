The code appends the value `0` to the list `final`. The value of `c1` remains unchanged as it was initially defined and its condition (being greater than or equal to 50) is still valid.

Output State: **`final` is a list containing one element `[0]`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n` and its value is greater than or equal to 50.**
