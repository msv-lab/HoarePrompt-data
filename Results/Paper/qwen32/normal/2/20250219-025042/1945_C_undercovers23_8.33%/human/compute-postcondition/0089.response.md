Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is 7, `a` is a string of length 6 consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the input string "010101", `pk` is 3, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s` ['0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '1'], `o` is 3, `z` is 3, `lst` is [], `mini` is 100000000. If the current character `s[i]` is '0', then `zero` is 1 and `one` is 0. If the current character `s[i]` is '1', then `zero` is 0 and `one` is 1.**
