The given code snippet appends the variable `elem` to the list `final`. According to the initial state, `final` is initially an empty list `[]`. The variable `elem` is described as an element in the list `lst` such that the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`. Given that `mini` is 0, `pk` is 3, and `lst` is `[1, 3, 5]`, the only element in `lst` that satisfies this condition is `3`. Therefore, `elem` is `3`.

After executing the line `final.append(elem)`, the list `final` will contain the single element `3`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is 7, `a` is a string of length 6 consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the input string "010101", `pk` is 3, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s` ['0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '1'], `o` is 3, `z` is 3, `mini` is 0, `zero` is 3, `one` is 3, `lst` is [1, 3, 5], `final` is [3]**.
