The given code snippet appends `i + 1` to the list `lst`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state. Since `i` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, we can only express that `lst` will have an additional element which is `i + 1`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the updated state will include the list `lst` with one more element. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is 7, `a` is a string of length 6 consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the input string "010101", `pk` is 3, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s` ['0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '1'], `o` is 3, `z` is 3, `lst` is [i + 1], `mini` is 100000000, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is 50, and both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50**.
