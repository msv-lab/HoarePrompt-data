Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a binary string `a` of length `n`. It calculates and prints the earliest position in the string where both the percentage of '0's up to that position and the percentage of '1's from that position to the end are at least 50%. If no such position exists, it prints either `0` or `n` based on the overall majority of '0's or '1's in the string.**
