Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is 7, `a` is a string of length 6 consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the input string "010101", `pk` is 3, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s` ['0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '1'], `o` is 3, `z` is 3, `zero` is 3, `one` is 2, `lst` is [2, 4], `mini` is 1. Regardless of whether `n % 2 == 0` is true or false, the values of all variables remain unchanged.**
