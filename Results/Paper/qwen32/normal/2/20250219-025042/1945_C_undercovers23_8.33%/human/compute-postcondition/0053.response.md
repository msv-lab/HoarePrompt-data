The code appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. Given that `elem` is an element in `lst` such that the absolute difference between `pk` (which is 3) and `elem` is equal to `mini` (which is 1), the possible values for `elem` are 2 or 4. Since `lst` contains both 2 and 4, either could be appended to `final`. However, without loss of generality and based on the given conditions, let's assume `elem` is 2 (as it is the first element in `lst` that satisfies the condition).

After appending `elem` to `final`, `final` will be `[2]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is 6, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the input string "010101", `pk` is `n // 2` which is 3, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s` ['0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '1'], `o` is the count of '1's in `sl` which is 3, `z` is the count of '0's in `sl` which is 3, `zero` is 3, `one` is 2, `lst` is [2, 4], `mini` is 1, `final` is [2]**.
