Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `x` and `y` have the same number of digits; `a` is a list of characters representing the digits of the input number `x` except that if `a[i] > b[i]`, then `a[i]` is now the digit that was originally in `b[i]`; `b` is a list of characters representing the digits of the newly input number `y` except that if `a[i] > b[i]`, then `b[i]` is now the digit that was originally in `a[i]`; `f` is not 0. At index `i`, if `a[i]` was greater than `b[i]`, they are swapped; otherwise, `a[i]` remains greater than or equal to `b[i]`.**
