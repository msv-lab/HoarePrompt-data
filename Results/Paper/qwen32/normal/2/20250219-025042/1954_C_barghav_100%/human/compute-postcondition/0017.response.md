Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `x` and `y` have the same number of digits; `a` is a list of characters representing the digits of the input number `x` and `b` is a list of characters representing the digits of the newly input number `y`. If `f` was originally 0 and `a[i]` was less than `b[i]` for any index `i`, then `a[i]` and `b[i]` are swapped and `f` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `f` is not 0, for each index `i`, if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, then `a[i]` and `b[i]` are swapped. In all other cases, `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**
