Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts no direct parameters but presumably processes `t` test cases where each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers with the same number of digits, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and satisfy the conditions 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `x` and `y`.**
