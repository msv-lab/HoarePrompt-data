Given the initial state, `a` is a list with at least two elements, and `i` is set to 2. The `print` statement is:

```python
print(a[i], end='')
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `a` is a list with at least two elements. Since the exact elements of the list are not specified, we can denote them generally as `a[0]`, `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and so on.
2. The variable `i` is explicitly set to 2.
3. The `print` statement accesses the element at index `i` in the list `a`, which means it will access `a[2]`.
4. The `end=''` argument in the `print` function specifies that nothing should be added after the printed content, meaning no newline character will be appended.

Since the specific elements of the list `a` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the element at index 2 of the list `a`.

Output: **a[2] (where a[2] is the third element of the list a)**
