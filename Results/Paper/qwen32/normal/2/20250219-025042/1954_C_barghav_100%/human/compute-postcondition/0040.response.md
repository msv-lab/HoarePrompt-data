Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list with at least one element.
- `i` is 1.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(a[i], end='')
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the value of `i`:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 1.

2. **Determine the value of `a[i]`:**
   - Since `a` is a list with at least one element, it means `a` could have any number of elements starting from 1.
   - The value at index `i` (which is 1) will be the second element of the list `a`.

3. **Understand the `end=''` parameter:**
   - The `end=''` parameter in the `print` function specifies that there should be no newline character added after the printed value. Instead, it will print the value followed by nothing (an empty string).

Based on the above steps, the `print` statement will output the second element of the list `a` without adding a newline character at the end.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **the second element of the list `a`**
