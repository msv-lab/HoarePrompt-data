Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the annotated states.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to minimize the cost of purchasing `k` tickets over `n` days, given that:
- The price of tickets on day `i` is `a_i`.
- No more than `m` tickets can be purchased on any given day.
- Purchasing `x` tickets on day `i` increases the price of tickets on all subsequent days by `x`.

### Provided Program Analysis:
Here's the provided code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        s = 0
        c = k * k / 2
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)
            k -= s
            c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2
        print(int(c))

func()
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are read.
   - The list `l` of prices `a_i` is read and sorted in ascending order.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `s` is initialized to 0 (though it seems to be used as a temporary variable later).
   - `c` is initialized to `k * k / 2`. This initialization doesn't make sense in the context of the problem and seems arbitrary.

3. **Processing Each Day:**
   - For each day `i`:
     - `s` is set to the minimum of `m` and `k` (the number of tickets left to buy).
     - `k` is decremented by `s`.
     - `c` is updated by adding `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`. The term `s * s / 2` doesn't align with the problem's requirements and seems incorrect.

4. **Output:**
   - The final value of `c` is printed as an integer.

### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Initialization:** The initial value of `c` is set to `k * k / 2`, which has no logical basis in the problem.
- **Incorrect Cost Calculation:** The term `- s * s / 2` in the cost update is incorrect. The cost should simply be `l[i] * s` without any subtraction.
- **Logic Flaw:** The logic of incrementally buying tickets and adjusting the price doesn't correctly simulate the problem's constraints and requirements.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly:
- Sort the list of prices in ascending order.
- Iterate through the sorted list, buying up to `m` tickets each day until `k` tickets are purchased.
- Keep track of the cumulative cost and adjust the price for subsequent days accordingly.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
