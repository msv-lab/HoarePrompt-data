The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `l`. This operation overwrites the previous value of `l`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `l`, which now holds the new list of integers read from the input. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `s`, `c`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` from the last iteration, `c` is the initial value plus the accumulated sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for all iterations, `i` is incremented by 1**.
