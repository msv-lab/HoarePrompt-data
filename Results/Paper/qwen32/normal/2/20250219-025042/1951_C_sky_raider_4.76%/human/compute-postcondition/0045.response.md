The code snippet assigns the value of `k * k / 2` to the variable `c`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `s` is 0, `c` is `k * k / 2`, `i` is 0**.
