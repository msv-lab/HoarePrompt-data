The value of `k` is decremented by `s`. Given that `s` is `min(m, k)`, the new value of `k` will be `k - min(m, k)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `k - min(m, k)`, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `c` is `k * k / 2`, `i` is 0**.
