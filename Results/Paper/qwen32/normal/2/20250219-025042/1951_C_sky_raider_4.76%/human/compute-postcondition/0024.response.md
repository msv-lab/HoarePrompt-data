Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `s` is 0, `c` is the initial value plus the accumulated sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for all iterations, `i` is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been reset to 0, while all other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
