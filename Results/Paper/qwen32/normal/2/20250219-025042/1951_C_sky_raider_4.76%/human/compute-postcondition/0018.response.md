To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider how the variables `s`, `k`, and `c` evolve over the course of the loop's execution. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

### Initial State Recap:
- `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n`: The first integer from the input.
- `m`: The second integer from the input.
- `k`: The third integer from the input.
- `l`: A sorted list of integers read from the input.
- `s`: 0.
- `c`: \( \frac{k \times k}{2} \).

### Loop Iteration Details:
- For each iteration \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\):
  - `s` is set to \( \text{min}(m, k) \).
  - `k` is decremented by `s`.
  - `c` is updated by adding \( l[i] \times s - \frac{s \times s}{2} \).

### Final Output State:
After all \(n\) iterations, the variables will have the following values:

- `t`: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `n`: Remains unchanged as it is the loop's control variable.
- `m`: Remains unchanged as it is used but not modified within the loop.
- `k`: Will be reduced by the sum of `s` across all iterations.
- `l`: Remains unchanged as it is only read from, not modified.
- `s`: Will be the value of \( \text{min}(m, k) \) from the last iteration.
- `c`: Will be the initial value plus the accumulated sum of \( l[i] \times s - \frac{s \times s}{2} \) for all iterations.

### Calculation of `k` and `c`:
- `k` starts at its initial value and gets reduced by `s` in each iteration. Since `s` is \( \text{min}(m, k) \), `k` will eventually reach 0 or a value less than `m`.
- `c` starts at \( \frac{k \times k}{2} \) and gets incremented by \( l[i] \times s - \frac{s \times s}{2} \) for each iteration.

### Final State Description:
- `t` remains the same as initially provided.
- `n` remains the same as initially provided.
- `m` remains the same as initially provided.
- `l` remains the same as initially provided.
- `s` is the value of \( \text{min}(m, k) \) from the last iteration.
- `k` is reduced to a value that is either 0 or less than `m` after all iterations.
- `c` is the initial value plus the accumulated sum of \( l[i] \times s - \frac{s \times s}{2} \) for all iterations.

### Final Output State in Required Format:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the remaining value after all iterations, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` from the last iteration, `c` is the initial value plus the accumulated sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for all iterations.**
