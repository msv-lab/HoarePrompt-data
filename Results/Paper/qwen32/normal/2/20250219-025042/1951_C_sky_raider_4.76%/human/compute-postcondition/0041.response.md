The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The variables `l`, `s`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `s` is the value of `s` in the last iteration, `c` is the cumulative value after all iterations, `i` is 0**.
