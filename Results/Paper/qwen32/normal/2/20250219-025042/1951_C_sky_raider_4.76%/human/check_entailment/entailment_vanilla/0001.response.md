Let's analyze the provided code to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Sorting the Prices**: The code sorts the list of prices `l` in ascending order. This is a good strategy because it allows us to buy tickets at the lowest possible prices first, which minimizes the overall cost.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `s` is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the number of tickets bought on each day.
   - `c` is initialized to `k * k / 2`. This initialization seems incorrect and doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. The variable `c` should represent the total cost, which should start at 0.

3. **Loop Through Days**:
   - The loop iterates through each day `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - Inside the loop, `s` is set to the minimum of `m` (maximum tickets that can be bought per day) and `k` (remaining tickets to be bought). This ensures that we do not buy more tickets than allowed per day or more than we need.
   - `k` is then decremented by `s`, reducing the number of tickets still needed.
   - The cost `c` is updated by adding the cost of buying `s` tickets at the current price `l[i]` minus `s * s / 2`. The subtraction of `s * s / 2` is incorrect and does not align with the problem requirements.

4. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the total cost `c` is printed. Due to the incorrect initialization and update logic, the output will not be correct.

### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Initialization of `c`**: `c` should be initialized to 0, not `k * k / 2`.
- **Incorrect Update of `c`**: The formula `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` is incorrect. It should simply be `l[i] * s` because there is no reason to subtract `s * s / 2`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        cost = 0
        increment = 0
        for price in l:
            if k == 0:
                break
            tickets_to_buy = min(m, k)
            cost += tickets_to_buy * (price + increment)
            k -= tickets_to_buy
            increment += tickets_to_buy
        print(cost)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original code is incorrect due to improper initialization and update of the cost variable `c`.

**Correctness: False**
