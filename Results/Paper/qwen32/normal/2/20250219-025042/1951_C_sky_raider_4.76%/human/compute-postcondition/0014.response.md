To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `m` is the second integer from the input
- `k` is `k - 2 * min(m, k)`
- `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input
- `s` is `min(m, k)`
- `c` is `k * k / 2 + 2 * (l[i] * s - s * s / 2)`
- `i` is `i + 1`

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the loop statement, we know that the loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n-1`. At the end of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

Since the only variable in the loop head that changes is `i`, we need to increment `i` by 1 to get the state at the start of the next iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `t` remains the same
- `n` remains the same
- `m` remains the same
- `k` remains the same (it is calculated once before the loop starts and does not change within the loop)
- `l` remains the same
- `s` remains the same (it is calculated once before the loop starts and does not change within the loop)
- `c` remains the same (it is recalculated in each iteration but its value at the start of the next iteration is not directly relevant to the loop head)
- `i` is incremented by 1

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `k - 2 * min(m, k)`, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `c` is `k * k / 2 + 2 * (l[i] * s - s * s / 2)`, `i` is `i + 1`** 

However, since `i` is incremented by 1, the correct state should reflect this:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `k - 2 * min(m, k)`, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `c` is `k * k / 2 + 2 * (l[i] * s - s * s / 2)`, `i` is `i + 2`** 

But since `c` is recalculated in each iteration and its value at the start of the next iteration is based on the new `i`, we should not include the old `c` value. The correct state focusing on the loop head variables is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`**
