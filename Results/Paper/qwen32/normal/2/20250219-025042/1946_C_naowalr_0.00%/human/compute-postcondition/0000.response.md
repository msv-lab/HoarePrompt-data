The code snippet reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer is likely used to represent some parameter or input for further processing, but it does not affect the existing variables `adj`, `n`, or `k`.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, where each inner list contains the vertices adjacent to the vertex corresponding to its index; `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree; `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= `k` < `n`; `t` is an integer read from the standard input.**
