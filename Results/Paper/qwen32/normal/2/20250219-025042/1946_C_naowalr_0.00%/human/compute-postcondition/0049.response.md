The given code snippet reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This means that the values of `a` and `b` will be updated based on the input, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer read from input, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input, `L` is the final integer value that satisfies the condition, `R` is `L + 1`, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is the last calculated midpoint, `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration, `z` is incremented by 1, `i` is 0.**

In natural language: The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the two integers read from the input. All other variables retain their previous values.
