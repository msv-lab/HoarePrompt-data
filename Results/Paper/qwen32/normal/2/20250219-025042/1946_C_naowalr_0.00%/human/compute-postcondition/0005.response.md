The code reads two integers from the standard input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The values of `adj`, `n`, `k`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of 3 empty lists, `n` is 2, `k` is 1, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the first integer read from input, `b` is the second integer read from input.**
