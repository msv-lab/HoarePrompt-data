The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. Given the initial state, `n` was originally 2 and `k` was originally 1. After executing the code, the values of `n` and `k` will be updated to the new integers read from the input.

Output State: **`adj` is a list where `adj[a]` contains `[b]` and `adj[b]` contains `[a]`; `n` is the first integer read from input; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `a` is the first integer read from input; `b` is the second integer read from input; `L` is the final integer value that satisfies the condition; `R` is `L + 1`; `numCuts` is 0; `x` is the last calculated midpoint; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration; `z` is incremented by 1**.
