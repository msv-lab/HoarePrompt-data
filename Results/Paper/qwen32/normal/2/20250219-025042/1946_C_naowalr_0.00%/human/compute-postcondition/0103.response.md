The given code snippet modifies the adjacency list `adj` by appending `a` to the list at index `b`. This means that the connection between nodes `a` and `b` is being updated to ensure that `b` points back to `a`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `adj`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` includes `b` and the list at index `b` includes `a`; `n` must be at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `L` is 50000; `R` is 50001; `x` is 50000; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `z` is `z + 1`; `i` is `n - 1`; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from input.**

In natural language: The adjacency list `adj` now includes `a` in the list at index `b`, ensuring a bidirectional connection between `a` and `b`. All other variables retain their initial values.
