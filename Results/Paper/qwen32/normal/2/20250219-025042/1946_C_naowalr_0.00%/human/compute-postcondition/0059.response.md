The given code snippet modifies the adjacency list `adj` by appending the value `a` to the list at index `b`. This means that the relationship between nodes `a` and `b` is updated in the graph structure.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `adj`: The list at index `b` now includes `a` as one of its elements, reflecting the bidirectional connection between `a` and `b`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `t`, `L`, `R`, `numCuts`, `x`, `leftover`, `z`, `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` contains `b` (added to its previous contents), and the list at index `b` contains `a` (with `a` newly added); `n` is at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `L` is the final integer value that satisfies the condition; `R` is `L + 1`; `numCuts` is 0; `x` is the last calculated midpoint; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration; `z` is incremented by 1; `i` is 2; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input.**
