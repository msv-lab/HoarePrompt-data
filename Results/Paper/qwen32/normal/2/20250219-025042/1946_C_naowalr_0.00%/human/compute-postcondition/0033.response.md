The code snippet assigns the value of `x` to `L`. Given that `x` is 25001, `L` will now also hold the value 25001. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list where `adj[a]` contains `[b]` and `adj[b]` contains `[a]`; `n` is 2; `k` is 1; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `a` is the first integer read from input; `b` is the second integer read from input; `x` is 25001; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `numCuts` is 0; If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001. Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001, and `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` with `leftover` being less than `x`; `L` is 25001.**
