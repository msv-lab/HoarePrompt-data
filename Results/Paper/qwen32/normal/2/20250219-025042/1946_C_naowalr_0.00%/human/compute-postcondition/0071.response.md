Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the nodes `b` that are directly connected to `a` in the graph; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `L` is 1; `R` is 50001; `numCuts` is 0 or less than `k`; `x` is 50001; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` and is less than `x` if `numCuts` equals `k`; `z` is incremented by 1; `i` is `n-2`.**

Explanation: The value of `R` has been updated to 50001, which is the value of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
