The code snippet updates the value of `x` to be the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001. Therefore, the new value of `x` will be `(1 + 100001) // 2`, which equals `50001`.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the nodes `b` that are directly connected to `a` in the graph; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001; `numCuts` is 0; `x` is 50001; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration; `z` is incremented by 1; `i` is `n-2`.**
