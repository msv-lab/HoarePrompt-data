The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop condition is `i < n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. However, since the loop condition is `i < n - 1`, and `n - 1` is 1, the loop will not execute again if `i` becomes 2.

Therefore, the loop will terminate after this iteration because `i` will no longer satisfy the condition `i < n - 1`.

State: **`adj` is a list where `adj[a]` contains `[b, b]` and `adj[b]` contains `[a, a, a]`; `n` is 2; `k` is 1; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `a` and `b` are the new integers read from input; `i` is 2**
