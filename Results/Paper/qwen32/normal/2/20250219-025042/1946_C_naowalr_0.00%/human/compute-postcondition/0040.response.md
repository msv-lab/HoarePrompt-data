Output State: **`adj` is a list where `adj[a]` contains `[b]` and `adj[b]` contains `[a]`; `n` is 2; `k` is 1; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `a` is the first integer read from input; `b` is the second integer read from input; `x` is `(L + R) // 2`; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `numCuts` is 0; `L` is `(L + R) // 2`; `R` is 1 and `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` with `leftover` being less than `x`.**

Explanation: The value of `L` is updated to be equal to `x`, which is `(L + R) // 2`. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
