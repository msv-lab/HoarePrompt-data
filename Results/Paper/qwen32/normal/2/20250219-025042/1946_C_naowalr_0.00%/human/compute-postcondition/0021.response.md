The code snippet calculates the midpoint of `L` and `R` and assigns it to `x`. Given that `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001, the calculation `(L + R) // 2` results in `(1 + 100001) // 2`, which equals `50001`.

Therefore, the value of `x` is updated to `50001`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list where `adj[a]` contains `[b]` and `adj[b]` contains `[a]`; `n` is 2; `k` is 1; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `a` is the first integer read from input; `b` is the second integer read from input; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001; `numCuts` is 0; `x` is 50001.**
