The code appends the integer `b` to the list at index `a` in the `adj` list. This means that the list at `adj[a]` will now include `b` as one of its elements.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` includes `b`; `n` must be at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `L` is 50000; `R` is 50001; `x` is 50000; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `z` is `z + 1`; `i` is `n-2`; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from input.**
