Output State: **`adj` is a list where `adj[a]` contains `[b, b, b]` and `adj[b]` contains `[a, a, a, a]`; `n` is 2; `k` is 1; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `a` and `b` are the integers read from input; `i` is 2**

Explanation: The list `adj[b]` originally contained `[a, a, a]`. After executing `adj[b].append(a)`, `adj[b]` now contains `[a, a, a, a]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
