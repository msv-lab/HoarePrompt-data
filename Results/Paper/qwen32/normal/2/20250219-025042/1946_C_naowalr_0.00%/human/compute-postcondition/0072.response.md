Postcondition: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the nodes `b` that are directly connected to `a` in the graph; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `x` is 50001; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `z` is incremented by 1; `i` is `n-2`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k`, or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is set to 50001. Otherwise, `R` is set to 50001.**
