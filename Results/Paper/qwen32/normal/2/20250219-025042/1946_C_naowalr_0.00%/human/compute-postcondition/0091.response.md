The code snippet provided reinitializes the `adj` variable to be a list of `n + 1` empty lists. This means that any previous connections stored in `adj` are lost, and now `adj` contains `n + 1` empty lists.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `t`, `L`, `R`, `x`, `leftover`, `z`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists; `n` is the first integer read from input; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `L` is 50000; `R` is 50001; `x` is 50000; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `z` is `z + 1`; `i` is `n-2`.**
