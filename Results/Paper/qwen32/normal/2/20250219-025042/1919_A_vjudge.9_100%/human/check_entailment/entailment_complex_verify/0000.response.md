### Reasoning:

The original assessment provides a detailed analysis of the problem and the program's logic. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step to ensure its accuracy:

1. **Problem Recap**: The game involves Alice and Bob taking turns to either swap wallets or remove a coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a move loses, and both play optimally.

2. **Program Logic**: The program reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets for each test case. It then checks if the absolute difference between the number of coins (`abs(a - b)`) is even or odd. If the difference is even, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice".

3. **Key Insight**:
   - If `a == b`, Alice and Bob will end up with zero coins simultaneously, and since Alice goes first, Bob will make the last move, thus winning.
   - If `a != b`, the player with more coins can always force the other player into a losing position by maintaining an imbalance until the other player is forced to make the last move, thus Alice wins.

4. **Alignment of Logic**:
   - When `abs(a - b)` is even, it implies `a == b` (since the only way the absolute difference can be zero is if `a` and `b` are equal), and the program correctly outputs "Bob".
   - When `abs(a - b)` is odd, it implies `a != b`, and the program correctly outputs "Alice".

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `a` and `b` are equal correctly by checking if the difference is even.
   - It also handles the case where `a` and `b` are not equal correctly by checking if the difference is odd.

6. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations confirm that the program reads the input correctly and processes each test case by calculating the absolute difference and determining the winner based on whether the difference is even or odd.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. This logic ensures that the program works correctly for all possible inputs within the constraints.

**Final: True**
