Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
  - `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
  - The absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even.

- **Code Snippet:**
  ```python
  print('Bob')
  ```

From the initial state, we know several things about the variables `t`, `a`, and `b`:
- `t` is constrained to be between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `a` and `b` are integers.
- The condition `|a - b| % 2 == 0` holds true, meaning the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even.

However, the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `a`, or `b`. It simply prints the string `'Bob'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not change based on the values of the variables.

Output: **Bob**
