Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- The absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('Bob')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, or `i`. It simply prints the string `'Bob'`.

### Output:
Output: **Bob**
