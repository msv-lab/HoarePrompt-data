### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and the original assessment based on the provided annotations and the problem description.

#### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob take turns exchanging wallets and removing one coin from their current wallet.
- The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., whose wallet is empty) loses.
- Both players play optimally.
- Determine who will win given the initial number of coins in each player's wallet.

#### Program Logic:
The program reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets for each test case and determines the winner based on the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins:
- If `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`, it prints "Bob".
- Otherwise, it prints "Alice".

#### Analysis:
The original assessment suggests that:
- If `a == b`, Bob wins because both players will end up with zero coins simultaneously, and Bob makes the last move.
- If `a != b`, Alice wins because she can always force Bob into a losing position by maintaining an imbalance until Bob is forced to make the last move.

However, let's delve deeper into the logic:
- When `a == b`, the absolute difference `abs(a - b)` is indeed `0`, which is even. Therefore, the program correctly outputs "Bob".
- When `a != b`, the absolute difference `abs(a - b)` is odd. Therefore, the program correctly outputs "Alice".

The original assessment aligns with the program's logic and correctly interprets the game rules.

#### Annotations:
The annotations confirm that:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `a` and `b` are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
- The program checks the parity of `abs(a - b)` and prints "Bob" if even and "Alice" if odd.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The annotations support the correctness of the program, and the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
