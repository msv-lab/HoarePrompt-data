### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided solution to ensure its correctness.

#### Game Mechanics Recap:
1. **Players**: Alice and Bob.
2. **Initial Coins**: Alice has `a` coins, Bob has `b` coins.
3. **Turn Order**: Alice goes first, then Bob, and they alternate.
4. **Moves**:
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
   - After choosing, the player removes one coin from their current wallet.
5. **Winning Condition**: The player who cannot make a valid move (both wallets are empty) loses.

#### Strategy Analysis:
The critical insight is the parity (odd/even nature) of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets (`|a - b|`).

- **Even Difference (`|a - b| % 2 == 0`)**:
  - If the difference is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves.
  - This ensures that the difference remains even throughout the game.
  - Eventually, both players will end up with zero coins simultaneously, and since Alice goes first, Bob will be the last to make a move and thus lose.
  
- **Odd Difference (`|a - b| % 2 != 0`)**:
  - If the difference is odd, Alice can force Bob into a losing position.
  - By making the first move, Alice can ensure that the difference becomes even after her move.
  - This puts Bob in the position described above, ensuring Alice wins.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code correctly implements the logic described above:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

- **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
- **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`.
- **Determining the Winner**:
  - It calculates the absolute difference `abs(a - b)`.
  - If the difference is even (`abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`), it prints "Bob".
  - If the difference is odd (`abs(a - b) % 2 != 0`), it prints "Alice".

#### Annotations Validation:
The annotations confirm that:
- `t` is an integer within the specified range.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input for each test case.
- The absolute difference `abs(a - b)` is evaluated for each test case.
- The loop runs `t` times, processing all test cases.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code accurately determines the winner based on the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The original assessment correctly identifies the logic and concludes that the code is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
