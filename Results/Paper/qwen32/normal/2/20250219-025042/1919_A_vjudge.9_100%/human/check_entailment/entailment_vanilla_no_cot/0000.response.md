To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented correctly solves the problem described.

The key observation in this game is that the player who starts with a larger number of coins can always force the game into a state where the other player loses if the difference between the number of coins in their wallets is odd. This is because the player with more coins can always ensure that after each round, the difference in coins remains odd, forcing the opponent into a losing position eventually.

Conversely, if the difference in the number of coins is even, the second player (Bob) can always mirror the moves of the first player (Alice), ensuring that he never faces a situation where he has to make a move when both wallets have zero coins.

Thus, the strategy boils down to checking the parity of the absolute difference between `a` and `b`:
- If `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`, Bob wins.
- Otherwise, Alice wins.

The provided program correctly implements this logic:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
