### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution to verify its correctness.

#### Game Mechanics Recap:
1. **Initial Setup**: Alice starts with `a` coins, and Bob starts with `b` coins.
2. **Turns**: Players alternate turns, starting with Alice.
3. **Actions**:
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
   - After choosing, the player removes one coin from their current wallet.
4. **Winning Condition**: The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., when both wallets have 0 coins) loses.

#### Strategy Analysis:
- **Parity of Coin Difference**: The critical observation is the parity (odd/even nature) of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
  - If `|a - b|` is even, the players can mirror each other's moves, ensuring that the difference remains even. This results in both wallets having zero coins simultaneously, making Bob the winner because Alice goes last.
  - If `|a - b|` is odd, Alice can force Bob into a losing position by making the first move, ensuring that the difference becomes even after her move. Thus, Alice will be the last one to make a valid move and win the game.

#### Provided Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

#### Annotations:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.
- It calculates the absolute difference `abs(a - b)`.
- If the difference is even, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice".

#### Validation Using Annotations:
- **Test Case 1**: `a = 1`, `b = 1`
  - `abs(1 - 1) = 0` (even), so the output should be "Bob".
- **Test Case 2**: `a = 1`, `b = 4`
  - `abs(1 - 4) = 3` (odd), so the output should be "Alice".
- **Test Case 3**: `a = 5`, `b = 3`
  - `abs(5 - 3) = 2` (even), so the output should be "Bob".
- **Test Case 4**: `a = 4`, `b = 5`
  - `abs(4 - 5) = 1` (odd), so the output should be "Alice".
- **Test Case 5**: `a = 11`, `b = 9`
  - `abs(11 - 9) = 2` (even), so the output should be "Bob".
- **Test Case 6**: `a = 83`, `b = 91`
  - `abs(83 - 91) = 8` (even), so the output should be "Bob".
- **Test Case 7**: `a = 1032`, `b = 9307`
  - `abs(1032 - 9307) = 8275` (odd), so the output should be "Alice".
- **Test Case 8**: `a = 839204`, `b = 7281`
  - `abs(839204 - 7281) = 831923` (odd), so the output should be "Alice".
- **Test Case 9**: `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1000000000`
  - `abs(1000000000 - 1000000000) = 0` (even), so the output should be "Bob".
- **Test Case 10**: `a = 53110`, `b = 2024`
  - `abs(53110 - 2024) = 51086` (even), so the output should be "Bob".

The provided code correctly implements the logic based on the parity of the absolute difference between `a` and `b`. All test cases align with the expected outcomes.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
