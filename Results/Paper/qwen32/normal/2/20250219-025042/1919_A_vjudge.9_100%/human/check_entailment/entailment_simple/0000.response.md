### Reasoning:

To determine the winner of the game, we need to analyze the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob. The key insight here is that the game essentially revolves around the parity (evenness or oddness) of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initial Setup**: Alice starts with `a` coins and Bob with `b` coins.
2. **Turns**: Each player can either swap wallets or not, and then remove one coin from their current wallet.
3. **Winning Condition**: The player who cannot make a move loses. This means that the game ends when both wallets are empty.

### Key Insight:

- If `|a - b|` (the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets) is **even**, then Bob will always win if both play optimally.
- If `|a - b|` is **odd**, then Alice will always win if both play optimally.

#### Why?

- When the difference is even, after each complete round (one move by Alice and one by Bob), the difference remains even. Eventually, both wallets will be emptied simultaneously, and since Bob makes the last move, he wins.
- When the difference is odd, after each complete round, the difference remains odd. Eventually, one wallet will be emptied before the other, and since Alice makes the first move, she will be the one to make the last move, thus winning.

### Verification Against Examples:

- For `a = 1, b = 1`: `|1 - 1| = 0` (even), Bob wins.
- For `a = 1, b = 4`: `|1 - 4| = 3` (odd), Alice wins.
- For `a = 5, b = 3`: `|5 - 3| = 2` (even), Bob wins.
- For `a = 4, b = 5`: `|4 - 5| = 1` (odd), Alice wins.
- For `a = 11, b = 9`: `|11 - 9| = 2` (even), Bob wins.
- For `a = 83, b = 91`: `|83 - 91| = 8` (even), Bob wins.
- For `a = 1032, b = 9307`: `|1032 - 9307| = 8275` (odd), Alice wins.
- For `a = 839204, b = 7281`: `|839204 - 7281| = 831923` (odd), Alice wins.
- For `a = 1000000000, b = 1000000000`: `|1000000000 - 1000000000| = 0` (even), Bob wins.
- For `a = 53110, b = 2024`: `|53110 - 2024| = 51086` (even), Bob wins.
