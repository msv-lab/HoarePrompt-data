### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a grid.
- Each bridge spans from the first column to the last column.
- Supports must be installed at the first and last columns, and the cost of installing a support at `(i, j)` is `a[i][j] + 1`.
- The distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
- We need to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows.

#### Analysis of the Code:
##### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: Calculate the minimum cost to build a bridge on a single row.
- **Implementation**:
  - The first `d-1` columns are incremented by 1.
  - For each subsequent column, it computes the cost by considering the minimum cost of placing a support within the previous `d` columns and adds the current cell's cost plus one.
  - Finally, it returns the cost of the last column.

**Issue**:
- The function does not ensure that the supports are placed such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`. It only considers the minimum cost within the previous `d` columns, which does not guarantee the correct placement of supports according to the problem constraints.

##### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: Handle multiple test cases.
- **Implementation**:
  - Reads the number of rows `n`, columns `m`, number of bridges `k`, and the maximum distance `d`.
  - Reads the grid of depths.
  - Calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
  - Iterates over all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows, sums their costs, and keeps track of the minimum total cost.
  - Prints the minimum total cost.

**Issue**:
- Since `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for placing supports with the distance constraint, `func_2` will also produce incorrect results.

### Dynamic Programming Approach Needed:
To correctly solve the problem, a dynamic programming approach is indeed necessary. For each cell `(i, j)`, we should consider the minimum cost of placing a support at `(i, j)` while respecting the distance constraint `d`. This involves maintaining a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cost to place a support at column `j` in row `i` while satisfying the distance constraint.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as per the given constraints and requirements. The original assessment is accurate.

**Final**: **False**
