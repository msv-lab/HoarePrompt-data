Functionality: **The function modifies a list of non-negative integers (`row`) by incrementing the first `d - 1` elements by 1, and then updating each subsequent element based on the minimum value of the previous `d` elements plus the current element value plus 1. Finally, it returns the last element of the modified list.**
