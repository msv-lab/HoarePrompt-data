You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bernard loves visiting Rudolf, but he is always running late. The problem is
that Bernard has to cross the river on a ferry. Rudolf decided to help his
friend solve this problem.

The river is a grid of n rows and m columns. The intersection of the i -th row
and the j -th column contains the number a_{i,j} — the depth in the
corresponding cell. All cells in the first and last columns correspond to the
river banks, so the depth for them is 0 .

The river may look like this.

Rudolf can choose the row (i,1), (i,2), \ldots, (i,m) and build a bridge over
it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost
of installing a support in the cell (i,j) is a_{i,j}+1 . Supports must be
installed so that the following conditions are met:

  1. A support must be installed in cell (i,1) ; 
  2. A support must be installed in cell (i,m) ; 
  3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d . The distance between supports (i, j_1) and (i, j_2) is |j_1 - j_2| - 1 . 

Building just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build k
bridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some i (1 \le i
\le n - k + 1 ) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows i, i + 1,
\ldots, i + k - 1 . Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing
supports.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , m , k , and d (1
\le k \le n \le 100 , 3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le d \le m ) — the number
of rows and columns of the field, the number of bridges, and the maximum
distance between supports.

Then follow n lines, i -th line contains m positive integers a_{i, j} (0 \le
a_{i, j} \le 10^6 , a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0 ) — the depths of the river cells.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot m for all sets of input data does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum total cost of
supports installation.

Note

In the first test case, it is most profitable to build a bridge on the second
row.

It is not a top view, but side view: gray cells — bridge itself, white cells
are empty, black cells — supports, blue cells — water, brown cells — river
bottom.

In the second test case, it is most profitable to build bridges on the second
and third rows. The supports will be placed in cells (2, 3) , (3, 2) , and on
the river banks.

In the third test case the supports can be placed along the river banks.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a grid.
- Each bridge spans from the first column to the last column.
- Supports must be installed at the first and last columns, and the cost of installing a support at `(i, j)` is `a[i][j] + 1`.
- The distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
- We need to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows.

### Analysis of the Code:
#### Function `func_1`:
This function calculates the minimum cost to build a bridge on a single row.
- It initializes the cost for the first `d-1` columns directly.
- For each subsequent column, it computes the cost by considering the minimum cost of placing a support within the previous `d` columns and adds the current cell's cost plus one.
- Finally, it returns the cost of the last column, which represents the total cost of building a bridge on that row.

#### Function `func_2`:
This function handles multiple test cases.
- It reads the number of rows `n`, columns `m`, number of bridges `k`, and the maximum distance `d`.
- It reads the grid of depths.
- It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
- It then iterates over all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows, sums their costs, and keeps track of the minimum total cost.
- Finally, it prints the minimum total cost.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for placing supports with the constraint that the distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than `d`. It simply considers the minimum cost within the previous `d` columns without ensuring that supports are placed such that the distance constraint is satisfied.
   
2. **Dynamic Programming Approach Needed:**
   - To correctly solve the problem, a dynamic programming approach is needed. Specifically, for each cell `(i, j)`, we should consider the minimum cost of placing a support at `(i, j)` while respecting the distance constraint `d`.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as per the given constraints and requirements.

**Correctness:** **False**
