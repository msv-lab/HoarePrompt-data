To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze whether it correctly implements the solution to the problem described.

### Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the minimum cost to build a bridge on a single row.
   - It iterates through the row and calculates the cost of placing supports such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
   - The logic seems flawed. The function should consider the cost of placing supports in a way that minimizes the total cost while adhering to the constraints. The current implementation does not properly account for the placement of supports beyond the initial `d-1` positions and does not ensure that the minimum cost path is found.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the input, computes the cost for each row using `func_1`, and then finds the minimum total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges.
   - The calculation of `total_costs` is correct in terms of summing up the costs of `k` consecutive rows. However, since `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum cost for a single row, the overall result will also be incorrect.

### Example Walkthrough:

Let's take the first example from the problem statement:

```
3 11 1 4
0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0
0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0
0 1 2 3 5 5 5 5 5 2 0
```

- For `func_1` to work correctly, it needs to find the optimal placement of supports in each row with the minimum cost while ensuring that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
- The current implementation of `func_1` does not guarantee this optimal placement.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for placing supports in a row according to the problem constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
