To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head is defined as:

```python
for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
```

From this, we can see that the only variable that can be adjusted is `i`.

### Analysis:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Adjust `i`:** Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it should be incremented by 1 to start the next iteration. Therefore, `i` becomes 2.
2. **Check Loop Condition:** The loop condition is `i < len(costs) - (k - 1)`. For the loop to execute again, `i` (which is now 2) must be less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

### Conclusion:
The only variable that needs adjustment is `i`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, `costs`, and `total_costs`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`n` must be at least `k`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers; `rows` is a 2D list with at least `k` sublists, each containing `m` integers; `costs` is a list containing the results of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows` and has at least `k` elements; `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs` and the sum of `costs[1]` to `costs[k]`; `i` is 2**
