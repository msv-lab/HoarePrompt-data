The code appends the sum of the first `k` elements of the `costs` list to the `total_costs` list. Since `i` is 0 initially, it sums the elements from index 0 to `k-1` of the `costs` list.

Given that `costs` contains the results of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`, the sum being appended to `total_costs` is the sum of the first `k` such results.

Output State: **`n` must be at least `k`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers; `rows` is a 2D list with at least `k` sublists, each containing `m` integers; `costs` is a list containing the results of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows` and has at least `k` elements; `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`; `i` is 0.**
