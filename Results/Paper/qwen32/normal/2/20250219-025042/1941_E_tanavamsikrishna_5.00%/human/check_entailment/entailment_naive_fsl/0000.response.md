Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is supposed to calculate the cost of building a bridge on a single row considering the constraints. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the placement of supports such that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

   Specifically, the current implementation incorrectly adds 1 to the first `d-1` elements and then calculates the rest based on the minimum value in a sliding window of size `d+1`. This approach does not ensure that the supports are placed optimally according to the problem constraints.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads the input, applies `func_1` to each row to get the cost of building a bridge on that row, and then tries to find the minimum total cost of building `k` consecutive bridges. However, since `func_1` is incorrect, the results from `func_2` will also be incorrect.

### Counterexample

Let's consider a simple counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3 5 1 2
0 1 2 1 0
0 2 1 2 0
0 1 2 1 0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Explanation:**
- For the first row `[0, 1, 2, 1, 0]`, the optimal placement of supports would be at positions 1, 3, and 5, resulting in a cost of `0 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 4`.
- Similarly, for the other rows, the optimal placement would also result in a cost of 4.

However, the provided code would likely not produce the correct result due to the flawed logic in `func_1`.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified in the code, it is clear that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
