The code snippet increments the value of `ans` by 1. Given that the initial value of `ans` is `k + 2`, after the increment, the new value of `ans` will be `k + 3`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\); `s` is a string of length `n - 2 * k - 2` with the first occurrence of the substring `'pie'` removed; `ans` is `k + 3`.**
