To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head. The loop continues as long as the string `s` contains the substring `'pie'`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\)
- `s` is a string of length `n - 2 * k - 2` that contains the substring `'p'` instead of `'pie'`
- `ans` is `k + 2`

The loop condition is `s.find('pie') != -1`, meaning the loop will continue if `'pie'` is found in `s`.

Since the current state specifies that `s` contains `'p'` instead of `'pie'`, we need to adjust `s` so that it contains `'pie'` for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, we need to change `s` such that it includes the substring `'pie'`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\); `s` is a string of length `n - 2 * k - 2` that contains the substring `'pie'`; `ans` is `k + 2`**
