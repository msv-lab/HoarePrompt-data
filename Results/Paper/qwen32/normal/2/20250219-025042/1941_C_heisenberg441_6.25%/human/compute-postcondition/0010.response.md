To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `s.find('map') != -1`. This condition checks whether the substring `'map'` exists in the string `s`.

Given the current state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\)
- `s` is a string of length `n-2` with the first occurrence of the substring `'map'` removed
- `ans` is 2

For the loop to execute one more time, the string `s` must contain the substring `'map'` at least once. Since the current state specifies that the first occurrence of `'map'` has already been removed from `s`, we need to add `'map'` back into `s` to satisfy the loop condition.

Here's how we can adjust the state:

- The variables `t`, `n`, and `ans` do not affect the loop condition and thus do not need to be adjusted.
- The string `s` must be modified to include the substring `'map'`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\); `s` is a string of length `n-2` that contains the substring `'map'`; `ans` is 2**
