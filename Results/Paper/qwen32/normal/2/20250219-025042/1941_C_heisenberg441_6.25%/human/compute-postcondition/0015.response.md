The code modifies the string `s` by removing the substring `'pie'` starting from its first occurrence. The values of `t`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged. 

The new length of `s` will be reduced by 2 because the substring `'pie'` (which has a length of 3) is replaced by an empty string, effectively removing it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\); `s` is a string of length `n - 2 * k - 2` that no longer contains the substring `'map'` and does not contain the substring `'pie'` after the removal; `ans` is `k`.**
