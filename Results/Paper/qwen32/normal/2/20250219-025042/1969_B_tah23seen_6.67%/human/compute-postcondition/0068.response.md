Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `sChar`, which is a list of strings where each string consists only of '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string is between 2 and 2 * 10^5. The total sum of the lengths of all strings in `sChar` does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The function returns the total number of swaps needed to make all strings in `sChar` alternating (i.e., no two adjacent characters are the same).**
