The code increments the value of the variable `right` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `right` was set to `len(s) - 1`. After the increment, `right` becomes `len(s) - 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `len(s)`.

Therefore, the updated value of `right` is `len(s)`.

Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\); `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar` and `s[0]` is '0'; `s[1]` is '0'; `s[2]` is '1'; `s[3]` is '1'; `s[len(s) - 1]` is '1'; `left` is 2; `right` is `len(s)`**.
