To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition:

```python
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions are true:
1. `left < len(s)`
2. `s[left] != '1'`

From the provided state:
- `sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar` and `s[0]` is '0'; `s[1]` is '0'; `s[2]` is '0'; `s[3]` is '1'; `s[len(s) - 1]` is '1'.
- `left` is 3.
- `right` is `len(s)`.

Currently, `left` is 3, and `s[3]` is '1'. Therefore, the condition `s[left] != '1'` is false, and the loop will not execute again with the current state.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `s[left]` is '0' and `left` is less than `len(s)`. Since `left` is already 3, we can decrement `left` to 2 (or any value less than 3) to ensure `s[left]` is '0'.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:
- Set `left` to 2 (since `s[2]` is '0').

This adjustment ensures that `left < len(s)` and `s[left] != '1'` are both true, allowing the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\); `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar` and `s[0]` is '0'; `s[1]` is '0'; `s[2]` is '0'; `s[3]` is '1'; `s[len(s) - 1]` is '1'; `left` is 2; `right` is `len(s)`**
