The given code snippet attempts to append the variable `i` to the list `s`. However, the initial state specifies that `s` is an empty list, and there is no mention of `i` being defined. Since `i` is not defined, this code would raise a `NameError` in Python. 

Given the task's requirement to simulate the execution without considering runtime errors, we will assume that `i` is intended to be a predefined variable. Since `i` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can describe the state after the operation assuming `i` is some value.

Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5, `sChar` must contain at least one such string, `s` is a list containing the element `i`**.

In natural language: The list `s` now contains one element, which is the value of `i`. All other conditions about `sChar` remain unchanged.
