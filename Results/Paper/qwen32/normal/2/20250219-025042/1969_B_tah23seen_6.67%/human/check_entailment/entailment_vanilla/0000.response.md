Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to sort a binary string `s` in non-descending order (i.e., all `0`s followed by all `1`s) using the minimum total cost. The cost of an operation is defined as the length of the substring being cyclically shifted.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases, each containing a binary string. For each string, it calls `func_1(sChar)` to compute the minimum cost to sort the string.

#### Function `func_1(sChar)`
1. **Initialization**:
   - Converts the input string `sChar` into a list `s`.
   - Initializes `left` pointer to 0, `right` pointer to 1, and `cost` to 0.
   
2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues while `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `right` is less than the length of `s`, and `left` is less than the length of `s`.
   - If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', it swaps these two elements and adds the cost `right - left + 1` to the total cost.
   - It then moves the `right` pointer to the next '0' in the string.
   - It also moves the `left` pointer to the next '1' in the string.

### Issues with the Program
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost calculation `right - left + 1` is not always correct. This formula assumes that swapping `s[right]` and `s[left]` directly results in the minimum cost, but this is not necessarily true for cyclic shifts.
   - The program does not consider the actual cost of cyclically shifting a substring to move a '0' past a '1'.

2. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The program only swaps adjacent '0's and '1's, which may not lead to the minimum cost solution.
   - It does not handle cases where multiple swaps are needed to move a '0' past several '1's efficiently.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program might not handle edge cases correctly, such as strings with all '0's or all '1's, or strings that require more complex cyclic shifts.

### Conclusion
Given the issues with the cost calculation and logic, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
