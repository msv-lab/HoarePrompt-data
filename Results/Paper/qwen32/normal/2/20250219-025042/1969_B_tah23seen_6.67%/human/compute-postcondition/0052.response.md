To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, let's analyze the loop condition:

```
while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if both conditions are true:
1. `right < len(s)`
2. `s[right] != '0'`

Given the initial state:
- `sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar` and `s[0]` is '0'; `s[1]` is '0'; `s[2]` is '0'; `s[3]` is '1'; `s[len(s) - 1]` is '1'.
- `left` is 3.
- `right` is `len(s) - 1`.

From the description, `s[len(s) - 1]` is '1'. This means `s[right]` is '1', satisfying the second condition (`s[right] != '0'`).

However, the first condition (`right < len(s)`) is inherently satisfied because `right` is initialized to `len(s) - 1`, which is always less than `len(s)`.

Since both conditions are already satisfied with the given initial state, no adjustments are needed.

State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\); `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar` and `s[0]` is '0'; `s[1]` is '0'; `s[2]` is '0'; `s[3]` is '1'; `s[len(s) - 1]` is '1'; `left` is 3; `right` is `len(s) - 1`.**
