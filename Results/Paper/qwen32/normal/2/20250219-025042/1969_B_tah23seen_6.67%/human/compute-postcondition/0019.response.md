The code increments the value of `right` by 1. Given the initial state, `right` was 2, so after the increment, `right` becomes 3.

No other variables are affected by this operation, and their values remain the same. Specifically, `sChar`, `s`, `left`, `s[1]`, `s[2]`, and `cost` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5; `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar`; `left` is 0; `right` is 3; `s[1]` is '1'; `s[2]` is '1'; if `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', then `cost` is 2; otherwise, `cost` remains 0.**
