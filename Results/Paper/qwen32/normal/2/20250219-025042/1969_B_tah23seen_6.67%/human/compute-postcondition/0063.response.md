To determine how to modify the program state so that the next iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head:

```python
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will continue to execute as long as `left` is less than the length of `s` and the character at index `left` in `s` is not '1'.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar` and `s[0]` is '0'; `s[1]` is '0'; `s[2]` is '0'; `s[3]` is '1'; `s[len(s) - 1]` is '1'.
- `left` is 3.
- `right` is `len(s)`.

Let's analyze the conditions:
1. `left < len(s)`: This condition is already satisfied since `left` is 3 and `s[3]` exists (it is '1').
2. `s[left] != '1'`: This condition is not satisfied because `s[3]` is '1', which means the current loop iteration would terminate.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `s[left]` is not '1'. Since `left` is currently 3 and `s[3]` is '1', we should decrement `left` so that it points to an index where `s[left]` is '0'.

Given the values of `s`:
- `s[0]` is '0'
- `s[1]` is '0'
- `s[2]` is '0'

We can set `left` to 2, which will satisfy both conditions:
- `left < len(s)` (2 < len(s))
- `s[left] != '1'` (s[2] is '0')

Therefore, the modified state should be:
State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\); `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar` and `s[0]` is '0'; `s[1]` is '0'; `s[2]` is '0'; `s[3]` is '1'; `s[len(s) - 1]` is '1'; `left` is 2; `right` is `len(s)`**
