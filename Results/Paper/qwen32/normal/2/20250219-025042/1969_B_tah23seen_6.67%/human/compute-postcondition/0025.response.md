To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the `while` loop condition:

```python
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions are true:
1. `left < len(s)`
2. `s[left] != '1'`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5.
- `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar` and `s[0]` is '0'.
- `left` is 1.
- `right` is len(s).
- `s[1]` is '1'.
- `s[2]` is '1'.
- `s[3]` is '1'.
- If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', then `cost` is 2; otherwise, `cost` remains 0.

Let's evaluate the conditions:
1. `left < len(s)`: Since `left` is 1 and `s` contains at least `s[0]` and `s[1]`, this condition is true.
2. `s[left] != '1'`: Given that `s[1]` is '1', this condition is false.

Since the second condition (`s[left] != '1'`) is false, the loop will not execute again with the current state. To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust `s[left]` to be something other than '1'.

Therefore, we need to change `s[left]` (which is `s[1]`) to '0'. This will make the second condition true.

Adjusted State:
- `sChar` remains the same.
- `s` remains the same except `s[1]` is changed to '0'.
- `left` remains 1.
- `right` remains len(s).
- `s[1]` is now '0'.
- `s[2]` remains '1'.
- `s[3]` remains '1'.
- The value of `cost` remains unchanged based on the new values of `s[left]` and `s[right]`.

State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5; `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar` and `s[0]` is '0'; `s[1]` is '0'; `s[2]` is '1'; `s[3]` is '1'; `left` is 1; `right` is len(s)**
