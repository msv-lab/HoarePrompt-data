The code snippet takes the first two elements of the list `l1`, converts them to integers, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range and `l1` is a list of substrings. After executing the code, `n` and `k` will hold the integer values of the first two elements of `l1`. The values of `t` and the remaining elements of `l1` (if any) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained from the input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.**
