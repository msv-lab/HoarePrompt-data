Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **`l1`**: A list of substrings obtained from splitting a new input line by whitespace.
3. **`n`**: The integer value of the first element of `l1`.
4. **`k`**: The integer value of the second element of `l1`.
5. **`arr`**: An empty list if `n` is not equal to 1.
6. **`k0`**: Equal to `k`.
7. **`ans`**: A list of length `n` where the first two elements are `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`, and the remaining elements are zeros.
8. **`i`**: The number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became greater than or equal to `k`.
9. **`temp`**: The largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.

### Key Points to Consider:

- The `print(k)` statement will simply print the value of `k`.
- `k` is explicitly mentioned as the integer value of the second element of the list `l1`.

### Conclusion:

Given the initial state, the value of `k` is directly derived from the input line and does not depend on any calculations or conditions within the provided snippet other than being the second element of `l1`.

Thus, the output of the `print(k)` statement will be the value of `k` as it is.

### Final Output:

Output: **k (where k is the integer value of the second element of the list l1)**
