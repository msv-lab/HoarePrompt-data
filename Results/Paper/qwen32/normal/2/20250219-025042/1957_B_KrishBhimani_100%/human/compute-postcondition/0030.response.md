The code snippet appends a specific value to the list `ans`. The value being appended is `(1 << i) - 1`, which is equivalent to \(2^i - 1\). This operation does not affect any other variables except `ans`.

Given the initial state, `i` is defined as the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became not less than `k`. Since `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is still less than `k`, `i` effectively represents the exponent of the highest power of 2 that is less than `k`.

Thus, the value `(1 << i) - 1` is calculated and added to the list `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained from the input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `n` is not equal to 1; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing the single element `(1 << i) - 1`; `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became not less than `k`; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is still less than `k`.**
