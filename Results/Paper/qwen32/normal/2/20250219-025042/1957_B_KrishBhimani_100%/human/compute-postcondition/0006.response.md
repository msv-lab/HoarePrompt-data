The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `arr`. None of the other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`) are modified by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained from the input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `n` is not equal to 1; `arr` is an empty list.**
