The code reads a line of input, splits it into a list of substrings using whitespace as the delimiter, and assigns this list to the variable `l1`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, but `t` is not used in the given code snippet, so its value remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained from the input line split by whitespace.**
