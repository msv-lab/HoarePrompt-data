To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `l1` is a new list of substrings obtained from the new input line split by whitespace.
   - `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`.
   - `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`.
   - If `n` equals 1, no additional changes are made.
   - Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list.
   - `k0` is equal to `k`.
   - `ans` is a list of length `n` where the first two elements are \((1 << i) - 1\) and \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\), and the remaining elements are zeros.
   - `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became greater than or equal to `k`.
   - `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.

2. **Relevant Code**:
   ```python
   print(k)
   ```

From the initial state, we know that `k` is explicitly defined as the integer value of the second element of the list `l1`. No operations or modifications are performed on `k` before the `print(k)` statement is executed.

Therefore, the value of `k` remains unchanged and is directly printed.

**Output**: **k (where k is the integer value of the second element of the list l1)**
