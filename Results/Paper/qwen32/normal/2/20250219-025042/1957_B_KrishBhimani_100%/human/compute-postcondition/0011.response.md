In this case, the `while` loop is defined as `while True:`. This means that the loop will always execute at least once regardless of the values of any variables. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to ensure that the loop executes its first iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained from the input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `n` is not equal to 1; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `i` is 0; `ans` is an empty list; `temp` is 1**
