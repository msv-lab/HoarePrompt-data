The given code snippet is `temp *= 2`, which means the value of `temp` is doubled.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `l1` is a new list of substrings obtained from the new input line split by whitespace
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`
- If `n` equals 1, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list
- `k0` is equal to `k`
- `ans` is an empty list
- `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `temp * 2` is less than `k`
- `temp` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `temp * 2` is less than `k`

Impact of the code:
- `temp` is doubled (`temp *= 2`)

Given the conditions for `temp`:
- If `temp * 2` was less than `k`, then `temp` was either 1 or 2 (depending on whether `temp * 2` was still less than `k` after the doubling).
- If `temp * 2` was not less than `k`, then `temp` was 1 or 2, but doubling it would make it not less than `k`.

After doubling:
- If `temp` was 1, it becomes 2.
- If `temp` was 2, it becomes 4.

Since `i` depends on whether `temp * 2` is less than `k`, and `temp` has now been doubled, `i` may also change:
- If `temp` was 1 and `k > 2`, `i` was 1 and remains 1 if `k > 4`.
- If `temp` was 1 and `k <= 2`, `i` was 0 and remains 0.
- If `temp` was 2 and `k > 4`, `i` was 1 and remains 1.
- If `temp` was 2 and `k <= 4`, `i` was 1 and becomes 0.

However, since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we can only describe the possible states of `i` based on the new value of `temp`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings obtained from the new input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`; If `n` equals 1, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `temp * 2` is less than `k`; `temp` is either 2 or 4.**
