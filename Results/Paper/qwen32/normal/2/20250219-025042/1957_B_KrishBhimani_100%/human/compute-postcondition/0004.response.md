Given the initial state, let's break down the values of the variables:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
- `l1` is a list of substrings obtained from the input line split by whitespace.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1` and `n` equals 1. This means the first element of `l1` must be the string "1".
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(k)
```

To determine the output, we need to know the value of `k`. Since `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, and `l1` is a list of substrings split from an input line, we can infer that the input line must have been something like "1 k_value" where `k_value` is the actual number that `k` represents.

However, the exact value of `k` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of `k`.

Output: **k (where k is the integer value of the second element of the input line split by whitespace)**
