Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a string `s` of lowercase English letters. For each string, it generates a random permutation `s2`. If `s2` is different from `s`, it prints 'Yes' followed by `s2`; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.**
