Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 999, `s` is the new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, and `s2` is a new permutation of the original string `s`. Regardless of whether `s` is equal to `s2` or not, the values of `t`, `s`, and `s2` remain consistent with these conditions.**
