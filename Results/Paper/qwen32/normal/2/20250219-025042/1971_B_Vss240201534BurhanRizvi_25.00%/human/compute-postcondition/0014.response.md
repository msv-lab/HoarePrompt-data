The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `s`, or `s2` described in the initial state. Therefore, the values of these variables do not influence the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `s`, and `s2`:
   - `t` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive.
   - `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
   - `s2` is a permutation of the string `s`.

2. The `print` statement is:
   ```python
   print('No')
   ```

3. Since the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'No'`, it does not involve any computation or evaluation of the variables `t`, `s`, or `s2`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'No'`.

Output: **No**
