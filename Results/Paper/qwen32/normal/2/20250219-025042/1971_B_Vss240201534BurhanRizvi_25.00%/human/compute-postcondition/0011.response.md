The code snippet uses the `random.sample` function to shuffle the characters of the string `s`. The result is stored in the variable `s2`. Since `random.sample` returns a list of elements from the input sequence in random order, `s2` will be a permutation of the original string `s`.

Given that `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `s2` will also be a string of the same length, containing the same characters as `s` but possibly in a different order.

The integer `t` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 999, and `s` is the new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters; `s2` is a permutation of the string `s`.**
