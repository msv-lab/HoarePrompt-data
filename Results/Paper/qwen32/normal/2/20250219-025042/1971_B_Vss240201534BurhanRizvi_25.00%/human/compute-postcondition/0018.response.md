The code snippet shuffles the characters of the string `s` and assigns the shuffled string to `s2`. The value of `t` remains unchanged.

Given that `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, and `s2` is initially a permutation of `s`, after executing the code, `s2` will be a new permutation of `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 999, `s` is the new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `s2` is a new permutation of the original string `s`.**
