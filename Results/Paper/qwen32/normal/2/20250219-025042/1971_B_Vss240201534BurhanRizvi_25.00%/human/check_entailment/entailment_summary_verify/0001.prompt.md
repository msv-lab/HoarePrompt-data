You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a string `s` of lowercase English letters. For each string, it generates a random permutation `s2`. If `s2` is different from `s`, it prints 'Yes' followed by `s2`; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: 
   - An integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters.

2. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output "YES" followed by a rearrangement of the string `s` that is not equal to `s`, if such a rearrangement exists.
   - If no such rearrangement exists, output "NO".

3. **Constraints**:
   - The length of the string `s` is at most 10.
   - There could be up to 1000 test cases.

### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the string `s`.
- It then generates a random permutation of the string `s` using `random.sample(s, len(s))`.
- If the generated permutation `s2` is different from the original string `s`, it prints "YES" followed by `s2`.
- If the generated permutation `s2` is the same as `s`, it prints "NO".

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Randomness and Consistency**:
   - The use of `random.sample` means that there is a chance (albeit small) that the generated permutation `s2` could be the same as `s`. This is because `random.sample` does not guarantee a unique permutation; it simply shuffles the elements.
   - For strings with repeated characters (like "aaaaa"), the probability of generating the same string is higher, leading to incorrect outputs ("NO") when a valid rearrangement exists.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where rearranging the string is impossible (e.g., a string with all identical characters like "aaaaa"). While the program correctly identifies these cases, it does so by chance rather than by design.

### Conclusion:
Given the above points, the program is not guaranteed to produce correct results for all test cases due to the reliance on randomness. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**

To make the program correct, we need to ensure that we can always find a valid rearrangement if one exists, without relying on randomness. One approach would be to systematically generate permutations until a valid one is found, or to use a more deterministic method to check for the possibility of rearrangement.
