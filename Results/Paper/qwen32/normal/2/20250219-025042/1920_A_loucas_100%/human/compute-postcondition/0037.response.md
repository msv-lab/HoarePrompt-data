Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `loop` is greater than 0, `less` is a list containing all `a` where `x` was 2, `big` is a list containing all `a` where `x` was 1, `no` is a list containing all `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, and if `num` is less than 1, the condition `num < 1` holds true. `innerLoop` is greater than 0.**
