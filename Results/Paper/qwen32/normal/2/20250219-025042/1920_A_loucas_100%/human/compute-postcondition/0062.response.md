Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `loop` is greater than 0, `less` is a list containing the second integer from the input, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `x` is 2 (the first integer from the input), `a` is the second integer from the input.**

Explanation: The variable `less` now contains the second integer from the input, while all other variables retain their initial values.
