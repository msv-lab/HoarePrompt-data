The code appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. Therefore, the list `no` will now contain the single element `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `loop` is greater than 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing the integer `a`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `x` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, `x` is not equal to 1, and `x` is not equal to 2.**
