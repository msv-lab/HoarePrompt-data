The value of `innerLoop` is updated to the integer value obtained from the input. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `loop` is greater than 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is an input integer, `iterable` is incremented by 1.**
