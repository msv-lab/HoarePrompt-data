Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `loop` is greater than 0, `less` is a list containing all `a` where `x` was 2, `big` is a list containing all `a` where `x` was 1, `no` is a list containing at least one element, `num` is `min(less) - max(big)`, and if `num` is less than 1, the condition `num < 1` holds true, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `i` is an integer such that `i <= min(less)` and `i >= max(big)`**

Explanation: The value of `num` is decremented by 1. Initially, `num` was defined as `min(less) - max(big) + 1`. After decrementing, `num` becomes `min(less) - max(big)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
