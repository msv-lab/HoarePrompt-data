The code snippet appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. Given the initial state, `big` could either be an empty list or a list containing the single element `a` if `x` was 1. After appending `a` to `big`, `big` will definitely contain at least one `a`.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `loop` remains greater than 0.
- `less` remains a list containing the integer `a` if `x` is 2, otherwise it remains unchanged.
- `big` now contains the integer `a` at least once (either it was already there or it has been added).
- `no` remains a list containing `[a]` if `x` is not 1 and not 2, otherwise it remains unchanged.
- `num` remains 0.
- `innerLoop` remains greater than 0.
- `x` and `a` remain the two integers read from the input.
- `iterable2` remains 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `loop` is greater than 0, `less` is a list containing the integer `a` if `x` is 2, `big` is a list containing at least one `a`, `no` is a list containing `[a]` if `x` is not 1 and not 2, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` and `a` are the two integers read from the input, `iterable2` is 1.**
