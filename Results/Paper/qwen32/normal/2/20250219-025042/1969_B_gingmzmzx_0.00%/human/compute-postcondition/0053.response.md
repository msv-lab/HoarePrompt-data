The code snippet sets `ans` to 0. This affects the variable `ans` directly, while the other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a new list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, `n` is `n + 1`, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is [0, 0], `ans` is 0.**
