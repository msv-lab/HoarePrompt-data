Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and `s` must have at least one element, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is [1, 0] or [0, 1]. If `c` is 0, `ans` is 0 if `cnt` is [1, 0] and `ans` is 1 if `cnt` is [0, 1]. Otherwise, `ans` is `ans + (zeroes - cnt[0])` and `c` is not equal to 0.**
