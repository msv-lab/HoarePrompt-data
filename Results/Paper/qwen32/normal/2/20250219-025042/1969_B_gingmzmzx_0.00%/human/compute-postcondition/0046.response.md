Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and `s` must have at least one element, `n` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is updated to `[cnt[0] + 1, cnt[1]]` if `c` is 0 or `[cnt[0], cnt[1] + 1]` if `c` is 1, `c` is the next element in the list `s` following the previously processed element. If `c` is 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1] > 0`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans + (zeroes - cnt[0])`.**
