Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and `s` must have at least one element, `n` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is either `[1, 1]`, `[2, 0]`, or `[0, 2]`, `c` is the next element in the list `s`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1] > 0` else remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans` is increased by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
