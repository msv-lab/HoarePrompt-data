You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        cnt = [0, 0]
        ans = 0
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, s is a binary string of length between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, consisting only of '0' and '1'. The sum of the lengths of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        
        cnt = [0, 0]
        
        ans = 0
        
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: t remains the same, n becomes 0, cnt contains the total counts of 0s and 1s, ans contains the accumulated result.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of a binary string `s`. For each binary string, it calculates and prints a value `ans` which represents the number of valid pairs `(i, j)` such that `i < j` and the substring `s[i:j+1]` contains at least one '0' and one '1'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

We need to sort a binary string `s` in non-descending order (i.e., all 0s should come before all 1s) using the minimum total cost. The cost of performing a cyclic shift on a substring `s[l...r]` is `r - l + 1`.

### Key Observations

1. **Objective**: To minimize the cost of sorting the string, we need to move all 0s to the front and all 1s to the back.
2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost is determined by how many shifts are required to achieve the sorted order. The more 1s we encounter before a 0, the higher the cost because each 1 encountered before a 0 needs to be shifted past that 0.

### Strategy

- Traverse the string and keep track of the count of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
- For each 0 encountered after at least one 1 has been seen, increment the cost by 1 because this 0 needs to be shifted past all previously seen 1s.
- For each 1 encountered, add the number of 0s seen so far to the cost because each of these 0s needs to be shifted past this 1.

### Provided Program Analysis

Here's the provided program with comments explaining each part:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases
    for _ in range(n):  # Iterate through each test case
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))  # Read the binary string and convert it to a list of integers
        zeroes = s.count(0)  # Count the total number of 0s in the string
        cnt = [0, 0]  # Initialize counters for 0s and 1s encountered so far
        ans = 0  # Initialize the total cost to 0
        for c in s:  # Traverse the string
            cnt[c] += 1  # Increment the count of the current character (0 or 1)
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0  # If a 0 is encountered after at least one 1, increment the cost by 1
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]  # If a 1 is encountered, add the number of 0s seen so far to the cost
        print(ans)  # Print the total cost for the current test case
```

### Verification Against Test Cases

Let's verify the program against the provided example test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**: `s = "10"`
   - Initial state: `cnt = [0, 0]`, `ans = 0`
   - After processing '1': `cnt = [0, 1]`, `ans = 0`
   - After processing '0': `cnt = [1, 1]`, `ans = 1` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
   - Output: `1` (incorrect, expected `2`)

2. **Test Case 2**: `s = "0000"`
   - Initial state: `cnt = [0, 0]`, `ans = 0`
   - After processing each '0': `cnt = [1, 0]`, `ans = 0` (no changes since no 1s have been seen)
   - Output: `0` (correct)

3. **Test Case 3**: `s = "11000"`
   - Initial state: `cnt = [0, 0]`, `ans = 0`
   - After processing '1': `cnt = [0, 1]`, `ans = 0`
   - After processing '1': `cnt = [0, 2]`, `ans = 0`
   - After processing '0': `cnt = [1, 2]`, `ans = 2` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
   - After processing '0': `cnt = [2, 2]`, `ans = 4` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
   - After processing '0': `cnt = [3, 2]`, `ans = 6` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
   - Output: `6` (incorrect, expected `9`)

From the above analysis, it's clear that the provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for sorting the string in non-descending order.

### Conclusion

The provided program is incorrect because it does not accurately compute the minimum cost required to sort the binary string.
