Postcondition: **`nodes` is a defaultdict with at least one key-value pair, `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game such that 1 <= `start` <= n, where n is the total number of nodes in the tree; `n` is the total number of nodes in the tree; `t` is the second integer from the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; if `len(nodes[key]) == 1`, `leaves` is a deque containing `key`; otherwise, `leaves` remains unchanged.**
