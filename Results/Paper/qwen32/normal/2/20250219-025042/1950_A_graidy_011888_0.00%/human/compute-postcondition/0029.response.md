Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; for each of the t test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; `i` is 2; `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9; `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9; `z` is a new random integer between 1 and 9; `res` is 'none'.**

In this output state, the only change is that the variable `res` has been assigned the value `'none'`. All other variables retain their initial values.
