Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; for each of the t test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; `i` is 3; `x`, `y`, and `z` are new random integers between 1 and 9. If `x` < `y`, then `res` is 'peak' if `y` > `z`, 'stair' if `y` < `z`, and 'none' if `y` == `z`. Otherwise, `res` is 'none'.**
