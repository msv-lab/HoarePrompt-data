Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; For each of the t test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; `i` is 1; `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9; `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9.**

Explanation: The variable `y` is assigned a random integer value between 1 and 9. All other variables retain their initial values.
