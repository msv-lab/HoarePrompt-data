Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

# Annotated Program:
from random import randint

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each of the t test cases, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        
        y = randint(1, 9)
        
        z = randint(1, 9)
        
        res = ''
        
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        
        print(res)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; for each of the t test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; `i` is 1001; `x`, `y`, and `z` are random integers between 1 and 9 from the last iteration; `res` is determined based on the last values of `x`, `y`, and `z` as per the given conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function generates and prints 1000 sets of three random integers between 1 and 9. For each set, it determines and prints whether the sequence forms a 'peak', 'stair', or 'none' based on specific conditions.
