Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; for each of the t test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; `i` is 1; `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9; `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9; `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9; `res` is 'peak' if `y` is greater than `z`, 'stair' if `y` is less than `z`, or 'none' if `y` is equal to `z`; additionally, `x` is less than `y`.**
