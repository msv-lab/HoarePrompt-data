The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to a string, and assigns the resulting list to `aa`. This means that `aa` will now hold a list of strings corresponding to the integers that were originally in the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, `nabors` must be greater than or equal to 1, `aa` is a list of strings representing integers read from input.**
