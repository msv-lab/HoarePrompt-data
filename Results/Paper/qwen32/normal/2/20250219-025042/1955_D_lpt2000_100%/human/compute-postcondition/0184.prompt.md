Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. a is a list of n integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. b is a list of m integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `nabors` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(nabors):
    n, m, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    aa = [str(i) for i in input().split()]
    bb = [str(i) for i in input().split()]
    cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
    cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
    D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
    pairs_in_D = sum(D.values())
    E = cnt_aa - D
    C = cnt_bb - D
    fnd = 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
    for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
        if D[out_aa] > 0:
            if E[out_aa] > 0:
                E[out_aa] -= 1
            else:
                D[out_aa] -= 1
                pairs_in_D -= 1
                C[out_aa] += 1
        else:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        if C[in_aa] > 0:
            D[in_aa] += 1
            pairs_in_D += 1
            C[in_aa] -= 1
        else:
            E[in_aa] += 1
        fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
    print(fnd)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `D` is the intersection of the last `m` elements of `aa` and `bb`, `E` is the difference between the last `m` elements of `aa` and `D`, `C` is the difference between `bb` and `D`, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in the final `D`, and `fnd` is the total number of times `pairs_in_D` was at least `k` during the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: D is the intersection of the last m elements of aa and bb, E is the difference between the last m elements of aa and D, C is the difference between bb and D, pairs_in_D is the sum of the values in D, fnd is the count of iterations where pairs_in_D was at least k.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `D` is the adjusted intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is the adjusted difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`, `C` is the adjusted difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D` after all adjustments, `fnd` is the count of times `pairs_in_D` was at least `k` during the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
