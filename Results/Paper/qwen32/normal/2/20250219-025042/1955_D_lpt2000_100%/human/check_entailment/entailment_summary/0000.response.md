### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to solve the problem by using a sliding window approach combined with the `Counter` class from the `collections` module. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Sliding Window Setup**:
   - The initial window of size `m` is taken from the array `a` and counted using `Counter`.
   - The array `b` is also counted using `Counter`.

3. **Intersection Calculation**:
   - The intersection of the counts of the initial window and `b` is calculated (`D`).
   - The number of matching elements in the initial window is determined by summing the values in `D`.

4. **Sliding the Window**:
   - The program slides the window one element at a time from left to right across the array `a`.
   - For each new position of the window:
     - It updates the counts by removing the element that is sliding out of the window and adding the element that is sliding into the window.
     - It adjusts the intersection `D` and the counts `E` (elements in the current window but not in `b`) and `C` (elements in `b` but not in the current window) accordingly.
     - It checks if the number of matching elements (`pairs_in_D`) is at least `k` and increments the count of good subarrays if true.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all windows for a test case, the program outputs the count of good subarrays.

### Correctness:

- **Logic**: The logic of maintaining the counts and updating them as the window slides is correct. The intersection `D` ensures that we only consider elements that are present in both the current window and `b`.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when `k` is equal to `m` (all elements must match), when `k` is 1 (at least one element must match), and when there are no matching elements.
- **Efficiency**: The use of `Counter` and set operations makes the solution efficient enough to handle the upper limits of `n` and `m` as specified in the problem constraints.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
