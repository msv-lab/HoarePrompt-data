The value of `l` is determined by taking the maximum of 1 and the expression `yb - x`. Given that `x` is `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`, the value of `l` will be the greater of 1 or `yb - (abs(xa - xb) // 2)`.

Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers read from the input, `x` is `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`, `l` is `max(1, yb - (abs(xa - xb) // 2))`**.
