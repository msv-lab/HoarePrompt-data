Let's break down the given code and determine what will be printed based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers read from the input.
- `x` is calculated as \(\left| xa - xb \right| // 2\).
- `l` is calculated as \(\max(1, yb - \left| xa - xb \right| // 2)\).
- `r` is calculated as \(\min(w, yb + \left| xa - xb \right| // 2)\).

### Code Analysis:
The `print` statement uses a conditional expression to choose between two lists:
```python
print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1])
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Calculate `x`:**
   - `x = (abs(xa - xb) // 2)`: This computes half the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb`.

2. **Calculate `l`:**
   - `l = max(1, yb - (abs(xa - xb) // 2))`: This ensures `l` is at least 1 and no more than `yb - x`.

3. **Calculate `r`:**
   - `r = min(w, yb + (abs(xa - xb) // 2))`: This ensures `r` is at most `w` and no less than `yb + x`.

4. **Conditional Expression:**
   - The expression `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` checks if both conditions are true:
     - `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1`: This checks if the vertical distance from `ya` to `l` is within `x + 1`.
     - `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`: This checks if the vertical distance from `ya` to `r` is within `x + 1`.

5. **Conditional Selection:**
   - If both conditions are true, the expression evaluates to `True`, and the second list `['Alice']` is selected.
   - If either condition is false, the expression evaluates to `False`, and the first list `['Draw']` is selected.

6. **Unpacking and Printing:**
   - The `*` operator unpacks the selected list and prints its elements.

### Output Determination:
Based on the above analysis, the output depends on the values of `l`, `ya`, `r`, and `x`:
- If both `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` are true, the output will be `Alice`.
- Otherwise, the output will be `Draw`.

Since the exact values of `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are not provided, we cannot determine with certainty whether the conditions will be true or false. However, we can describe the output based on the conditions.

### Final Output:
Output: **Draw or Alice (depending on whether both abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1 are true)**
