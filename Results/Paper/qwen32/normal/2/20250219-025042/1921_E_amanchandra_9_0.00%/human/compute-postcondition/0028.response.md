The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the integer value read from the input (`t`).

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers read from the input. If `xa > xb`, the program does not modify any additional variables. Otherwise, `x` is set to `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`. If `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is true (i.e., `abs(xa - xb)` is odd), then `l` is `max(1, yb - (abs(xa - xb) // 2))` and `r` is `min(w, yb + (abs(xa - xb) // 2))`. Otherwise, `l` is `max(1, ya - (abs(xa - xb) // 2))` and `r` is `min(w, ya + (abs(xa - xb) // 2))`.**
