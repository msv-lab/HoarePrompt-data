Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `h` is an integer, `w` is an integer, `xa` is an integer, `ya` is an integer, `xb` is an integer, `yb` is an integer, `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`, `x` is (abs(`xa` - `xb`) // 2), and the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even**
