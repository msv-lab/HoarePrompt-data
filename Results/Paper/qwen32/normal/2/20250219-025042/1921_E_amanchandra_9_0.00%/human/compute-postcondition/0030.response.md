The given initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `i`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Draw'`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.
- `i` is set to 2.
- `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers read from the input, but they are not referenced in the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables, it will always output the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
