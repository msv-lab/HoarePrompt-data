To determine if the given program correctly solves the problem, we need to analyze its logic against the rules of the game and the expected outcomes.

### Game Analysis:
1. **Initial Conditions**: Alice starts at `(xa, ya)` and Bob starts at `(xb, yb)`. They cannot start on the same cell.
2. **Moves**:
   - Alice can move down, down-left, or down-right.
   - Bob can move up, up-left, or up-right.
3. **Winning Condition**: A player wins if they land on the cell occupied by the other player.
4. **Draw Condition**: If a player cannot make a move, the game ends in a draw.
   - Alice cannot move if `xa == h`.
   - Bob cannot move if `xb == 1`.

### Strategy:
- If Alice is initially above Bob (`xa < xb`), she can potentially win if she can force Bob into a position where he cannot avoid landing on her cell.
- If Alice is initially below Bob (`xa > xb`), Bob can potentially win if he can force Alice into a position where she cannot avoid landing on his cell.
- If Alice and Bob are on the same row (`xa == xb`), it depends on their column positions and whether they can force each other into a corner.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses the following logic:
- If `xa > xb`, it prints "Draw". This is incorrect because Alice can still potentially win if she can force Bob into a position where he lands on her cell.
- If `xa <= xb`, it calculates the distance `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2` and checks the column positions to determine the winner or if it's a draw.

Let's break down the logic for `xa <= xb`:
- `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`: This calculates half the vertical distance between Alice and Bob.
- If `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is true (i.e., the distance is odd):
  - It calculates the range of columns `[l, r]` that Bob can reach within `x + 1` moves.
  - If Alice's column `ya` is within this range, Alice can win.
- If `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is false (i.e., the distance is even):
  - It calculates the range of columns `[l, r]` that Bob can reach within `x` moves.
  - If Bob's column `yb` is within this range, Bob can win.

### Issues:
- The condition `if xa > xb: print('Draw')` is incorrect. Alice can still win if she can force Bob into a position where he lands on her cell.
- The logic for determining the winner when `xa <= xb` seems to be correct, but the initial condition needs adjustment.

### Conclusion:
The program incorrectly handles the case where `xa > xb` by immediately declaring a draw. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
