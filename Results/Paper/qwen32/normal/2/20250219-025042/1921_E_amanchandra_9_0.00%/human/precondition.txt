h and w are integers representing the number of rows and columns of the board respectively, such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^9. x_a, y_a, x_b, and y_b are integers representing the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips respectively, such that 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h and 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w. It is guaranteed that either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b.
