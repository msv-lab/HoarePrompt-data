Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers read from the input, `x` is `abs(xa - xb) // 2`, `l` is `max(1, ya - abs(xa - xb) // 2)`, `r` is `min(w, yb + x)`**

Natural Language: The variable `r` is now assigned the value of the minimum between `w` and `yb + x`. All other variables retain their initial values.
