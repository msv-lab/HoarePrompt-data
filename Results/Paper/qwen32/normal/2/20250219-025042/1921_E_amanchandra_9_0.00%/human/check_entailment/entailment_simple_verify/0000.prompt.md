You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description:

### Program Analysis

The program is designed to determine the winner of a game played on a checkered board between Alice and Bob, given their initial positions and the dimensions of the board. Here’s a breakdown of the logic used in the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the board dimensions `h` and `w`, and the initial positions of Alice `(xa, ya)` and Bob `(xb, yb)`.

2. **Determining the Outcome:**
   - If Alice's initial row `xa` is greater than Bob's initial row `xb`, the program outputs "Draw".
   - Otherwise, it calculates `x` as half the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb`, rounded down.
   - If the difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd:
     - It calculates the range `[l, r]` where Bob could potentially move to in the same number of moves as Alice.
     - It checks if Alice can move into this range within `x + 1` moves.
     - If yes, it outputs "Alice"; otherwise, it outputs "Draw".
   - If the difference between `xa` and `xb` is even:
     - It calculates the range `[l, r]` where Bob could potentially move to in the same number of moves as Alice.
     - It checks if Bob can move into this range within `x` moves.
     - If yes, it outputs "Bob"; otherwise, it outputs "Draw".

### Potential Issues

Let's consider some edge cases and scenarios to see if the program handles them correctly:

1. **Alice and Bob in Different Rows:**
   - If Alice starts in a row above Bob (`xa < xb`), the program correctly checks whether Alice can catch up to Bob within the constraints.
   - If Alice starts in a row below or equal to Bob (`xa >= xb`), the program outputs "Draw" immediately, which might not always be correct.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Alice and Bob in the Same Row:** The program outputs "Draw" immediately, which is correct since neither can move towards the other.
   - **Alice in the Last Row or Bob in the First Row:** The program does not explicitly handle these cases, but the logic seems to account for it indirectly by checking the ranges.

3. **Optimal Moves:**
   - The program assumes that both players play optimally, which aligns with the problem description.

### Testing the Program

Let's test the program with a few cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `6 5 2 2 5 3`
   - Expected Output: `Alice`

    - Input: `10 10 3 1 1 1`
    - Expected Output: `Draw`
    - Explanation: Alice and Bob are in different rows, but neither can catch up to the other within the constraints.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and testing it with various cases, it appears that the program correctly determines the outcome of the game according to the problem description. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the program fails to produce the correct result.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**.
