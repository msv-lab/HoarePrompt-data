The given code snippet reads six integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb`. No further operations are performed on these variables within the provided code snippet.

Therefore, the only change in the state is that the variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` now hold the values read from the input. The initial conditions for `t` and `i` remain unchanged, and no new variables are introduced or modified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers read from the input.**
