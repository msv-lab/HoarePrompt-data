The provided code snippet reads six integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb`. This means the initial values of these variables are overwritten by the new values read from the input.

Given the initial state, the only variables that are affected by this code are `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb`. All other variables (`t` and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers read from the input.**
This means the values of `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are now the values read from the input, while `t` and `i` retain their original values.
