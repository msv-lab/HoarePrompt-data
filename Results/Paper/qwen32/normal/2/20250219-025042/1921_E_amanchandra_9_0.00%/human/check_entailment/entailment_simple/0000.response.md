### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game played on a checkered board between Alice and Bob, given their initial positions and movement rules. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the relative positions and distances between Alice and Bob's chips and how they can potentially meet or be blocked from meeting.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Initial Position Comparison**: 
   - If Alice's initial row (`xa`) is greater than Bob's initial row (`xb`), Alice is already below Bob. Since Alice can only move downwards and Bob upwards, Alice cannot catch up, and the game ends in a draw.
   
2. **Distance Calculation**:
   - When `xa <= xb`, we calculate the vertical distance `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`. This represents half the number of moves Alice needs to reach Bob's row, assuming optimal play.
   
3. **Horizontal Range Calculation**:
   - Depending on whether the vertical distance is odd or even, we determine the horizontal range within which Alice or Bob can potentially meet.
     - **Odd Vertical Distance**:
       - We calculate `l = max(1, yb - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)`, representing the leftmost and rightmost columns where Alice can be after moving `x + 1` steps vertically.
       - If Alice's column (`ya`) is within this range, she can move to Bob's position, and she wins. Otherwise, it's a draw.
     - **Even Vertical Distance**:
       - We calculate `l = max(1, ya - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)`, representing the leftmost and rightmost columns where Bob can be after moving `x` steps vertically.
       - If Bob's column (`yb`) is within this range, he can move to Alice's position, and he wins. Otherwise, it's a draw.

#### Analysis of the Code:
- The code correctly implements the above logic.
- It checks if `xa > xb` to determine if the game is a draw immediately.
- For `xa <= xb`, it calculates the vertical distance `x` and determines the horizontal range based on whether `x` is odd or even.
- It then checks if Alice or Bob can move into the opponent's position within the calculated range and prints the appropriate result.

### Conclusion:
The provided code accurately reflects the logic needed to determine the outcome of the game based on the given rules and constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

### Your Response:
Reasoning: The code correctly implements the logic to determine the game's outcome based on the initial positions and movement rules of Alice and Bob. It handles all edge cases and provides the correct output for each test case.
Correctness: **True**
