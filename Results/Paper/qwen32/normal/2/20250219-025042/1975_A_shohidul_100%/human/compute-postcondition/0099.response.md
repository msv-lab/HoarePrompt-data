Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6; `check_all` is `True` if `a` was sorted in non-decreasing order up to the point where `a[i-1] > a[i]`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`; at the current index `i`, `a[i-1]` is greater than `a[i]`; `_` is incremented by 1; `new` is a list containing elements from `a[i:]`. If `check_all_new` is `True` and `new_all` is `True`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is also broken.**
