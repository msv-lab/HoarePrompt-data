Given the initial state, we have the following conditions:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` is between 1 and 10^6.
- `check_all` is `False` because the list `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order.
- There exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i - 1] > a[i]`.
- `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from `a[i]` to the end of `a`.
- Either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False` (or both), meaning that either `a[0]` is not greater than or equal to every element in `new`, or `new` is not sorted in non-decreasing order.

The Python code snippet provided is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of the variables described in the initial state. 

Therefore, the output of the code will be:
Output: **NO**
