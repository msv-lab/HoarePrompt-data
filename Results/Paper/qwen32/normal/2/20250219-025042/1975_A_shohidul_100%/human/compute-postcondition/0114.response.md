The code snippet checks if the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order by using the `all` function combined with a list comprehension. This does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `i`, `new`, or `check_all_new`. Instead, it introduces a new variable `new_all` which is set to `True` if every element in `new` is less than or equal to the next element, otherwise `False`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6; `_` is incremented by 1; `i` is `i + 1`; `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index `i` to the end of the list; `check_all_new` is True if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`, otherwise False; `new_all` is True if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise False.**
