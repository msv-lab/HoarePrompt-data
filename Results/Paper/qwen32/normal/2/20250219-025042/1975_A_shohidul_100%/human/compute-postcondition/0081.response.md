To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables based on the conditions provided.

### Loop Analysis
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
- For each iteration, it checks if `a[i - 1] > a[i]`.
- If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, it creates a sublist `new = a[i:]` and checks two conditions:
  - `check_all_new`: Whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`.
  - `new_all`: Whether `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- Depending on these conditions, it prints 'YES' and breaks the loop if both conditions are met; otherwise, it prints 'NO' and breaks the loop.
- If `a[i - 1] <= a[i]`, the loop continues to the next iteration without modifying `check_all`.

### Final Output State
The loop will terminate either when it finds a pair `a[i - 1] > a[i]` and evaluates the conditions, or when it completes all iterations without finding any such pair. In the latter case, `check_all` will remain `True` if the list was initially sorted in non-decreasing order.

Let's summarize the final state:
- `t` remains unchanged (integer between 1 and 1000).
- `n` remains unchanged (integer greater than 1).
- `a` remains unchanged (list of `n` integers).
- `_` is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop.
- `check_all` is `True` if the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order after the loop completes; otherwise, it is `False` if the loop breaks due to finding an unordered pair and evaluating the conditions.

### Conclusion
The final output state depends on whether the list `a` is sorted or not:
- If `a` is sorted, `check_all` remains `True`.
- If `a` is not sorted, `check_all` becomes `False` when the loop breaks.

Given the initial state and the loop behavior, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by user input where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6; `check_all` is `True` if `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `check_all` is `False`; `_` is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop.**
