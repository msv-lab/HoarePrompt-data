The given code checks whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order. The variable `check_all` is assigned the result of this check.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the integer provided by user input; `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by user input where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6; `check_all` is `True` if `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `check_all` is `False`.**
