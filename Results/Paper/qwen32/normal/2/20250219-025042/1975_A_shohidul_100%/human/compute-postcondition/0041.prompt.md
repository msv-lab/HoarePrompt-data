Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the integer provided by user input; `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by user input where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6; `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all_new and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, and `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, there exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i - 1] > a[i]`. Additionally, if `check_all_new` is `True` and `new_all` is `True`, then `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new` (where `new` is a list of integers starting from `a[i]` to the end of `a`) and `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order. Otherwise, either `a[0]` is not greater than or equal to every element in `new`, or `new` is not sorted in non-decreasing order.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i`, `check_all_new` is either `True` or `False` depending on whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of regardless of whether `check_all_new` and `new_all` are `True` or `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is 4. If `a[3]` (which is `a[i-1]`) is greater than `a[4]` (which is `a[i]`), then `new` is a list containing elements from `a[4:]`, `check_all_new` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`, and `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement regardless of whether `check_all_new` and `new_all` are `True` or `False`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
