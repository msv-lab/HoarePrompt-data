The given code snippet checks if the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order. The variable `new_all` is assigned the result of this check.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `n` is greater than 1
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6
- `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order
- There exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i - 1] > a[i]`
- `new` is a list of integers starting from `a[i]` to the end of `a`
- `check_all_new` is a boolean value determined by whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`

The code snippet:
```python
new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
```
will evaluate to `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.

Since `new` starts from an index `i` where `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, it is possible that `new` could be sorted or not sorted. However, without specific values of `a` and `i`, we cannot definitively say whether `new_all` will be `True` or `False`. 

Therefore, the output state will reflect the evaluation of `new_all` based on the condition specified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order, and there exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i - 1] > a[i]; `new` is a list of integers starting from `a[i]` to the end of `a`; `check_all_new` is a boolean value determined by whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`; `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order.**
