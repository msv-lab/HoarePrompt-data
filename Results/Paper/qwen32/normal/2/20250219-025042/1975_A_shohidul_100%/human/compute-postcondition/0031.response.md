To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (this variable is not part of the loop head and does not need adjustment).
- `n` is greater than 1 (this variable is part of the loop head but does not change within the loop).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6 (this variable is not part of the loop head and does not need adjustment).
- `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order (this variable is not part of the loop head and does not need adjustment).
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration (this variable is part of the loop head and needs adjustment).

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

Let's formalize this:

If `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Given that `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration (as per the example logic), at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 4.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is 4**.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, the general form is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is `i + 1`**.

But for clarity and following the pattern of the examples:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

So, if `i` was 3, then:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is 4**.

Generalizing:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is `i + 1`**

For the specific case where `i` was 3:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is 4**.

Thus, the final answer is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is `i + 1`**. 

Or specifically if `i` was 3:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is 4**.
