Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, and `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, there exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i - 1] > a[i]`. Additionally, if `check_all_new` is `True` and `new_all` is `True`, then `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new` (where `new` is a list of integers starting from `a[i]` to the end of `a`) and `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order. Otherwise, either `a[0]` is not greater than or equal to every element in `new`, or `new` is not sorted in non-decreasing order.**
