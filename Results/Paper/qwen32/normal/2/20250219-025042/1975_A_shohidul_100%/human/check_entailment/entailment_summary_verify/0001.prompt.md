You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:]
                    check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])
                    new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])
                    if check_all_new and new_all:
                        print('YES')
                        break
                    else:
                        print('NO')
                        break



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the list `a` can be split into two parts such that the first part is non-decreasing and the second part is both non-decreasing and less than or equal to the first element of the list. It prints "YES" if such a split exists and "NO" otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We have multiple test cases.
- For each test case, we are given an array `a` of `n` positive integers.
- We need to determine if it's possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting it into two parts (prefix and suffix) and swapping them.
- The program should output "Yes" if it's possible to sort the array using the described operation, otherwise "No".

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Checking if Already Sorted:**
   - The program first checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the condition `all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`. If true, it prints "YES" and moves to the next test case.

3. **Checking for Possible Sorting:**
   - If the array is not initially sorted, the program iterates through the array to find the first position `i` where `a[i - 1] > a[i]`.
   - Once such a position is found, it creates a new subarray `new` starting from index `i` to the end of the array.
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - `check_all_new`: Ensures that the first element of the original array `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in the new subarray `new`.
     - `new_all`: Ensures that the new subarray `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES" and breaks out of the loop.
   - If either condition fails, it prints "NO" and breaks out of the loop.

### Issues with the Provided Program:
- **Incorrect Logic for Checking Possible Sorting:**
  - The logic used to determine if the array can be sorted by swapping a prefix and suffix is flawed.
  - The program only checks if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to every element in the new subarray and if the new subarray is sorted. This is not sufficient to determine if the entire array can be sorted by any number of swaps.
  - For example, consider the array `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`. The program would incorrectly identify the first unsorted pair at `i=1` and check if `[3] >= [1, 4, 1, 5]` and if `[1, 4, 1, 5]` is sorted, which is not the correct approach.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by the described operation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
