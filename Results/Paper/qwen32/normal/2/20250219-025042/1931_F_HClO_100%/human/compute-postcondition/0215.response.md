The code snippet assigns the list `l1` to the variable `l`. This means `l` now holds the same list as `l1`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `idx1` is either `n-1` or `-1`, `idx2` is not `-1`, `p1` is `0` or `1`, `p2` is `0` or `1`, `val` is an empty list, `l1` has `a1` inserted at position `idx2`. If `idx1` was `n-2`, it is now `n-1`. If `idx1` was `-1`, it remains `-1`. `l` is equal to `l1`.**
