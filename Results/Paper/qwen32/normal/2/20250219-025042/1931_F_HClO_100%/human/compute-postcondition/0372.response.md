The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'no'`. The initial state provides some context about the variables `val`, `m`, `l3`, and `l`, but these variables do not affect the execution of the `print` statement itself. The `print` statement is independent of the values of these variables and will always output the string `'no'`.

Here's the breakdown:

- `val` contains at least one tuple of the form `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is an integer and `l3` is a list.
- `m` is at least 3.
- The current value of `l3` is not equal to the list obtained by removing all occurrences of `a3` from another list `l`.

None of these conditions influence the `print` statement, which simply outputs the string `'no'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **no**
