The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into integers, assigns the first integer to `a2`, and the rest to `l2`. This operation does not affect the previously mentioned variables `n`, `m`, `a1`, and `l1`.

Output State: **The loop completes all iterations and prints 'yes'. `n` and `m` are the integers read from the input. If `m` is equal to 1, the same state is maintained. Otherwise, the same state is also maintained since there is no else part to alter the state. `a1` is the first integer from the input, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input. `a2` is the first integer from the new input, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input.**
