Output State: **`t` is the same as at the end of the previous iteration; `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration in a loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, `t`, `n`, and `m` retain their values as described in the initial state.
