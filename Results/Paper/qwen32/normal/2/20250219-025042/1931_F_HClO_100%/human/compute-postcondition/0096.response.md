The code snippet `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the value of `a1` at the position `idx2` in the list `l1`. This means that the element currently at `idx2` and all elements following it in `l1` will be shifted one position to the right.

Given the initial state, `l1` is a list of integers excluding those equal to `a2`. After the insertion, `l1` will have `a1` inserted at the position `idx2`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer input provided such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer that either equals 2 or is greater than or equal to 3 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`; `a2` is the first integer from the subsequent input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the subsequent input line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` (before the insertion) except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; `idx1` is `n - 2` if `idx2` was initially -1 and `idx1` was not -1, otherwise `idx1` remains unchanged; `idx2` is not -1; `p1` is 1; `p2` is 1; `i` is `n - 3`; `val` is an empty list; `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`; `a3` is the first integer from the new input line; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`.**
