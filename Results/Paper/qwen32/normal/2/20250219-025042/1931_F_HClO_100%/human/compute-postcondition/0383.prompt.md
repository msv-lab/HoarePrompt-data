Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `val` contains `m - 2` tuples of the form `(a3, l3)` where each `a3` is the first integer from each input line and `l3` is the list of remaining integers from each input line.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `val` contains at least one tuple of the form `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is an integer and `l3` is a list. `m` is at least 3. If `l3` is not equal to the list obtained by removing all occurrences of `a3` from another list `l`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `val` contains at least two tuples of the form `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is an integer and `l3` is a list, and `m` is at least 3. If `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `val` contains at least one tuple of the form `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is an integer and `l3` is a list, and `m` is at least 3. If `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined as there is no else part.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
