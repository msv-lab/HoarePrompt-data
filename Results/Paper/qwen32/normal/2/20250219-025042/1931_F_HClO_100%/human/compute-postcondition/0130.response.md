In this case, the loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable, meaning it is not used within the loop body. The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is a variable representing the total number of iterations.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust the state such that the loop can execute one more time if possible. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, but since it is not used, we don't need to change its value. Instead, we need to ensure that the loop counter `t` is decremented correctly.

Let's break down the steps:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have decremented `t` by 1.
2. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration minus 1, but since we are describing the state before the decrement happens, `t` should remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `t` is unchanged from the end of the previous iteration.

State: **the output state you calculate, `t` is the same as at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since the exact value of `t` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`t` is the same as at the end of the previous iteration**.
