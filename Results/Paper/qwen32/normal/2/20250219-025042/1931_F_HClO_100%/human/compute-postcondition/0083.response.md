The code snippet `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value of `a2` into the list `l2` at the position specified by `idx1`. This operation modifies the list `l2` by adding one element before the element that was originally at `idx1`.

Given the initial state, `l2` is a list of integers, and `a2` is an integer. After the insertion, `l2` will have one more element, and the elements that were originally at `idx1` and beyond will be shifted one position to the right.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer input provided such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` remains an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `m` remains an integer that must be greater than or equal to 3 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`.
- `a1` remains the first integer from the new input line.
- `l1` remains a list of the remaining integers from the new input line.
- `a2` remains the first integer from the subsequent input line.
- `l2` is now a list containing all the original elements of `l2` with `a2` inserted at position `idx1`.
- `l11` remains a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`.
- `l22` remains a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`.
- `idx1` remains `n - 2` if `idx2` was initially -1 and `idx1` was not -1, otherwise `idx1` remains unchanged.
- `idx2` remains not -1.
- `p1` remains 1.
- `p2` remains 1.
- `i` remains `n - 3`.
- `val` remains an empty list.
- `idx1` remains less than `idx2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input provided such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 3 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the subsequent input line; `l2` is a list containing all the original elements of `l2` with `a2` inserted at position `idx1`; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; `idx1` is `n - 2` if `idx2` was initially -1 and `idx1` was not -1, otherwise `idx1` remains unchanged; `idx2` is not -1; `p1` is 1; `p2` is 1; `i` is `n - 3`; `val` is an empty list; and `idx1` is less than `idx2`.**
