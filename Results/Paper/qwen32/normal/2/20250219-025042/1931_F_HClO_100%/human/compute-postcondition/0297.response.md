Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 2, `m` are the integers read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`, and `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the loop continues without consuming any additional lines of input. If `idx1` and `idx2` are both greater than or equal to 0, indicating that `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1` for some `i`, then the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the loop or if statement does not break.**
