Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `m` are the integers read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`, and `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the loop continues without consuming any additional lines of input. `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0.`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be at least 2, `m` are the integers read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`, and `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the loop continues without consuming any additional lines of input. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, `idx1` and `idx2` retain their original values, and the loop or if statement does not break. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are set to `i`, `p1` and `p2` remain 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `idx1` and `idx2` retain their original values, and the loop or if statement does not break.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be at least 5, `m` are the integers read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`, and `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the loop continues without consuming any additional lines of input. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, `idx1` and `idx2` retain their original values, and the loop or if statement does not break. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are set to `i`, `p1` and `p2` remain 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, then `idx1` is set to 4 and `p1` is 1. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`, then `idx2` is set to 4 and `p2` is 1. `i` is 4. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, if `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be at least 5, `m` are the integers read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`, and `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, `idx1` and `idx2` retain their original values. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are set to `i`, `p1` and `p2` remain 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, then `idx1` is set to 4 and `p1` is set to 1. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`, then `idx2` is set to 4 and `p2` is set to 1. `i` is 5. If `idx1` and `idx2` are both greater than or equal to 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
