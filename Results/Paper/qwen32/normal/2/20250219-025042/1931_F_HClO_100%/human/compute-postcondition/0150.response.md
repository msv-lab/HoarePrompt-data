The given code snippet initializes two variables, `idx1` and `idx2`, both to the value `-1`. This does not affect any of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`) as they are not modified by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is the same as at the end of the previous iteration; `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input where `m` must be greater than or equal to 3; `a1` is the first integer from the new input; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input; `a2` is the first integer from the latest input; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`; `idx1` is -1; `idx2` is -1`.**
