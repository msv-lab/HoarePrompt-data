The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `p1`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the value of `n` remains greater than 1, `i` remains 0, `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`, and `idx1` remains 0.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`, `idx1` is 0, `p1` is 1.**
