In this task, the loop variable is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a variable whose value is intentionally ignored. The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of iterations specified.

Given that the loop has just completed all its iterations and printed 'yes', it means that the loop variable `_` has already taken on all values from `0` to `t-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` would need to be incremented, but since `t` is not part of the loop head (it's the range limit), we cannot adjust `t` directly based on the loop head alone.

However, if we consider the logical continuation, the loop variable `_` would need to be reset to `0` and `t` would need to be incremented to allow another complete set of iterations. But strictly adhering to the instruction to only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we can only consider the loop variable `_`.

Since the loop has just finished, the loop variable `_` would logically be out of range if we were to continue without changing `t`. To start a new iteration, `_` would need to be reset to `0` hypothetically, but given the constraints, we acknowledge that no further adjustments can be made to `_` to restart the loop without changing `t`.

Therefore, under the given constraints:

State: **the loop completes all iterations and prints 'yes'** (no change possible to the loop variable `_` to start a new iteration without changing `t`)
