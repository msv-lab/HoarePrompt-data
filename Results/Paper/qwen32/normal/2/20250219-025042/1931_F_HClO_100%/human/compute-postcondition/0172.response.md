Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, the following conditions apply: if `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, then `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`, then `idx1` is 0 and `p1` is 1. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`, then `idx2` is 0 and `p2` is 1. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `l2[i + p2]`, no changes occur to `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, or `p2`.**
