The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times. The loop will execute `m - 2` times. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop progresses.

Given that the loop iterates `m - 2` times, the loop variable `_` does not affect the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`). However, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that the loop counter is correctly set up.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have completed some iterations, and the loop variable `_` would have been incremented. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` should be one less than the total number of iterations required (`m - 2`).

Let's denote the current value of `_` (after the previous iteration) as `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be `m - 3` (since the loop will increment `_` to `m - 2` in the next iteration).

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `_` should be `m - 3`.

State: **`t` is the same as at the end of the previous iteration; `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input where `m` must be greater than or equal to 3; `a1` is the first integer from the new input; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input; `a2` is the first integer from the latest input; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`; `_` is `m - 3`**
