To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(m - 2):`, which means the only variable that can be directly influenced is the loop counter `_`. However, since `_` is a throwaway variable (not used within the loop body), we don't need to adjust it.

The loop will continue to execute as long as the range `(m - 2)` has more elements. This means that `m - 2` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute another iteration. Given that `m` must be greater than 2 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `m` remains such that `m - 2` is still greater than 0 for the next iteration.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `m` must be greater than 2.
2. For the loop to execute again, `m - 2` must be greater than 0, which implies `m` must be greater than 2.
3. The variables `a3`, `l3`, and `val` are not part of the loop head and thus should remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `m` is still greater than 2, while `a3`, `l3`, and `val` remain the same.

State: **`m` must be greater than 2; `a3` is the first integer from the input; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input; `val` includes the tuple `(a3, l3)`**
