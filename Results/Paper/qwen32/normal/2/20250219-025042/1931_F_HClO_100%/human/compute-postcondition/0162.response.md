The code assigns the value of `i` to `idx1`. Given that `i` is 0, `idx1` will also be 0. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`, `idx1` is 0.**
