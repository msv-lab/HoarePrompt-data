To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions described:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t`: An integer input provided such that `t >= 1`.
- `n`: An integer read from the input such that `n >= 2`.
- `m`: An integer that must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `a1`: The first integer from a new input line.
- `a2`: The first integer from the subsequent input line.
- `l11`: A list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`.
- `l22`: A list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`.
- `idx1`: Initially set to `n - 2` if `idx2` was initially -1 and `idx1` was not -1, otherwise it remains unchanged.
- `idx2`: Not -1.
- `p1`: Set to 1.
- `p2`: Set to 1.
- `i`: Set to `n - 3`.
- `val`: Contains `m-2` tuples `(a3, l3)`.
- `l`: A list containing all the original elements of `l2` with `a2` inserted at position `idx1` if `idx1 < idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`.
- `a3`: The next `a3_next` from `val`.
- `l3`: The next `l3_next` from `val`.

### Conditions and Logic:
- If `l3` is not equal to the list of elements in `l` excluding `a3`, the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- The `print('no')` statement is outside of any conditional blocks that would prevent it from executing, meaning it will execute regardless of the conditions inside the loops or if statements.

### Conclusion:
Given that the `print('no')` statement is not within any conditional block that could prevent it from executing and there is no information suggesting that the execution flow would skip this statement, the output will simply be the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
