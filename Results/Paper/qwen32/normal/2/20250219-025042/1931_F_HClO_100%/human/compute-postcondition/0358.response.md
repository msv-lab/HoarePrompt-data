Postcondition: **`idx1` and `idx2` will be set to the index where the first mismatch occurs with the specified conditions, or the loop will break when `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`. If `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, `idx1` is not `-1`, and `idx2` is `n - 2` if it was `-1` before the insertion, otherwise `idx2` remains the same. If `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, `idx1` is not `-1`, and `idx2` is `-1` or `n - 2` depending on the condition. In both cases, `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged, and `val` is either an empty list or `[(a3, l3)]` where `a3` is the first integer from the input and `l3` is the list of remaining integers. If `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, `l1` has `a1` inserted at index `idx2` and `l` is equal to `l1`. If `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, `l1` has `a1` inserted at index `idx2` and `l` is equal to `l1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l2` has `a2` inserted at index `idx1` and `l` is equal to `l2`. If `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, `m` is decreased by 1.**
