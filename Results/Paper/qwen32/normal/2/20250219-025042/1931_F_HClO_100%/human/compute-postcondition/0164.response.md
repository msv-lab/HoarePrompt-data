Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`. Additionally, `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`. Furthermore, either `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` or `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`**. 

To simplify while retaining all necessary conditions:

Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`.**
