Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n-2`, `idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`, `idx2` is not `-1`, `p1` is `0` or `1`, `p2` is `0` or `1`. If `idx1 < idx2`, then `a2` is inserted into `l2` at the position `idx1`, and `l` is `l2`. If `idx1 > idx2`, then `val` is an empty list and `l1` has `a1` inserted at position `idx2`. If `idx1` was `n-2`, it is now `n-1`; if `idx1` was `-1`, it remains `-1`. If `idx1 <= idx2`, then `val` is `[(a3, l3)]`, where `a3` is the first integer from the input and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input. If `l3.index(a1) < l3.index(a2)`, then `l` has `a1` inserted at position `idx2`. Otherwise, `l` has `a2` inserted at position `idx1`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `n-2`, `idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`, `idx2` is not `-1`, `p1` is `0` or `1`, `p2` is `0` or `1`, `m` is at least 2, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` includes the tuple `(a3, l3)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n-2`, `idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`, `idx2` is not `-1`, `p1` is `0` or `1`, `p2` is `0` or `1`, `m` is at least 3, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` includes the tuple `(a3, l3)` and the newly appended tuple `(a3, l3)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n-2`, `idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`, `idx2` is not `-1`, `p1` is `0` or `1`, `p2` is `0` or `1`, `m` is at least 3, `a3` is the first integer from the new input (e.g., 7), `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input (e.g., [8, 9]), `val` includes the tuple `(a3, l3)` twice




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
