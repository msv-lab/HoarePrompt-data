The code snippet creates a new list `l11` that contains all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`. This means that `l11` is a filtered version of `l1`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `l11`, which is derived from `l1` and `a2`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input provided such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from the input; if `m` is 1, then `m` remains 1; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the subsequent input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the subsequent input line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`.**
