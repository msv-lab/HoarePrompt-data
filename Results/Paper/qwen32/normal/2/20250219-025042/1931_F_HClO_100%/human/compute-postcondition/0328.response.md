To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the provided information step-by-step.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.
- `a1` is the first integer from the first input line.
- `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the first input line.
- `a2` is the first integer from the second input line.
- `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the second input line.
- `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`.
- `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`.
- If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the loop continues.
- `idx1` and `idx2` are initialized to -1.
- `p1` and `p2` are initialized to 0.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop runs `n-1` times, but it can break early under certain conditions:
1. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the loop breaks.
2. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]` and `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are set to `i`, and the loop breaks.
3. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]` and `l1[i + p1] == a2`, then `idx1` is set to `i`, and `p1` is set to 1.
4. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]` and `l1[i + p1] != a2`, then `idx2` is set to `i`, and `p2` is set to 1.
5. If `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, the loop breaks.

### Observations from Provided Outputs:
- After 1 iteration: The loop did not break, and `idx1` and `idx2` remained -1.
- After 2 iterations: The loop did not break, and `idx1` and `idx2` remained -1.
- After 3 iterations: The loop did not break, and `idx1` and `idx2` remained -1.

### Final Output State:
Since the loop did not break after 3 iterations, it will continue until one of the breaking conditions is met. Given that `idx1` and `idx2` are still -1 after 3 iterations, we need to consider the following scenarios:
- If `i + max(p1, p2)` reaches `n - 1`, the loop will break.
- If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1` at some point, `idx1` and `idx2` will be set to `i`, and the loop will break.
- If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` or `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1` at some point, `idx1` or `idx2` will be set to `i`, and `p1` or `p2` will be set to 1. If both `idx1` and `idx2` become non-negative, the loop will break.

However, based on the given outputs, the loop has not yet reached a breaking condition after 3 iterations. Therefore, the loop will continue until one of the breaking conditions is met.

### Conclusion:
The loop will continue until one of the breaking conditions is satisfied. Since we don't have more specific information about the lists `l1` and `l2`, we can only conclude that the loop will eventually break when one of the conditions is met.

Output State: **`idx1` and `idx2` will be set to the index where the first mismatch occurs with the specified conditions, or the loop will break when `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`. The exact values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` depend on the specific values in `l1` and `l2`.**

In simpler terms: The loop will continue until it finds a mismatch that meets the specified conditions or until it has iterated enough times to reach the end of the possible iterations (`n-1`). The exact final values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` depend on the input lists `l1` and `l2`.
