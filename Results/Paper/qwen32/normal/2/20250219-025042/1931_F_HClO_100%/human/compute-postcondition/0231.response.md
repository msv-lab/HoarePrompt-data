Postcondition: **`i` is `n-2`, `idx1` is either `n-1` or `-1`, `idx2` is not `-1`, `p1` is `0` or `1`, `p2` is `0` or `1`. If `idx1 > idx2`, then `val` is an empty list and `l1` has `a1` inserted at position `idx2`. If `idx1` was `n-2`, it is now `n-1`; if `idx1` was `-1`, it remains `-1`. If `idx1 <= idx2`, then `val` is `[(a3, l3)]`, where `a3` is the first integer from the input and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input. If `l3.index(a1) < l3.index(a2)`, then `l` has `a1` inserted at position `idx2`. Otherwise, `l` has `a2` inserted at position `idx1`.**
