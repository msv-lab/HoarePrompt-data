The code appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. This means that `val` now contains one additional element, which is the tuple `(a3, l3)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`, `idx2` is not `-1`, `p1` is `0` or `1`, `p2` is `0` or `1`, `m` is at least 3, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` includes the tuple `(a3, l3)` and the newly appended tuple `(a3, l3)`**.
