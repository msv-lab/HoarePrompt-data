`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. After the execution of the code, the value of `t` will be the integer input provided, and the conditions on `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) remain valid.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input provided such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.**
