Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input provided such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer that either equals 2 or is greater than or equal to 3 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the subsequent input line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; `idx1` is `n - 2` if `idx2` was initially -1 and `idx1` was not -1, otherwise `idx1` remains unchanged; `idx2` is not -1; `p1` is 1; `p2` is 1; `i` is `n - 3`; `val` is an empty list; `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`; `a3` is the first integer from the new input line; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line. If the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, then `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`. Otherwise, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the subsequent input line with `a2` inserted at position `idx1`.**
