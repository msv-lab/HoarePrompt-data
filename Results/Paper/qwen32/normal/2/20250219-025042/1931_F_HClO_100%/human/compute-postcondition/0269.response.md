The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not represent any state that needs to be adjusted. The loop's continuation depends on the value of `m`.

Given the loop statement `for _ in range(m - 2):`, the loop will execute as long as `m - 2` is greater than 0. Since `m` must be greater than 2, the loop will execute `m - 2` times.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have completed one iteration, so the number of remaining iterations is `m - 3`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that the loop will continue if there are still iterations left, i.e., `m - 3` should be greater than 0.

State: **`n` and `m` are the integers read from the input, `m` must be greater than 3, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`. No new variables are introduced or modified.**
