Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `idx2` is 2, `p2` is 1. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change occurs.**

Natural Language: The value of `p2` has been updated to 1. All other variables retain their original values and conditions.
