Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of participants and `k` is the number of screenshots. It also receives `k` lines, each containing `n` distinct integers representing the order of participants seen in the screenshots, with the first integer in each line being the author of the screenshot. The function returns the number of unique authors across all test cases.**
