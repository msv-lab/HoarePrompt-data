t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the product n · k does not exceed 2 · 10^5. For each test case, there are k lines, each containing n distinct integers a_{ij} such that 1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n, representing the order of participants seen in the screenshots, with a_{i0} being the author of the screenshot and always appearing at the top of the list. All screenshot authors are distinct across the test cases.
