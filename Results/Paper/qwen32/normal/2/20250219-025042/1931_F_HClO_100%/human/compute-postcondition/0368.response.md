The code appends a new tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Initially, `val` contains two tuples `((a3, l3), (a3, l3))`. After appending, `val` will contain three tuples.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 3; `a3` is the first integer from the new input; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input; `val` includes the tuples `((a3, l3), (a3, l3), (a3, l3))`**
