Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, then `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`. Otherwise, `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`. Both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative integers. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, then `idx1` is 0 and `p1` is 1. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`, then `idx2` is 0 and `p2` is 1.**
