Output State: **`t` is an integer input provided such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 3 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the subsequent input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the subsequent input line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; `idx1` is `i`; `idx2` is `i`; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0`. Additionally, `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language Explanation: The values of the variables remain unchanged, but we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
