The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and assigns the first integer to `a1` and the rest to `l1`. Given the initial state, the only changes are the assignment of values to `a1` and `l1`.

Output State: **The loop completes all iterations and prints 'yes'. `n` and `m` are the integers read from the input. If `m` is equal to 1, the same state is maintained. Otherwise, the same state is also maintained since there is no else part to alter the state. `a1` is the first integer from the input, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input.**
