The `continue` statement does not affect the values of any variables. It is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop structure provided in the given context, the `continue` statement here does nothing and the state of all variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input provided such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from the input; `m` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 3; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the subsequent input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the subsequent input line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`. Additionally, `l11` is not equal to `l22`.**
