To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state before the for loop starts, let's analyze the given loop:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop iterates over the range starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. For the loop to execute even once, `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 1 at the start of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `max` is 0.

We need to adjust the state based on the loop head requirements. Specifically, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `max` is 0, `i` is 1** 

However, since `i` is initialized within the loop and not before it, we don't need to explicitly set `i` in the pre-loop state. Thus, the final adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `max` is 0**
