The given code snippet assigns a value to `a[n - 1 - idx]`. The value being assigned is `(x - prev) // 2`, which is also the value of `a[idx]` according to the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is the next element in the `odds` list.
- `prev` holds the previous value of `x`.
- `idx` specifies the position in the list `a`.
- `a[idx]` is `(x - prev) // 2`.

The code modifies `a[n - 1 - idx]` to be equal to `(x - prev) // 2`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`x` is the next element in the `odds` list; `prev` holds its previous value; `idx` specifies the position in the list `a`; `a[idx]` is `(x - prev) // 2`; `a[n - 1 - idx]` is `(x - prev) // 2`.**

This means that the value at the position `n - 1 - idx` in the list `a` is now set to the same value as `a[idx]`, which is `(x - prev) // 2`. All other variables retain their original values.
