The code appends the value of `sm` to the list `cts`. No other variables are modified directly by this code snippet. Therefore, the value of `a` remains a list of positive integers with at least 3 elements, `i` remains 2, `j` remains 3, and `sm` remains `sm` + `a[3]`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of positive integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `sm` is `sm` + `a[3]`, `cts` has an additional element which is the value of `sm`.**
