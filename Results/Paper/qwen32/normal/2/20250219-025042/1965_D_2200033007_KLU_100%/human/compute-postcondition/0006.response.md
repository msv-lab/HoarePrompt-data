To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head:

```python
while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition 1:** `len(smallList) > 0`
   - This means `smallList` must contain at least one element.

2. **Condition 2:** `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`
   - This means the last element of `bigList` must be equal to the last element of `smallList`.

### Current State:
- `bigList` is `[1, 2]`
- `smallList` is `[1]`

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Check Condition 1:**
   - Currently, `smallList` has one element (`[1]`), so `len(smallList) > 0` is satisfied.

2. **Check Condition 2:**
   - The last element of `bigList` is `2`.
   - The last element of `smallList` is `1`.
   - Since `2 != 1`, `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]` is not satisfied.

### Required Adjustments:
To satisfy both conditions, we need to ensure that the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal. One way to achieve this is to change the last element of `bigList` to match the last element of `smallList`.

### Modified State:
- Change the last element of `bigList` from `2` to `1`.

Thus, the modified state should be:
- `bigList` is `[1, 1]`
- `smallList` is `[1]`

### Final Answer:
State: **`bigList` is `[1, 1]`, `smallList` is `[1]`**
