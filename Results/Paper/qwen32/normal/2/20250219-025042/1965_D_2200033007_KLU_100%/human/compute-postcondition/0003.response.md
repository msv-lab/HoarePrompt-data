To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop:

```
while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions are true:
1. `len(smallList) > 0`: The length of `smallList` must be greater than 0.
2. `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`: The last element of `bigList` must be equal to the last element of `smallList`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `bigList` is `[1, 2, 3]`
- `smallList` is `[1, 2]`

Let's analyze the conditions:
1. `len(smallList) > 0`: This condition is already true since `smallList` has 2 elements.
2. `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`: This condition is false because `bigList[-1]` is `3` and `smallList[-1]` is `2`.

Since the second condition is false, the loop will not execute again with the current state. To make the loop execute one more time, we need to adjust the state so that both conditions are true.

### Adjustments Needed:
- We need to ensure that `bigList[-1]` is equal to `smallList[-1]`. Since `smallList[-1]` is `2`, we should set `bigList[-1]` to `2`.
- Alternatively, we could adjust `smallList[-1]` to match `bigList[-1]`, but since we are only allowed to adjust the states of objects in the loop head (`len(smallList)` and `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`), we'll focus on adjusting `bigList`.

### Adjusted State:
- `bigList` should be `[1, 2, 2]` (changing the last element from `3` to `2`).
- `smallList` remains `[1, 2]`.

State: **`bigList` is `[1, 2, 2]`, `smallList` is `[1, 2]`**
