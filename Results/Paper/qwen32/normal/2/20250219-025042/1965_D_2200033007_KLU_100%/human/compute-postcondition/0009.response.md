Output State: **bigList is [1], smallList is [].**

In natural language, after all the iterations of the loop have finished, `bigList` contains only the element `1`, and `smallList` is empty. This means that the loop successfully removed matching elements from the end of both lists three times, leaving `bigList` with its first element and `smallList` completely emptied.
