#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of positive integers representing a palindrome array.
def func_1(a):
    cts = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        sm = 0
        
        for j in range(i, len(a)):
            sm = sm + a[j]
            cts.append(sm)
        
    #State: `a` remains a list of positive integers representing a palindrome array, and `cts` contains all cumulative sums starting from each index `i` to the end of the list `a`.
    cts.sort()
    return cts
    #The program returns `cts` which is sorted in ascending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of positive integers `a` and returns a sorted list `cts` containing all cumulative sums of subarrays starting from each index `i` to the end of the list `a`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: cts is a list of integers.
def func_2(cts):
    odds = []
    for ct in cts:
        if len(odds) > 0 and ct == odds[-1]:
            odds.pop()
        else:
            odds.append(ct)
        
    #State: - `cts`: Remains unchanged as it is the input list.
    #- `odds`: Contains the elements of `cts` with consecutive duplicates removed.
    #
    #### Example:
    #If `cts = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]`, the loop will produce `odds = [1, 3, 4]` because:
    #- Start with `odds = []`
    #- Add `1` → `odds = [1]`
    #- Add `2` → `odds = [1, 2]`
    #- Skip `2` because it matches the last element of `odds` → `odds = [1]`
    #- Add `3` → `odds = [1, 3]`
    #- Skip `3` because it matches the last element of `odds` → `odds = [1]`
    #- Skip `3` because it matches the last element of `odds` → `odds = [1]`
    #- Add `4` → `odds = [1, 4]`
    #
    #However, the correct sequence should be `odds = [1, 3, 4]` as per the logic described.
    #
    #Thus, the final output state is:
    #
    #Output State:
    return odds
    #The program returns `odds`, which contains the elements of `cts` with consecutive duplicates removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns a new list with consecutive duplicate integers removed.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: odds is a list of integers representing the odd-indexed subarray sums in descending order, and n is an integer representing the size of the palindrome array a, where n is an odd integer and 3 <= n <= 1000.
def func_3(odds, n):
    a = [0] * n
    prev = 0
    idx = (n - 1) // 2
    for x in odds:
        if idx == n - 1 - idx:
            a[idx] = x
        else:
            a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
            a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        
        prev = x
        
        idx = idx - 1
        
    #State: 
    return a
    #The program returns the value of variable 'a'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes a list of integers `odds` and an integer `n` as input. It constructs and returns a palindrome array `a` of size `n` based on the values in `odds`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: bigList and smallList are lists of integers. bigList contains all the subarray sums of a palindrome array, and smallList contains all but one of those subarray sums. The last elements of bigList and smallList are compared and removed if they are equal until either smallList is empty or the last elements differ.
def func_4(bigList, smallList):
    while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
        bigList.pop()
        
        smallList.pop()
        
    #State: bigList is [1], smallList is [].
    return bigList[-1]
    #The program returns 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists of integers, `bigList` and `smallList`. It repeatedly removes the last elements of both lists if they are equal until `smallList` is empty or the last elements differ. The function then returns the last element of `bigList`.
