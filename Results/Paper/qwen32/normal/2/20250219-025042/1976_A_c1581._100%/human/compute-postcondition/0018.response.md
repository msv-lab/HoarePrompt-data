The code snippet `letters.sort()` sorts the list `letters` in ascending order. Since `letters` initially contains all the lowercase Latin letters from the password in the order they appear, after sorting, `letters` will contain these letters in alphabetical order.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the password in ascending order; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the password in alphabetical order.**
