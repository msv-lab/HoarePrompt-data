Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `password` is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the password in ascending order; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the password in alphabetical order.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(digits)):
    if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
        return False
    if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
        return False


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`; `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the password in ascending order and must have at least one digit; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the password in alphabetical order. Additionally, either `i` is not less than `len(digits) - 1` or `digits[i]` is not greater than `digits[i + 1]`. Either `i` is greater than or equal to `len(letters)` or `digits[-1]` is less than or equal to `letters[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`; `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the password in ascending order and has at least one digit; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the password in alphabetical order; `i` is `i + 1`. If `i < len(letters)` and `digits[-1] > letters[i]`, the program returns False. Otherwise, the program does not return and continues execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`; `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the password in ascending order and has at least one digit; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the password in alphabetical order; `i` is `i + 1`. If `i < len(letters)` and `digits[-1] > letters[i]`, the program returns False. Otherwise, the program does not return and continues execution.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
