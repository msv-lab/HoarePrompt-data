Postcondition: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`; `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the password in ascending order and must have at least one digit; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the password in alphabetical order. The current index `i` satisfies `i < len(digits) - 1` and the value of `digits[i]` is greater than `digits[i + 1]`.**
