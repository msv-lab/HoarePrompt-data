The code initializes an empty list named `digits`. This does not affect the value of `password` or the integer `n`.

Output State: **password is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `digits` is an empty list.**
