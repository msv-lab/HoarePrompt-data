Postcondition: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters (where `n â‰¥ 1`), `char` is the next character in the `password` string following the previously processed `char`. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list that now includes `char` as its last element. Otherwise, `letters` is a list that now includes `char` appended to it.**
