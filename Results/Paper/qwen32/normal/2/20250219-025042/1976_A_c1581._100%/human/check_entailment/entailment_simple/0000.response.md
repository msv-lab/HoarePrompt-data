### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates through each one.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password and the password itself.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` separates the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - It sorts both lists individually.
   - It then checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order (which is redundant since we just sorted it).
   - It checks if the last digit in the `digits` list is less than or equal to every letter in the `letters` list.
   - Finally, it constructs a new password by concatenating the sorted `digits` and `letters` lists and compares this with the original password.

3. **Checking Conditions**:
   - The program ensures that all digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It ensures that all letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It ensures that no digit comes after a letter by checking that the largest digit is less than or equal to every letter.

4. **Comparison with Original Password**:
   - If the constructed sorted password matches the original password, it means the original password was already in the required format, and the function returns `True`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Issues:
- The check `if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:` is unnecessary because the `digits` list is already sorted.
- The main issue is the check `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:`. This check is flawed because it only compares the last digit with the first letter, which is not sufficient to ensure that no digit comes after any letter in the original password. We need to ensure that there are no digits after any letters in the original password.

### Corrected Check:
To correctly ensure that no digit comes after a letter, we need to iterate through the password and check that once we encounter a letter, no digits should follow.

Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    seen_letter = False
    for i in range(len(password)):
        if password[i].isdigit():
            if seen_letter:
                return False
        else:
            seen_letter = True
    digits = [char for char in password if char.isdigit()]
    letters = [char for char in password if char.isalpha()]
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    sorted_password = ''.join(digits + letters)
    return sorted_password == password
```

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the original program does not correctly implement the problem requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the original program is:

Correctness: **False**
