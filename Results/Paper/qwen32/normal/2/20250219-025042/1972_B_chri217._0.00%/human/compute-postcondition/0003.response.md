Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of 'U' and 'D' characters, representing the state of `n` coins where each character corresponds to whether a coin is facing up ('U') or facing down ('D'). The length of `s`, denoted as `n`, satisfies 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `num_up` is the count of 'U' characters in `s`. `num_up` is even**
