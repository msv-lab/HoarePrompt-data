### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic behind the function `func_1(s)` and see if it aligns with the rules of the game described in the problem statement.

The key insight here is the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`):

1. **Game Dynamics:**
   - Each move involves removing a `'U'` and flipping its adjacent coins.
   - The game ends when there are no more `'U'` coins left.
   - The winner is the player who makes the last valid move, i.e., the one who leaves the opponent without any `'U'` coins to flip.

2. **Parity Analysis:**
   - If the number of `'U'` coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position where the number of `'U'` coins remains odd after his turn.
   - Conversely, if the number of `'U'` coins is even, Bob can always force Alice into a position where the number of `'U'` coins remains even after her turn.
   - This is because each move reduces the number of `'U'` coins by exactly one, changing the parity from odd to even or vice versa.
   - Since the game ends when there are no `'U'` coins left (an even count), the player who starts with an odd number of `'U'` coins will always be able to make the last move and win.

3. **Function Logic:**
   - The function `func_1(s)` counts the number of `'U'` coins in the string `s`.
   - If this count is odd, it returns `'YES'`, indicating Alice's win.
   - If this count is even, it returns `'NO'`, indicating Bob's win.

Given this analysis, the function correctly implements the strategy based on the parity of the number of `'U'` coins, ensuring that the player who starts with an odd number of `'U'` coins will win if both players play optimally.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct as it accurately reflects the optimal strategy for the game based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.

**Correctness:** **True**
