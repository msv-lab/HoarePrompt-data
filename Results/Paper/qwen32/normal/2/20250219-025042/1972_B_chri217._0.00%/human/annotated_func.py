#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of 'U' and 'D' characters, representing the state of n coins where each character corresponds to whether a coin is facing up ('U') or facing down ('D'). The length of s, denoted as n, satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
def func_1(s):
    num_up = s.count('U')
    if (num_up % 2 == 1) :
        return 'YES'
        #The program returns 'YES'
    else :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input, which consists of 'U' and 'D' characters representing the states of coins (facing up or down). It returns 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters in the string is odd, and 'NO' if the number of 'U' characters is even.
