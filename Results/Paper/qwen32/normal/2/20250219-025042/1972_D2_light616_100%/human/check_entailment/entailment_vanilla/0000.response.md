Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

### Code Analysis
The code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

#### Function `func_1`
- This function reads a pair of integers \(n\) and \(m\).
- It initializes a counter `cnt` to zero.
- It uses nested loops to iterate over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) where \(x\) and \(y\) represent potential values of \(a\) and \(b\).
- The outer loop runs while \(x \cdot x \leq n\).
- The inner loop runs while \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
- Inside the inner loop, it checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). If true, it increments the counter by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).
- Finally, it prints the counter value.

#### Function `func_2`
- This function reads the number of test cases \(t\).
- It calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Issues with the Code
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Loop Conditions**: The loop conditions do not cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\). Specifically, the condition `while x * x <= n` and `while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m` are too restrictive and do not consider all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Incorrect Pair Counting**: The logic inside the loop assumes that if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), then the number of valid pairs can be counted using the formula `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`. However, this formula does not correctly account for all valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.

3. **No Handling of General Cases**: The code does not handle the general case where \(\gcd(a, b) \neq 1\). It only considers the case where \(\gcd(a, b) = 1\), which is insufficient.

### Conclusion
Given the issues mentioned above, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
