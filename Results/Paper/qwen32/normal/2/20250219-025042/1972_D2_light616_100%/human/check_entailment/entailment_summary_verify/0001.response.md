### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem requirements and the provided code to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Code Analysis:
The code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

#### Function `func_1`:
- Reads integers \(n\) and \(m\).
- Initializes a counter `cnt` to zero.
- Uses nested loops to iterate over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\).
- Outer loop runs while \(x \cdot x \leq n\).
- Inner loop runs while \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
- Checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
- If true, increments the counter by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) * y} \right\rfloor\).
- Prints the counter value.

#### Function `func_2`:
- Reads the number of test cases \(t\).
- Calls `func_1` for each test case.

#### Issues with the Code:
1. **Loop Conditions**: The loop conditions `while x * x <= n` and `while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m` are too restrictive. They do not cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\). For example, they miss pairs where \(x\) and \(y\) are not small relative to \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Incorrect Pair Counting**: The logic inside the loop assumes that if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), then the number of valid pairs can be counted using the formula `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`. This formula does not correctly account for all valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition. It only considers pairs where \(\gcd(a, b) = 1\), which is insufficient.

3. **No Handling of General Cases**: The code does not handle the general case where \(\gcd(a, b) \neq 1\). It only considers the case where \(\gcd(a, b) = 1\), which is insufficient.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given bounds and check if the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0\) holds. This approach ensures that all pairs are considered.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues mentioned above, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
