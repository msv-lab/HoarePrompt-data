To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop:

```
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is increased by 1.
- `y` is 2.
- `n` must be at least `(x + 1) * (x + 1)`.
- `m` must be at least `x + 1`.
- If `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, `cnt` is incremented by `min(n // ((x + 1) * x), m // (x + 1))`.

Let's analyze the conditions:

1. **Condition 1:** `(x + y) * x <= n`
   - Since `y` is 2, this condition becomes `(x + 2) * x <= n`.
   - Given that `n` must be at least `(x + 1) * (x + 1)`, we need to ensure that `(x + 2) * x <= n` holds true. This means `n` should be at least `(x + 2) * x`.

2. **Condition 2:** `(x + y) * y <= m`
   - Since `y` is 2, this condition becomes `(x + 2) * 2 <= m`.
   - Given that `m` must be at least `x + 1`, we need to ensure that `(x + 2) * 2 <= m` holds true. This means `m` should be at least `(x + 2) * 2`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `n` and `m` accordingly:

- `n` must be at least `(x + 2) * x`.
- `m` must be at least `(x + 2) * 2`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`x` is increased by 1, `y` is 2, `n` must be at least `(x + 2) * x`, `m` must be at least `(x + 2) * 2`**
