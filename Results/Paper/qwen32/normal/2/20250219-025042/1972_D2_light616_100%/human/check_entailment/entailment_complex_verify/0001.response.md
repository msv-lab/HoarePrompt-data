### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Code Analysis
The code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

#### Function `func_1`
- Reads a pair of integers \(n\) and \(m\).
- Initializes a counter `cnt` to zero.
- Uses nested loops to iterate over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\).
- The outer loop runs while \(x \cdot x \leq n\).
- The inner loop runs while \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
- Checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). If true, it increments the counter by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) * x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) * y} \right\rfloor\).
- Prints the counter value.

#### Function `func_2`
- Reads the number of test cases \(t\).
- Calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Issues with the Code

1. **Loop Conditions**:
   - The outer loop condition `while x * x <= n` restricts \(x\) to values up to \(\sqrt{n}\). This means that for larger values of \(a\), the loop does not consider them.
   - The inner loop condition `while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m` further restricts the values of \(y\). This means that for larger values of \(b\), the loop does not consider them.

2. **Pair Counting Logic**:
   - The logic inside the loop assumes that if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), then the number of valid pairs can be counted using the formula `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`. However, this formula does not correctly account for all valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.
   - The code does not handle the general case where \(\gcd(a, b) \neq 1\). It only considers the case where \(\gcd(a, b) = 1\), which is insufficient.

### Correctness Evaluation

Given the issues mentioned above, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The loop conditions and the counting logic are too restrictive and do not cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

### Final Evaluation

Based on the analysis, the original assessment is correct. The program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
