To determine the new state after executing the given code, let's analyze the changes:

The code modifies the variable `cnt` by adding the minimum of two expressions to it:
- `n // ((x + y) * x)`
- `m // ((x + y) * y)`

Given:
- `x` is increased by 1 from its previous state.
- `y` is 2.
- `n` must be at least `(x + 2) * x`.
- `m` must be at least `(x + 2) * 2`.

Let's denote the previous value of `x` as `x_prev`. After the increment, `x` becomes `x_prev + 1`.

The expressions become:
- `n // ((x_prev + 1 + 2) * (x_prev + 1))` which simplifies to `n // ((x_prev + 3) * (x_prev + 1))`
- `m // ((x_prev + 1 + 2) * 2)` which simplifies to `m // ((x_prev + 3) * 2)`

Since `n` must be at least `(x + 2) * x`, which is `(x_prev + 3) * (x_prev + 1)`, and `m` must be at least `(x + 2) * 2`, which is `(x_prev + 3) * 2`, the minimum of these divisions will be at least 1.

Thus, `cnt` will be incremented by at least 1.

Output State: **`x` is increased by 1, `y` is 2, `n` must be at least `(x + 2) * x`, `m` must be at least `(x + 2) * 2`, `cnt` is incremented by `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`**.
