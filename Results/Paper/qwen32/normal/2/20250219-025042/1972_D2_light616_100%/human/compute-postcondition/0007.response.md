To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the provided information and the behavior of the loop.

The loop is defined as follows:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()
```
This loop will execute `func_1()` exactly `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

From the given output states after the first few iterations:
- After 1 iteration, `t` must be at least 1.
- After 2 iterations, `t` must be exactly 2.
- After 3 iterations, `t` must be exactly 3.

Based on this pattern, it is clear that the loop will continue executing until it has completed `t` iterations. Since the output states indicate that `t` is exactly equal to the number of iterations completed, we can infer that `t` was initially set to a specific value and the loop executed exactly `t` times.

Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, the loop will have executed `t` times, and the value of `t` will remain unchanged unless modified within `func_1()`. However, since no changes to `t` are mentioned within the loop body, `t` will still represent the original number of test cases.

Thus, the final output state is simply that the loop has completed all `t` iterations, and `t` remains the same.

Output State: **t is the original number of test cases.**

In natural language: The output state after the loop has finished executing all iterations is that `t` remains the original number of test cases, and the loop has completed exactly `t` iterations.
