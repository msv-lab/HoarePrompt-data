To determine the new state after executing the given code, let's analyze the impact of the line `cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.

Given:
- `x` is increased by 1 from its previous state.
- `y` is 1.
- `n` must be at least `(x + 1) * (x + 1)`.
- `m` must be at least `x + 1`.
- `cnt` is incremented based on the GCD condition for each valid pair `(x, y)`.
- The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1.

Since `y` is 1, the expressions simplify as follows:
- `(x + y) * x` becomes `(x + 1) * x`.
- `(x + y) * y` becomes `(x + 1) * 1 = x + 1`.

Thus, the line of code becomes:
```python
cnt += min(n // ((x + 1) * x), m // (x + 1))
```

Let's denote the new value of `cnt` after the increment as `cnt_new`. The new state of `cnt` will be `cnt_new = cnt + min(n // ((x + 1) * x), m // (x + 1))`.

The conditions on `n` and `m` remain valid:
- `n` must still be at least `(x + 1) * (x + 1)`.
- `m` must still be at least `x + 1`.

The values of `x` and `y` remain as they are, with `x` having been increased by 1 from its previous state and `y` remaining 1.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`x` is increased by 1, `y` is 1, `n` must be at least `(x + 1) * (x + 1)`, `m` must be at least `x + 1`, and `cnt` is incremented by `min(n // ((x + 1) * x), m // (x + 1))`.**
