### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to ensure correctness.

#### Problem Understanding:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

#### Solution Analysis:
The solution consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).
   - Initializes a counter `cnt` to zero.
   - Iterates over possible values of `x` starting from 1 up to \(\sqrt{n}\).
   - For each `x`, iterates over possible values of `y` starting from 1.
   - Checks if \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
   - If `x` and `y` are coprime (\(\gcd(x, y) = 1\)), it increments the counter `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).
   - Prints the counter `cnt` after processing all pairs for the current test case.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - Calls `func_1` for each test case.

#### Verification Against Problem Requirements:
- The solution correctly handles multiple test cases.
- It iterates through potential values of `x` and `y` efficiently, considering only those pairs where \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
- It checks the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) implicitly by ensuring that `x` and `y` are coprime and calculating the count based on the constraints.
- The use of \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) simplifies the problem because if `x` and `y` are coprime, then \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = b\) needs to be a multiple of \(a + b\), which aligns with the logic of counting valid pairs.

#### Conclusion:
The provided solution appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It efficiently counts the valid pairs within the given constraints and handles multiple test cases.

### Correctness: **True**
