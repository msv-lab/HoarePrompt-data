You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, then executes `func_1` for each of these test cases. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value explicitly.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

### Code Analysis
The code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

#### Function `func_1`
- This function reads a pair of integers \(n\) and \(m\).
- It initializes a counter `cnt` to zero.
- It uses nested loops to iterate over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) where \(x\) and \(y\) represent potential values of \(a\) and \(b\).
- The outer loop runs while \(x \cdot x \leq n\).
- The inner loop runs while \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
- Inside the inner loop, it checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). If true, it increments the counter by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).
- Finally, it prints the counter value.

#### Function `func_2`
- This function reads the number of test cases \(t\).
- It calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Issues with the Code
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Loop Conditions**: The loop conditions do not cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\). Specifically, the condition `while x * x <= n` and `while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m` are too restrictive and do not consider all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Incorrect Pair Counting**: The logic inside the loop assumes that if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), then the number of valid pairs can be counted using the formula `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`. However, this formula does not correctly account for all valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.

3. **No Handling of General Cases**: The code does not handle the general case where \(\gcd(a, b) \neq 1\). It only considers the case where \(\gcd(a, b) = 1\), which is insufficient.

### Conclusion
Given the issues mentioned above, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
