It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the provided function definition and its parameters. The function `func_1()` does not accept any parameters according to the given code snippet. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it seems like the function should accept two parameters, `n` and `m`.

Let's assume the correct function definition should be:

```python
def func_1(n, m):
```

Given this assumption, here is the functionality description:

Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function returns a specific value or performs a specific operation based on these inputs, but the exact return value or operation is not specified in the provided information.**
