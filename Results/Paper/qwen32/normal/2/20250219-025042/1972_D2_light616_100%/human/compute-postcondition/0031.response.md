To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head:

The loop condition is:
```
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

From the given state:
- `x` is increased by 1.
- `n` must be at least `(x + 2) * x`.
- `y` is 3.
- `m` must be at least `(x + 2) * 2`.
- If `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, then `cnt` is increased by 1.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition 1**: `(x + y) * x <= n`
   - Given `y` is 3, this becomes `(x + 3) * x <= n`.
   - Since `n` must be at least `(x + 2) * x`, we need to ensure that `(x + 3) * x` is still less than or equal to `n`.

2. **Condition 2**: `(x + y) * y <= m`
   - Given `y` is 3, this becomes `(x + 3) * 3 <= m`.
   - Since `m` must be at least `(x + 2) * 2`, we need to ensure that `(x + 3) * 3` is still less than or equal to `m`.

### Adjustments:
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `n` and `m` such that both conditions are satisfied.
- Specifically, `n` should be at least `(x + 3) * x` and `m` should be at least `(x + 3) * 3`.

### Final State:
Given the above analysis, the state should be adjusted as follows:
- `x` is increased by 1 (as per the problem statement).
- `n` must be at least `(x + 3) * x`.
- `m` must be at least `(x + 3) * 3`.
- `y` remains 3.
- The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` leading to `cnt` being increased by 1 is not directly relevant to the loop continuation but is part of the state.

Therefore, the modified state is:
State: **`x` is increased by 1, `n` must be at least `(x + 3) * x`, `y` is 3, `m` must be at least `(x + 3) * 3`**
