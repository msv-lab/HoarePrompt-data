To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head, which is `x * x <= n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is increased by 1.
- `y` is the value that caused the loop to terminate.
- `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
- `cnt` is incremented based on the GCD condition for each valid pair `(x, y)`.

The loop will continue as long as `x * x <= n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that after `x` is incremented by 1, the condition `x * x <= n` still holds true.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current State**: After the previous iteration, `x` has been incremented by 1.
2. **Condition Check**: For the loop to execute again, the new value of `x` (let's call it `x_new`) must satisfy `x_new * x_new <= n`.
3. **Adjustment**: We need to ensure that `x_new * x_new <= n`. If `x_new * x_new > n`, then we need to adjust `n` to be greater than or equal to `x_new * x_new`.

### Conclusion:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `n`.
- We need to ensure that `n` is at least `x_new * x_new` where `x_new` is the current value of `x` after it has been incremented by 1.

Thus, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`x` is increased by 1, `y` is the value that caused the loop to terminate, `n` must be at least `x * x`, `m` remains unchanged, and `cnt` is incremented based on the GCD condition for each valid pair `(x, y)`**.

However, since `x` has already been incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, we should refer to the new value of `x` directly. Let's denote this new value as `x_new`.

So, the final adjusted state should be:
State: **`x` is increased by 1 (let's call this new value `x_new`), `y` is the value that caused the loop to terminate, `n` must be at least `x_new * x_new`, `m` remains unchanged, and `cnt` is incremented based on the GCD condition for each valid pair `(x, y)`**.

For simplicity in the context of the given format, we can say:
State: **`x` is increased by 1, `y` is the value that caused the loop to terminate, `n` must be at least `x * x`, `m` remains unchanged, and `cnt` is incremented based on the GCD condition for each valid pair `(x, y)`**.

But to be precise about the new value of `x`:
State: **`x` is increased by 1, `y` is the value that caused the loop to terminate, `n` must be at least `(x + 1) * (x + 1)`, `m` remains unchanged, and `cnt` is incremented based on the GCD condition for each valid pair `(x, y)`**.

Therefore, the final answer is:
State: **`x` is increased by 1, `y` is the value that caused the loop to terminate, `n` must be at least `(x + 1) * (x + 1)`, `m` remains unchanged, and `cnt` is incremented based on the GCD condition for each valid pair `(x, y)`**.
