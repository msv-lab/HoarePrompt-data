### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Recap
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Code Analysis

##### Function `func_1`
- **Initialization**: Initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
- **Outer Loop**: Runs while \(x \cdot x \leq n\).
- **Inner Loop**: Runs while \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) * y \leq m\).
- **Condition Check**: Checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). If true, it increments `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).
- **Output**: Prints the counter value `cnt`.

##### Function `func_2`
- Reads the number of test cases `t`.
- Calls `func_1` for each test case.

#### Annotations
- **State Before `func_1` Call**: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\).
- **State After `func_1` Execution**: `x` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`, `y` is the last value it took in the inner loop before termination, `cnt` is the total count of valid pairs `(x, y)` satisfying the conditions, and `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
- **State Before `func_2` Call**: `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment
1. **Loop Conditions**: The loop conditions `while x * x <= n` and `while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m` are indeed restrictive. They only consider certain pairs \((x, y)\) and do not cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\).
2. **Pair Counting Logic**: The logic inside the loop assumes that if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), then the number of valid pairs can be counted using the formula `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`. This formula does not correctly account for all valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.
3. **Handling of General Cases**: The code only considers the case where \(\gcd(a, b) = 1\), which is insufficient. It should handle cases where \(\gcd(a, b) \neq 1\) as well.

#### Correctness Evaluation
Given the issues identified:
- The loop conditions are too restrictive and do not cover all possible pairs.
- The counting logic is flawed and does not correctly account for all valid pairs.
- The code does not handle the general case where \(\gcd(a, b) \neq 1\).

Therefore, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
