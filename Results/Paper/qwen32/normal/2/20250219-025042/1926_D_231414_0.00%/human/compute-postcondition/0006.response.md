Output State: **`times` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `times` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `check` is 2147483647; `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `dic` is an empty dictionary; `ans` is `n`.**

In simple terms, the only change is that the variable `ans` has been assigned the value of `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
