Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `results` is either an empty list or contains one element 'no'; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is the value of the user input. The count of '1's in `arr` is even, and `arr` does not contain exactly two consecutive '1's ('11' is not a substring of `arr`).**
