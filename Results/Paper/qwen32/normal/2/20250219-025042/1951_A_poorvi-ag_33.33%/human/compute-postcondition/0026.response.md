Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is the integer value of the user input; `arr` is the value of the new user input. If `arr` contains an even number of '1's, `results` contains one additional element `'yes'` unless `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring, in which case `results` contains `'no'`. Otherwise, `results` contains one additional element `'no'`. `i` is incremented by 1.**
