The code snippet `results.append('no')` adds the string `'no'` to the list `results`. This means that regardless of the initial conditions regarding `arr` and its contents, the list `results` will now contain one more element `'no'`.

Other variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is the integer value of the user input; `arr` is the value of the new user input; `results` contains one additional element `'no'`; `i` is incremented by 1.**
