To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the given information about the loop and the initial state.

The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list and prints it. The number of iterations is determined by the length of the `results` list. Since the loop has already executed 3 times, we know that `results` contains at least 3 elements. After all iterations, the loop will have printed every element in the `results` list.

Therefore, the final output state will be when the loop has completed iterating through all elements in the `results` list. The `start` and `end` variables, as well as `t`, remain unchanged throughout the loop execution.

**Output State:** `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is an input integer; `results` is a list containing all its elements, and each element has been printed.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is an input integer; `results` is a list containing all its elements, and each element has been printed.**
