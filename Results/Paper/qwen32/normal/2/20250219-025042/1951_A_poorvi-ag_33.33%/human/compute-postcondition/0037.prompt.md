Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that start <= end; `t` is an input integer; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = input()
    if arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr:
        results.append('no')
    if arr.count('1') % 2 == 0:
        if arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr:
            results.append('no')
        else:
            results.append('yes')
    else:
        results.append('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is the value of the user input. If `arr` contains exactly two consecutive '1's ('11' is a substring of `arr`), `results` contains one or two elements 'no'. Otherwise, `results` is either an empty list, contains one element 'no', or contains ['no', 'yes'] or ['yes']. The count of '1's in `arr` is either even or odd, corresponding to the execution of the if or else part respectively.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is the integer value of the user input; `arr` is the value of the new user input. If `arr` contains an even number of '1's, `results` contains one additional element `'yes'` unless `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring, in which case `results` contains `'no'`. Otherwise, `results` contains one additional element `'no'`. `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `i + 1`, `t` remains the same, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring, `results` includes `'no'`. If `arr.count('1')` is even and does not meet the exact two '1's and '11' as a substring condition, `results` includes `'yes'`. Otherwise, `results` includes `'no'`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
