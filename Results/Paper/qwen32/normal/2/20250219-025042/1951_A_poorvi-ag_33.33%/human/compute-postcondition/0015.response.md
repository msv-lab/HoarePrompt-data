The code appends the string `'no'` to the `results` list. Given the initial state, `results` could either be an empty list or contain one element `'no'`. After appending `'no'`, `results` will definitely contain `'no'` as its last element. The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that start <= end; `t` is greater than 0; `results` contains one element 'no'; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is the value of the user input. If `arr` contains exactly two consecutive '1's ('11' is a substring of `arr`), then `results` contains one element 'no'. Otherwise, `results` contains one element 'no'. Additionally, the count of '1's in `arr` is odd.**
