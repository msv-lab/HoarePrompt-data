Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that start <= end; `t` must be greater than 0; `results` is an empty list; `n` is an input integer.**
This means that the variables `start`, `end`, and `t` retain their initial conditions, `results` remains an empty list, and `n` is now assigned the value of an integer input.
