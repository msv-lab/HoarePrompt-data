The given code snippet appends the string `'yes'` to the list `results`. This action does not affect the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, or `i`. The only change is that `results` now includes an additional element `'yes'`.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is the integer value of the user input; `arr` is the value of the new user input; `results` contains one additional element `'yes'`; `i` is incremented by 1.**
