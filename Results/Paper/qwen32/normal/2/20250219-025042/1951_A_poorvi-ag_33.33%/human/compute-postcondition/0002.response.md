In this task, the loop head involves the variable `i` and the input integer `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0 because `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 up to (but not including) `t`. The variables `start`, `end`, and `results` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be directly adjusted to influence whether the loop executes.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

- For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.
- The variable `i` is initialized automatically by the `range` function and does not need to be set beforehand.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `t`.

State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that start <= end; `t` must be greater than 0; `results` is an empty list.**
