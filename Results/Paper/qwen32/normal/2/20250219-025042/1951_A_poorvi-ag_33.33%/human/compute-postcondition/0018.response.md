The code snippet provided is:

```python
n = int(input())
```

This line of code takes an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `arr`, `results`, `i`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is the integer value of the user input; `arr` is the value of the user input; `results` is determined based on the conditions given; `i` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input, while all other variables retain their initial values.
