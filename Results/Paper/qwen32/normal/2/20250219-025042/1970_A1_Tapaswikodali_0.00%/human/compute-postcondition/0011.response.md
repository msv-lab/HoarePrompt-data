The code snippet `balance += 1` increments the value of the variable `balance` by 1. The initial state does not specify the initial value of `balance`, so we assume it could be any integer. The other variables (`s`, `i`, and `char`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `i` is 1; `char` is the second character of `s` and is either '(' or ')'; `balance` is increased by 1.**
