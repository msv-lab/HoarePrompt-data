### Reasoning:

The given Python program implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - The program starts by reading the input string `s`, which is a balanced parentheses sequence.
   - It initializes a variable `balance` to 0, which will keep track of the balance of the parentheses sequence as it iterates through the string.
   - It also initializes an empty list `details` to store tuples containing the balance, negative index, and character for each position in the string.

2. **Building the Details List**:
   - The program iterates over each character in the string `s` using `enumerate` to get both the index `i` and the character `char`.
   - If the character is `'('`, it increments the `balance` by 1.
   - If the character is `')'`, it decrements the `balance` by 1.
   - It appends a tuple `(balance, -i, char)` to the `details` list. The negative index `-i` is used to ensure that in cases where two characters have the same balance, they are sorted in decreasing order of their original positions (as required by the problem).

3. **Sorting the Details List**:
   - After building the `details` list, the program sorts it. The sorting is done primarily by the balance value (first element of the tuple), and secondarily by the negative index (second element of the tuple), which ensures that ties in balance are broken by the original position in descending order.

4. **Generating the Result**:
   - The program constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `details` list, ignoring the balance and index values.
   - Finally, it prints the resulting string, which is the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **Input**: `(()(()))`
- **Details List Construction**:
  - Prefix balance: `[0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`
  - Positions: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`
  - Characters: `['(', '(', ')', '(', '(', ')', ')', ')']`
  - Combined details: `[(0, -1, '('), (1, -2, '('), (2, -3, ')'), (1, -4, '('), (2, -5, '('), (3, -6, ')'), (2, -7, ')'), (1, -8, ')')]`
- **Sorted Details**:
  - Sorted by balance and then by negative position: `[(0, -1, '('), (1, -8, ')'), (1, -4, '('), (1, -2, '('), (2, -7, ')'), (2, -5, '('), (2, -3, ')'), (3, -6, ')')]`
- **Result String**:
  - Characters from sorted details: `'()(()())'`

The output matches the expected result, confirming that the program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above reasoning and verification, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
