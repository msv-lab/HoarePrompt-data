### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads a single line of input, which is expected to be a balanced parentheses sequence.
2. **Balance Calculation**: It iterates through the string `s` while maintaining a `balance` counter. This counter increases by 1 for every opening parenthesis `(` and decreases by 1 for every closing parenthesis `)`.
3. **Storing Details**: For each character in the string, it stores a tuple `(balance, -i, char)` in the list `details`. Here, `-i` is used to ensure that when sorting, ties in `balance` are broken by the position in descending order (since `-i` will be smaller for larger `i`).
4. **Sorting**: The list `details` is sorted primarily by `balance` in ascending order and secondarily by `-i` in descending order (which corresponds to the original position in descending order).
5. **Result Construction**: After sorting, the function constructs the resulting string by extracting the `char` from each tuple in the sorted list and joining them together.
6. **Output**: Finally, the constructed string is printed.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements:

- **Prefix Balance Calculation**: The prefix balance is correctly calculated and stored alongside the character and its negative index.
- **Sorting Logic**: The sorting logic ensures that the sequence is rearranged according to the rules specified in the problem statement.
- **Result Construction**: The final sequence is correctly constructed from the sorted list of tuples.

Since the program correctly implements the steps outlined in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately, it is correct.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
