### Reasoning:

The given Python program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads a balanced parentheses sequence from the standard input.
   
2. **Calculating Prefix Balances**: It iterates through the string, maintaining a running balance of the parentheses. For each opening parenthesis '(', it increments the balance, and for each closing parenthesis ')', it decrements the balance. At each step, it records the current balance, the negative index (to ensure descending order when sorting), and the character itself in a list called `details`.

3. **Sorting**: The list `details` is sorted primarily by the balance value in ascending order. If two characters have the same balance, they are sorted by their original position in descending order (achieved by using the negative index).

4. **Generating Output**: After sorting, the program constructs the output string by extracting the characters from the sorted list and joining them together.

5. **Printing Result**: Finally, it prints the resulting balanced shuffle sequence.

The logic aligns perfectly with the problem's requirements. By sorting based on the balance and position, the program ensures that the resulting sequence maintains the properties of a balanced parentheses sequence while being a shuffled version of the input.

### Conclusion:
Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as specified in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
