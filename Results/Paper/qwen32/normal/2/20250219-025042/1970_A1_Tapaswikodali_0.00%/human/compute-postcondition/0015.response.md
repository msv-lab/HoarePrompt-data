To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head: `i` and `char`.

Given:
- The state at the end of the previous iteration: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `i` is 1; `char` is the second character of `s` and is either '(' or ')'; `balance` is increased by 1 if `char` is '(', otherwise `balance` is decreased by 1; `details` includes the new tuple `(balance, -1, char)`.

The loop head is:
```python
for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
    # the loop body is omit
```

In each iteration, `enumerate(s)` provides the current index `i` and the corresponding character `char` from the string `s`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` was 1.
- `char` was the second character of `s`.

For the next iteration:
- `i` should be incremented by 1 because `enumerate` will provide the next index.
- `char` should be the character at the new index `i`.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be 2.
- `char` will be the third character of `s`.

The other variables (`s`, `balance`, `details`) are not part of the loop head and therefore should not be adjusted based on the loop head alone.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `i` is 2; `char` is the third character of `s`**.
