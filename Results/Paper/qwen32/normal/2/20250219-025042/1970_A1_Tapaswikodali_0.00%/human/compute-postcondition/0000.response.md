The code snippet `s = input()` reads a new input from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. Given the initial state, `s` was already a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and was a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000. After executing the code, `s` will be reassigned to whatever the new input string is, which must also satisfy the same conditions as the original `s` (non-empty, balanced parentheses sequence).

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.**
