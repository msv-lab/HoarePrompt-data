The `details.sort()` command sorts the list `details` in ascending order based on the elements of the tuples it contains. Each tuple in `details` is structured as `(balance, -i, char)`. 

Given that `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, the `balance` variable will start at 0 and will fluctuate as we iterate through the string `s`, increasing by 1 for each "(", and decreasing by 1 for each ")". The `-i` ensures that for tuples with the same `balance`, they are sorted in descending order of their original index `i` (since `-i` will be more negative for larger `i`).

After sorting, the list `details` will be ordered first by `balance` in ascending order, and for entries with the same `balance`, by the original index `i` in descending order.

Since `s`, `balance`, and the structure of `details` remain unchanged except for the order of elements within `details`, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `balance` is 0; `details` is a list containing tuples `(balance, -i, char)` for each character in `s`, sorted in ascending order by `balance` and in descending order by `i` for tuples with the same `balance`.**
