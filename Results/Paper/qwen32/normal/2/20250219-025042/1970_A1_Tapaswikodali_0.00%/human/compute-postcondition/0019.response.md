The code appends a tuple to the list `details`. The tuple contains three elements: the current value of `balance`, `-i`, and the value of `char`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence.
- `i` is 2.
- `char` is the third character of `s`.
- If `char` is '(', then `balance` is increased by 1; otherwise, `balance` is decreased by 1.

Since `i` is 2, `-i` will be -2. The value of `balance` depends on whether `char` is '(' or ')'.

Let's consider both cases:
1. If `char` is '(', then `balance` is increased by 1.
2. If `char` is ')', then `balance` is decreased by 1.

Therefore, the tuple appended to `details` will be `(balance, -2, char)`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `i` is 2; `char` is the third character of `s`; if `char` is '(', then `balance` is increased by 1; otherwise, `balance` is decreased by 1; `details` now includes the tuple `(balance, -2, char)`.**
