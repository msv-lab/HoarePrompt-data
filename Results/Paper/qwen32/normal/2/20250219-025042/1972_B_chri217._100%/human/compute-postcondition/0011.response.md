The code snippet provided reads a new positive integer `n` from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means the previous value of `n` is overwritten by the newly read value. The other variables (`t`, `s`, and `cases`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer read from input (1 <= t <= 100); `n` is a new positive integer read from input (1 <= n <= 100); `s` is a new string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D" as read from the input; `cases` is a list containing two tuples, the first being the original tuple and the second being `(n, s)`**.
