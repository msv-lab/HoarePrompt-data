The code snippet provided reads a new line from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns the result to the variable `s`. This means the original value of `s` is overwritten.

Given the initial state, `s` was a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". After executing the code, `s` is reassigned to a new string read from the input, which also contains only "U" and "D", and its length is the new `n` read from the input.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `cases`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer read from input (1 <= t <= 100) minus 1, `n` is a new positive integer read from input (1 <= n <= 100), `s` is a new string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D" as read from the input, `cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, s)`**.
