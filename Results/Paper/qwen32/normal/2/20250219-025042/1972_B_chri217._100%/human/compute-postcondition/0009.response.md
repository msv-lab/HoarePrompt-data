The code appends a new tuple `(n, s)` to the list `cases`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged except for the list `cases` which now includes the additional tuple.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer read from input (1 <= t <= 100) minus 1, `n` is a new positive integer read from input (1 <= n <= 100), `s` is a new string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D" as read from the input, `cases` is a list containing two tuples, the first being the original tuple and the second being `(n, s)`**.
