### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the initial configuration of coins. The key insight here is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins ('U') determines the winner when both players play optimally.

- **Odd Number of 'U's**: Alice wins because she can always force Bob into a position where he faces an even number of 'U's, eventually leading to Bob's loss.
- **Even Number of 'U's**: Bob wins because Alice will always face an even number of 'U's after her turn, and he can mirror her strategy to ensure he is the one to make the last move.

The provided program reads multiple test cases, counts the number of 'U's in the string for each case, and determines the winner based on whether this count is odd or even. This aligns perfectly with the optimal strategy described above.

### Correctness:

Given the analysis above, the program correctly implements the logic required to determine the winner based on the initial configuration of the coins. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
