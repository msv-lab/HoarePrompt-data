You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program:
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
        cases.append((n, s))
    return cases

#Function 2:
def func_2(case):
    ups = sum((1 for c in case[1] if c == 'U'))
    return 'YES' if ups % 2 else 'NO'



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function takes a tuple `case` as input, where the first element is an integer `n` representing the number of coins, and the second element is a string of length `n` consisting of "U" and "D". It returns 'YES' if the number of "U" characters in the string is odd, and 'NO' otherwise.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

### Problem Analysis

The game involves a circular arrangement of coins, each of which can be either facing up ('U') or facing down ('D'). Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins. The player who cannot make a move loses. The goal is to determine if Alice (who goes first) will win if both players play optimally.

### Key Points

1. **Game Dynamics**: 
   - A player can only remove a facing-up coin ('U').
   - When a facing-up coin is removed, its adjacent coins are flipped.
   - The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins left.

2. **Winning Strategy**:
   - The outcome depends on the number of facing-up coins.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always win because she can always make the last move.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will always win because Alice will eventually leave Bob with an odd number of facing-up coins, allowing Bob to make the last move.

### Program Analysis

The provided program consists of two functions:

- `func_1()`: Reads the input and returns a list of test cases.
- `func_2(case)`: Determines the winner based on the number of facing-up coins in a given test case.

#### Function `func_1()`

This function reads the input from standard input and processes it into a list of test cases. Each test case is represented as a tuple containing the number of coins (`n`) and the string representing the coins (`s`).

#### Function `func_2(case)`

This function calculates the number of facing-up coins (`ups`) in the string `s`. It then determines the winner based on whether the number of facing-up coins is odd or even:
- If `ups % 2` is true (i.e., the number of facing-up coins is odd), it returns 'YES', indicating Alice wins.
- Otherwise, it returns 'NO', indicating Bob wins.

### Verification

The core logic of the program is to count the number of 'U' characters in the string and determine the winner based on the parity of this count. This aligns perfectly with the winning strategy derived from the problem analysis.

### Edge Cases

Let's consider some edge cases to ensure the program handles all scenarios correctly:

1. **Single Coin**:
   - Input: `1\nU`
   - Expected Output: `YES` (Alice wins because she can remove the only coin).
   - Actual Output: `YES` (Correct)

2. **All Coins Facing Down**:
   - Input: `3\nDDD`
   - Expected Output: `NO` (Alice cannot make a move).
   - Actual Output: `NO` (Correct)

3. **Even Number of Facing-Up Coins**:
   - Input: `4\nUUDD`
   - Expected Output: `NO` (Bob wins because the number of facing-up coins is even).
   - Actual Output: `NO` (Correct)

4. **Odd Number of Facing-Up Coins**:
   - Input: `5\nUUDUD`
   - Expected Output: `YES` (Alice wins because the number of facing-up coins is odd).
   - Actual Output: `YES` (Correct)

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and verifying it against various test cases, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It accurately determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly counts the number of facing-up coins and determines the winner based on whether this count is odd or even, which aligns with the optimal strategy derived from the problem description. The program handles all edge cases appropriately.
