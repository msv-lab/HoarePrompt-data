You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a tuple `case` as input, where the first element is an integer `n` representing the number of coins, and the second element is a string of length `n` consisting of "U" and "D". It returns 'YES' if the number of "U" characters in the string is odd, and 'NO' otherwise.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the winner of the game based on the initial configuration of the coins. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics**:
   - Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins.
   - The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins left.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The critical observation here is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins (`U`) determines the winner.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always win because she can always force Bob into a position where the number of facing-up coins is even, and eventually, Bob will face a situation with no facing-up coins left.
   - Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that he is never the one to face a situation with no facing-up coins left.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it counts the number of 'U' characters in the string.
   - It then checks if this count is odd or even.
   - If the count is odd, it outputs "YES" (indicating Alice wins).
   - If the count is even, it outputs "NO" (indicating Bob wins).

4. **Verification with Example**:
   - For the input `UUDUD`, the number of 'U' is 3 (odd), so the output should be "YES".
   - For the input `UDDUD`, the number of 'U' is 2 (even), so the output should be "NO".
   - For the input `UU`, the number of 'U' is 2 (even), so the output should be "NO".

The provided program correctly implements this logic by counting the 'U' characters and checking their parity.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines the winner based on the number of facing-up coins. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
