### Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the winner of the game based on the initial configuration of the coins. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics**:
   - Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins.
   - The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins left.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The critical observation here is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins (`U`) determines the winner.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always win because she can always force Bob into a position where the number of facing-up coins is even, and eventually, Bob will face a situation with no facing-up coins left.
   - Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that he is never the one to face a situation with no facing-up coins left.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it counts the number of 'U' characters in the string.
   - It then checks if this count is odd or even.
   - If the count is odd, it outputs "YES" (indicating Alice wins).
   - If the count is even, it outputs "NO" (indicating Bob wins).

4. **Verification with Example**:
   - For the input `UUDUD`, the number of 'U' is 3 (odd), so the output should be "YES".
   - For the input `UDDUD`, the number of 'U' is 2 (even), so the output should be "NO".
   - For the input `UU`, the number of 'U' is 2 (even), so the output should be "NO".

The provided program correctly implements this logic by counting the 'U' characters and checking their parity.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines the winner based on the number of facing-up coins. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
