Given the initial state, we have several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1`) with specific conditions and descriptions. However, the `print` statement in the provided code snippet is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output does not depend on the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, or `cnt1`.

Output: **YES**
