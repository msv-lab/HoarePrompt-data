Reasoning:  
The provided problem description and the given program do not match. The problem description describes a function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` that scans through directories within the current working directory, checks if their names fall within a specified numeric range, and generates two files (`-ac.py` and `-wa.py`) for each `.html` file found in those directories. 

However, the given program does not implement this functionality at all. Instead, it defines a function `func_1` that reads input values, counts the occurrences of the character '1' in a string, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions related to the count of '1's and the presence of the substring '11'. This program is completely unrelated to the problem description provided.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect for the problem described.

Correctness: **False**
