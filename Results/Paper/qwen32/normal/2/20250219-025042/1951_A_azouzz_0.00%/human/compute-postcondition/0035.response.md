Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is a new input integer.
- `s` is a new string provided by user input.
- `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new string `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`. There are no variables or expressions involved in this print statement that depend on the initial state or any calculations. The string `'NO'` is explicitly provided.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'NO'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
