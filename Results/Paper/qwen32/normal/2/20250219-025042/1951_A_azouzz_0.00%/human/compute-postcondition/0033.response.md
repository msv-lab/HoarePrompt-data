The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `cnt1`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their specific values do not affect the output.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
2. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided within the `print` function.
3. No variables or conditions are evaluated or used in this `print` statement.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement will simply be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
