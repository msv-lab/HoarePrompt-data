Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a string provided by user input and contains the substring '11'; `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`, which is at least 2. Additionally, either `cnt1` is even, or `cnt1` is exactly 2.**
