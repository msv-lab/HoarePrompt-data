Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a string provided by user input; `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`. If `s` contains the substring '11', then `cnt1` is at least 2 and either `cnt1` is even or `cnt1` is exactly 2. Otherwise, `cnt1` is less than or equal to 2, or `cnt1` is even, or `cnt1` is exactly 1, and the substring '11' is not in `s`.**
