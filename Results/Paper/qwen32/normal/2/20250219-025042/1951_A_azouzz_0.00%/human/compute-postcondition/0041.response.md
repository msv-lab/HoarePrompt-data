It appears there is a mistake in the provided example since the function `func_1()` does not accept any parameters according to the given definition. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, I will assume the function should accept `start` and `end` as parameters.

Revised Parameter constraints: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`.
```
def func_1(start, end):
```

Now, let's determine the functionality based on the provided output structure:

Output: 
- Case_1: If `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, the function returns a list of integers from `start` to `end` inclusive.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `start` and `end`, which are integers such that `start <= end`. The function returns a list of integers from `start` to `end` inclusive.**
