The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `cnt1`) mentioned in the initial state. It directly prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
