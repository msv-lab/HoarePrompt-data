Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`.
- `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is the new string provided by user input.
- `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new string `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet simply outputs the string `'NO'`. This output does not depend on any of the variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `cnt1`) mentioned in the initial state. The print statement is static and does not perform any operations or calculations involving these variables.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is the string `'NO'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
