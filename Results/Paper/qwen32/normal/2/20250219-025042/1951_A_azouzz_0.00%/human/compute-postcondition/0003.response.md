`s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which means `s` will hold the string value provided by the user input. The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a string provided by user input.**
