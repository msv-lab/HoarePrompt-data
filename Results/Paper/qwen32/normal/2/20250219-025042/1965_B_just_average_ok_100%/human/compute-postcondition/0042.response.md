To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

- `nums` is initially a predefined list of powers of 2.
- `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if `k` is less than 1.
- The line `nums.append(k - nums[idx])` appends a new element to the `nums` list.

Here's what happens:
- The new element being appended is `k - nums[idx]`.
- This means the `nums` list will now have one additional element at the end, which is the difference between `k` and the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`.

Since `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, and only `nums` is modified, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, `k - nums[idx]`]; `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if `k` is less than 1.**
