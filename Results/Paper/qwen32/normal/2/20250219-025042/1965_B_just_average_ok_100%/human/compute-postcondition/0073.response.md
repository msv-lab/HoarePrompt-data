Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. It processes `t` test cases, and for each test case, it returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k`. Specifically, if `k` is less than `n`, it returns the value of `n - k + 1`; otherwise, it returns `1`.**
