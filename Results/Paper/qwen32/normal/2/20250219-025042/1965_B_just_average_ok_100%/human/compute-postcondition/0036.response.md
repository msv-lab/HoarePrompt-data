Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]. If `nums[i] > k`, then `idx` is set to 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `idx` remains -1 and `i` remains 1.**
