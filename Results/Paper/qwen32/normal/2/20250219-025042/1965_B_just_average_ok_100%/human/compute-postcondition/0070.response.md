To determine the output of the `print(len(nums))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the `nums` list:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
   - `idx` is the index of the largest element in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or 20 if `k` is greater than 1048576.
   - `nums` is constructed as follows:
     - Start with the list `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`.
     - Add `k - nums[idx]` to the list.
     - Add `k + 1` to the list.
     - Add `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the list.
     - Remove `2^idx` from the list.

2. **Determine the Length of `nums`:**
   - The initial list contains 21 elements: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`.
   - Three additional elements are added: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - One element is removed: `2^idx`.

Therefore, the net change in the number of elements in the list is:
- Initial elements: 21
- Added elements: 3
- Removed elements: 1

So, the total number of elements in `nums` is \(21 + 3 - 1 = 23\).

Thus, the length of `nums` is 23.

Output: **23**
