Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `i` is `i + 1`, `idx` is `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, `i`, and `idx` remain unchanged. The only effect of the `break` statement is that it exits the most internal loop or if statement.
