Let's break down the problem step by step based on the initial state provided:

1. **Variables and Lists**:
   - `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (This variable does not affect the calculation of `nums` or its length).
   - `n` and `k`: Integers read from the input.
   - `nums`: A predefined list containing powers of 2 up to 2^20, along with `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, but with the element `1 << idx` (which is equivalent to `2^idx`) removed.
   - `idx`: The index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if `k` is less than 1.

2. **Construction of `nums`**:
   - The list `nums` initially contains the following elements: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`.
   - Additionally, it includes `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - The element `1 << idx` (which is `2^idx`) is removed from the list.

3. **Determine `idx`**:
   - `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - If `k` is less than 1, `idx` is -1, but this case is not relevant here since `k` is part of the list construction.

4. **Calculate Length of `nums`**:
   - Initially, `nums` has 21 elements (powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20).
   - Three additional elements are added: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - One element (`1 << idx`) is removed.
   - Therefore, the total number of elements in `nums` is `21 + 3 - 1 = 23`.

Given the above reasoning, the length of `nums` will always be 23 regardless of the specific values of `n` and `k` (as long as `k` is within a reasonable range where `idx` can be determined).

Thus, the `print(len(nums))` statement will output `23`.

Output: **23**
