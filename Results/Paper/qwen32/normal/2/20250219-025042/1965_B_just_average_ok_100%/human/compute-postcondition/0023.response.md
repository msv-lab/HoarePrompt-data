To determine the output of the `print(*nums)` statement, let's break down the initial state and how the `nums` list is constructed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
   - `nums` is a list containing specific elements derived from powers of 2 and the value of `k`.

2. **Construction of `nums`:**
   - The list `nums` initially contains the powers of 2 up to 2^20 (which is 1048576).
   - Additionally, it includes `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, where `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`. If `k` is greater than 1048576, `idx` is -1, and these additional elements are not included.
   - The element `1 << idx` (which is the same as `nums[idx]`) is removed from the list.

Let's analyze the construction step-by-step:

- **Step 1:** Create a list of powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20.
- **Step 2:** Determine `idx` as the index of the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.
- **Step 3:** Remove `nums[idx]` from the list.
- **Step 4:** If `k` is within the range of the powers of 2 in the list (i.e., `k` ≤ 1048576), add `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the list.

Given this, the final `nums` list will contain all the powers of 2 from 1 to 1048576 except the one closest to and less than or equal to `k`, along with three additional elements derived from `k` if `k` is within the range.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `k = 100`.

- The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 100 is 64, so `idx = 6` (since 2^6 = 64).
- Remove 64 from the list.
- Add `k - nums[idx] = 100 - 64 = 36`, `k + 1 = 101`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1 = 100 + 64 + 1 = 165` to the list.

Thus, the `nums` list would be:
\[ [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 36, 101, 165] \]

### General Output:
The `nums` list will always contain the powers of 2 from 1 to 1048576 except the one closest to and less than or equal to `k`, along with three additional elements derived from `k` if `k` is within the range.

Therefore, the output will be a list of these values.

Output: **[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, k - nums[idx], k + 1, k + nums[idx] + 1] (excluding nums[idx] and only including k-related elements if k ≤ 1048576)**
