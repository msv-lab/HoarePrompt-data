Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list containing at least two elements, `t` is a list containing the element `ai` if `op` is 0, otherwise `t` now contains `ai` as its last element, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`, `op` is `op ^ ((val >> i) & 1)`, `ai` is the result of `ai ^ val`, `cnt` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged, `val` is the next element in `a`.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that the list `t` now includes `ai` as its last element due to the `t.append(ai)` operation. All other variables retain their initial values or expressions as described in the initial state.
