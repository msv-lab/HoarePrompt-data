To determine the new state after executing the given Python code, let's analyze the impact of the line `op ^= val >> i & 1`.

Given:
- `op` is initially 0.
- `val >> i & 1` computes the i-th bit of `val`.

The operation `op ^= val >> i & 1` means:
- Compute the i-th bit of `val`.
- Perform a bitwise XOR operation between `op` (which is 0) and the i-th bit of `val`.
- Assign the result back to `op`.

Since `op` is initially 0, the result of `op ^= val >> i & 1` will simply be the i-th bit of `val`.

Therefore, the new value of `op` will be either 0 or 1, depending on whether the i-th bit of `val` is 0 or 1.

Other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, `u`, `v`, `ai`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the return value of `func_1()` and must contain at least one element, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and equals 0, `v` is an even number or 0, `op` is the i-th bit of `val`, `ai` is 0**.
