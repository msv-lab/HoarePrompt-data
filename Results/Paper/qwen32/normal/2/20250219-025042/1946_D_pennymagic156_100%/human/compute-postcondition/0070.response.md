The code snippet appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`. None of the other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `u`, `v`, `op`) are modified by this operation.

Given that `t` was initially an empty list, after appending `ai`, `t` now contains one element, which is `ai`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list containing at least one element, `t` is a list containing one element `ai`, `u` is `(x >> 27) & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a])`, `op` is `0`, `ai` is `val`.**
