The code snippet swaps the values of `a` and `t`. Initially, `a` is the return value of `func_1()` and `t` is a list containing accumulated `ai` values whenever `op` became 0. After the swap, `a` will hold the list `t`, and `t` will be an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list containing accumulated `ai` values whenever `op` became 0, `t` is [], `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and equals 0, `v` is an even number or 0, `op` is the XOR of the i-th bits of all elements in `a`, `ai` is the XOR of all elements in `a` if `op` never became 0; otherwise, it is the XOR of the elements since the last time `op` was 0.**
