Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list containing at least one element, `u` is `(x >> 27) & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a])`, `op` is `a[ai] >> ai & 1`, `ai` is `val`. If `op` is `0`, then `t` is a list containing one element `ai`. Otherwise, `t` remains an empty list.**
