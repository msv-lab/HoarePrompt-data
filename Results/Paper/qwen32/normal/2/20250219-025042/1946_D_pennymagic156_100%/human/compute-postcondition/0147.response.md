To determine the new state after executing the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the impact of the operation `op ^= val >> i & 1`.

The operation `val >> i & 1` performs a bitwise right shift on `val` by `i` positions and then performs a bitwise AND with `1`. This effectively extracts the `i-th` bit of `val`. The result of this operation is then XORed with the current value of `op`.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `op` is initially 0.
- `val >> i & 1` extracts a specific bit from `val`.

Since `op` is initially 0, the result of `op ^= val >> i & 1` will simply be the value of `val >> i & 1`. Therefore, `op` will be updated to the `i-th` bit of `val`.

The other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `cnt`, `ai`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Thus, the updated state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a non-empty list containing accumulated `ai` values, `t` is an empty list, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is the `i-th` bit of `val`, `cnt` is 0, `ai` is the XOR of all elements in `a` since the last time `op` was 0.**
