The given code snippet performs a bitwise XOR operation between the current value of `op` and the result of `(val >> i) & 1`. This operation updates the value of `op`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer (unchanged).
- `x` is a non-negative integer (unchanged).
- `a` is the return value of `func_1()` and must be an iterable with at least two elements (unchanged).
- `t` is an empty list (unchanged).
- `ans` is -1 (unchanged).
- `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and is not equal to 0 (unchanged).
- `v` is even and non-zero (unchanged).
- `op` is `(val >> i) & 1` (this will change).
- `cnt` is 1 if `op` is 0, otherwise `cnt` remains 0 (this may change based on the new `op`).
- `val` is the next element in `a` (unchanged).

The line `op ^= val >> i & 1` modifies `op` by performing a bitwise XOR with `(val >> i) & 1`.

Let's denote the original value of `op` as `op_original` and the new value of `op` as `op_new`. The new value of `op` (`op_new`) is calculated as:
\[ \text{op\_new} = \text{op\_original} \oplus (\text{val} >> i) \& 1 \]

Since `cnt` depends on the value of `op`, if `op_new` becomes 0, `cnt` will be set to 1; otherwise, `cnt` will remain 0.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the return value of `func_1()` and must be an iterable with at least two elements, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and is not equal to 0, `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is `op_original ^ ((val >> i) & 1)`, `cnt` is 1 if `op` is 0, otherwise `cnt` remains 0, `val` is the next element in `a`.**
