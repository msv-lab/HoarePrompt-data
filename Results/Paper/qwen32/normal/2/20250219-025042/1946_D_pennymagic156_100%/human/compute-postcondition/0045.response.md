The only object in the loop head is the variable `val`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the iterable `a`. If `a` has more elements, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` is an iterable with at least one element, and `val` was the last element processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least one more element.

Let's assume that `a` has at least two elements. After processing the first element (`val`), the next element in `a` should be assigned to `val`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the return value of `func_1()` and must be an iterable with at least two elements, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and is not equal to 0, `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is `(val >> i) & 1`, `cnt` is 1 if `op` is 0, otherwise `cnt` remains 0, `val` is the next element in `a`**
