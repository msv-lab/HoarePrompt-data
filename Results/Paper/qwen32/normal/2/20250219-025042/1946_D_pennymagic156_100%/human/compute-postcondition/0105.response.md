Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list containing at least two elements, `t` is an empty list, `u` is `(x >> 27) & 1` and `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is `sum([(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a])`, `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is `(op ^ (val >> i & 1))`, `val` is the next element in the list `a` after the previously processed element, `val_next` is the same as `val` from the previous iteration, `ai` is the XOR of all elements in `a` if `op` never became 0; otherwise, it is the XOR of the elements since the last time `op` was 0. If `op` is 0, `cnt` is incremented by 1.**
