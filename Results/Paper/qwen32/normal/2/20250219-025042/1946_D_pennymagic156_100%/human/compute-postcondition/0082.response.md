The given code appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`. The initial state of `t` depends on the value of `op` before the operation. If `op` was `0`, `t` initially contains `[a[j+1], ai]`; otherwise, `t` is an empty list.

After appending `ai` to `t`, the new state of `t` will be:
- If `op` was `0` before the operation, `t` will now contain `[a[j+1], ai, ai]`.
- If `op` was not `0` before the operation, `t` will now contain `[ai]`.

The values of other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `u`, `v`, `val`, `ai`, `op`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list containing at least one element, `u` is `(x >> 27) & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a])`, `val` is `a[j+2]`, `ai` is `ai ^ val`, `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `t` is `[a[j+1], ai, ai]` if `op` was `0` before the operation, otherwise `t` is `[ai]`**.
