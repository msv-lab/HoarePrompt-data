The code snippet provided is `ai ^= val`. This operation performs a bitwise XOR between the current value of `ai` and `val`, and assigns the result back to `ai`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `x` is a non-negative integer.
- `a` is the return value of `func_1()` and must contain at least one element.
- `t` is an empty list.
- `ans` is -1.
- `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and equals 0.
- `v` is an even number or 0.
- `op` is the i-th bit of `val`.
- `ai` is 0.

After executing `ai ^= val`, the value of `ai` changes from 0 to `val` because any number XORed with 0 remains unchanged. Therefore, `ai` now holds the value of `val`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the return value of `func_1()` and must contain at least one element, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and equals 0, `v` is an even number or 0, `op` is the i-th bit of `val`, `ai` is `val`.**
