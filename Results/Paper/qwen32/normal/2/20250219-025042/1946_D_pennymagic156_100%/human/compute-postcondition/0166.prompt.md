Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the return value of `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(29, -1, -1):
    u, v = x >> i & 1, sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])
    if u == v == 0:
        continue
    if u == 0:
        if v % 2:
            return ans
        else:
            op = ai = 0
            for val in a:
                op ^= val >> i & 1
                ai ^= val
                if not op:
                    t.append(ai)
                    ai = 0
            a, t = t, []
    elif v % 2:
        continue
    elif v:
        op = cnt = 0
        for val in a:
            op ^= val >> i & 1
            if not op:
                cnt += 1
        ans = max(ans, cnt)
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is either the return value of `func_1()` or a list containing accumulated `ai` values whenever `op` became 0, `t` is an empty list, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1`. If `u` equals 0, then `v` is an even number or 0, `op` is the XOR of the i-th bits of all elements in `a`, and `ai` is the XOR of all elements in `a` if `op` never became 0; otherwise, it is the XOR of the elements since the last time `op` was 0. If `u` does not equal 0, then if `v` is odd, the state remains unchanged from the precondition. If `v` is even, `ans` is `max(-1, cnt)` where `cnt` is the number of times `op` was zero during the iterations, unless `v` is zero, in which case `ans` remains -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is either the return value of `func_1()` or a list containing accumulated `ai` values whenever `op` became 0, `t` is an empty list, `u` is `(x >> 27) & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a])`, `op` is the XOR of the 27-th bits of all elements in `a`, `ai` is the XOR of all elements in `a` if `op` never became 0; otherwise, it is the XOR of the elements since the last time `op` was 0. If `u == 0`, `ai` is set to 0. If `u != 0` and `v` is odd, the state remains as described above. If `u != 0` and `v` is even and non-zero, `cnt` is the number of times `op` became 0 during the loop execution, and `ans` is the maximum value between its previous value and `cnt`. If `v` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1`. If `u == 0`, then `a` becomes an empty list, `t` accumulates the `ai` values where `op` became 0, and `ai` is set to 0. If `u != 0`, `a` retains its original value or is the return value of `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, and `ai` is the XOR of elements in `a` since the last time `op` became 0 or 0 if `op` became 0 in the last iteration. If `v` (which is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`) is odd, the state remains as described above. If `v` is even and non-zero, `cnt` is the number of times `op` became 0 during the loop execution, and `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `cnt`. If `v` is even and zero, the loop breaks or the if statement is exited, and `i` is set to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
