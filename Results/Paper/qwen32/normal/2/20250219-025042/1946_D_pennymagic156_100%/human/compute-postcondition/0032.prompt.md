Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the return value of `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and equals 0, `v` is an even number or 0, `op` is 0, `ai` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for val in a:
    op ^= val >> i & 1
    ai ^= val
    if not op:
        t.append(ai)
        ai = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the return value of `func_1()` and contains at least one element, `t` is either an empty list or a list containing `ai`, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and equals 0, `v` is an even number or 0, `op` is the i-th bit of `val`. If `op` is 0, then `t` contains `ai` and `ai` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the return value of `func_1()` and contains at least two elements, `t` is either an empty list or a list containing the updated `ai` (which is now `ai ^ val`), `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and equals 0, `v` is an even number or 0, `op` is 1. Since `op` is 1, the `if not op` condition is false, so none of the changes described in the if part are applied.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the return value of `func_1()` and contains at least two elements, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and equals 0, `v` is an even number or 0, `op` is `1 ^ (a[1] >> i & 1)`. If `op` is 0, then `t` is a list containing the updated `ai` (which is now `ai ^ val`) and `ai`, and `ai` is 0. Otherwise, `t` remains either an empty list or a list containing the updated `ai` (which is now `ai ^ val`).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
