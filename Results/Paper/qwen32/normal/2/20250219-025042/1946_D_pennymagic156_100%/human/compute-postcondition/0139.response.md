The code snippet swaps the contents of `a` and `t`, and then resets `t` to an empty list. Given the initial state, `a` contains accumulated `ai` values whenever `op` became 0, and `t` also contains these accumulated `ai` values. After the swap, `a` will contain what was previously in `t` (which is an empty list), and `t` will contain what was previously in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is [], `t` is a list containing accumulated `ai` values where `op` became 0, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`, `op` is the result of XORing all bits at position `i` of each element in `a`, `ai` is the XOR of all elements in `a` since the last time `op` became 0 or 0 if `op` became 0 in the last iteration, `cnt` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged.**
