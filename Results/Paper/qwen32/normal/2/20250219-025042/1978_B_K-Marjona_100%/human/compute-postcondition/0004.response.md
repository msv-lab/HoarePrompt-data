Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `b` is less than or equal to `a`.
- `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. Since `b <= a`, the value of `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `0`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a * n)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `a` is an integer read from the input.
- The variable `n` is also an integer read from the input.
- The expression `a * n` simply multiplies these two integers.

### Output:
The code prints the result of multiplying `a` and `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **a * n (where a is an integer read from the input and n is an integer read from the input)**
