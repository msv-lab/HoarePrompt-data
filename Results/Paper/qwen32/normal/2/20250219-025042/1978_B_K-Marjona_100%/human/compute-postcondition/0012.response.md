To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the calculations involved:

### Initial State:
- `t` is `t-1`: This suggests that `t` is being decremented by 1, but it does not directly affect the print statement.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `k` is calculated as the minimum value between `n` and `b - a` (or `n` and `0` if `b` is less than or equal to `a`).

### Calculation of `k`:
- If `b > a`, then `k = min(n, b - a)`.
- If `b <= a`, then `k = min(n, 0)`, which simplifies to `k = 0`.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
```

Let's break down the expression inside the print statement:

1. **`b * k`**: This term multiplies `b` by `k`.
2. **`k * (k - 1) // 2`**: This term calculates the sum of the first `k-1` integers. It represents the sum of an arithmetic series from 0 to `k-1`.
3. **`(n - k) * a`**: This term multiplies the difference between `n` and `k` by `a`.

### Combining the Terms:
The expression `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a` combines these three terms to produce the final result.

### Final Output Description:
Given the conditions and calculations above, the output will be the result of the expression `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.

### Output:
Output: **b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a (where k is min(n, b - a) if b > a else 0)**
