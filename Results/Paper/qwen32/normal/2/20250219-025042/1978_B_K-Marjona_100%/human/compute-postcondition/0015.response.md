The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. This means that the initial state of `n`, `a`, and `b` as integers read from the input is overwritten by the new values read from the input.

The variable `t` remains unchanged as `t-1` since it is not affected by the code snippet provided. The variable `k` is also not recalculated or reassigned in the given code snippet, so its value remains as the minimum value between `n` and `b - a` (or `n` and `0` if `b` was less than or equal to `a`) based on the initial state.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are new integers read from the input; `k` is the minimum value between the new `n` and the new `b - a` (or the new `n` and `0` if the new `b` is less than or equal to the new `a`).**
