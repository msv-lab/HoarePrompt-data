Output State: **t is 0, and no more inputs are processed.**

In natural language, after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be 0 because it gets decremented with each iteration until it reaches 0. At this point, no more inputs are processed, and the loop terminates. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` from the last iteration are no longer relevant as they are overwritten in each iteration.
