Postcondition: **`l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is the first element of `l` if `l[x]` is not less than `a`; otherwise, `a` is set to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`. `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its predecessor (or 0 if no such element exists), unless `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `b` is updated to `l[x]`. `c` is 0, `y` is 0, and `n` is the length of the list `l`. Additionally, if `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is set to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`; otherwise, `b` is set to `l[x]`. If `a < l[x]`, then `l[x]` is not less than `b`.**
