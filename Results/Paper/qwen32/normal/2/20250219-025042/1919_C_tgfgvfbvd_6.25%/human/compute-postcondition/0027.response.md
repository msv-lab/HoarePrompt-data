Postcondition: **`y` is such that `y + 1 < n`, `n` is greater than `y + 1`. The current value of `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`. If the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`, then `a` is set to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is set to `l[x]`.**
