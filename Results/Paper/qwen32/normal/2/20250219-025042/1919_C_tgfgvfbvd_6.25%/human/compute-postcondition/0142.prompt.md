Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers derived from the input, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element, or 0 if no such element exists, `c` is 0, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element, or `n-1` if no such element exists.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
        if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
        c += 1
    elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
        if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    elif a >= l[x]:
        a = l[x]
    else:
        b = l[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers derived from the input that must contain at least one element greater than its preceding element, `a` is either the first element of the list `l` or `l[x]` depending on the condition, `b` is either the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element or `l[x]` depending on the condition, `c` is 1 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, otherwise `c` is 0, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element, and `y` must be less than `n-1`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a` is greater than or equal to `l[x] - b`; otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x]` is greater than `a`; otherwise, `a` remains the first element of the list `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers derived from the input that must contain at least one element greater than its preceding element, `a` is either the first element of the list `l` or `l[x]` depending on the condition, `b` is either the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element or `l[x]` depending on the condition, `c` is 2 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, otherwise `c` is 1 if `l[x]` is greater than either `a` or `b`, and `c` is 0 if `l[x]` is not greater than either `a` or `b`. `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element, and `y` must be less than `n-1`, `x` is `y + 2`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is set to 2. If `l[x]` is greater than either `a` or `b` but not both, then `c` is set to 1. If `l[x]` is not greater than either `a` or `b`, then `c` is set to 0. Additionally, if `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, `a` is set to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, otherwise `b` is set to `l[y + 2]`. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, `a` is set to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, otherwise `b` is set to `l[y + 2]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, `a` is set to `l[x]` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, otherwise `b` is set to `l[x]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers derived from the input that must contain at least one element greater than its preceding element, `a` is either the first element of the list `l` or `l[x-1]` depending on the condition, `b` is either the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element or `l[x-1]` depending on the condition, `c` is determined based on the comparison of `l[x-1]` with `a` and `b`, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element, and `y` must be less than `n-1`, `x` is `y + 3`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is incremented by 1, and if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, then `a` is set to `l[y + 3]`; otherwise, `b` is set to `l[y + 3]`. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then if `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, `a` is set to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`; otherwise, `b` is set to `l[y+3]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, `a` becomes `l[x]`; otherwise, `b` becomes `l[x]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
