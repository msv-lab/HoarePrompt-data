Postcondition: **`l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is either the first element of `l` or `l[4]` depending on the conditions, `b` is either the first element in `l` that is greater than its predecessor (or 0 if no such element exists) or `l[4]` depending on the conditions, `c` is 2 if `l[4]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, otherwise `c` is 1 if `l[4]` is greater than either `a` or `b` but not both, and `c` is 0 if `l[4]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, `y` is 0, and `n` is the length of the list `l`. `x` is 4.**
