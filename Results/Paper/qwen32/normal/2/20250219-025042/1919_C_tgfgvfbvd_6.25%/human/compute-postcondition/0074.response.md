The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `l`. The variable `n` is not modified by this code snippet, but it is mentioned that `n` determines the range or number of iterations left to complete, which is not directly relevant to the current operation.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `l`, which is now a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
