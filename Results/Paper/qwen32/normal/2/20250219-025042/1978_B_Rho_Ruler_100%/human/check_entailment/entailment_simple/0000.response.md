### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum profit Bob can achieve by selling `n` buns with a promotional pricing strategy. The strategy involves selling the first `k` buns at decreasing prices starting from `b` down to `b-k+1`, and the remaining `n-k` buns at the usual price `a`.

The provided solution uses a binary search approach to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Binary Search Setup**: The search range for `k` is set between `0` and `min(n, b)`. This is because selling more than `b` buns at the promotional price doesn't make sense since the price would drop below `0`.

2. **Profit Calculation**: For any given `k`, the profit is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{profit} = k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a
   \]
   This formula accounts for the sum of the first `k` terms of the sequence `b, b-1, ..., b-k+1` and the remaining `n-k` buns sold at the usual price `a`.

3. **Binary Search Execution**: The binary search iteratively narrows down the range of `k` by comparing the profit at the midpoint (`mid`) with the profit at the next point (`mid + 1`). If the profit at `mid + 1` is higher, it means increasing `k` could potentially yield a higher profit, so the search continues in the upper half. Otherwise, it searches in the lower half.

4. **Max Profit Tracking**: During each iteration, the maximum profit encountered so far is tracked and updated.

5. **Return Value**: After the binary search completes, the function returns the maximum profit found.

### Verification Against Example Test Cases:

Let's verify the solution against the example test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**: `n=4, a=4, b=5`
   - Optimal `k` is `1`.
   - Profit: `1*5 + 3*4 = 5 + 12 = 17`.

2. **Test Case 2**: `n=5, a=5, b=9`
   - Optimal `k` is `5`.
   - Profit: `5*9 - (5*4)/2 = 45 - 10 = 35`.

3. **Test Case 3**: `n=10, a=10, b=5`
   - Optimal `k` is `0`.
   - Profit: `10*10 = 100`.

4. **Test Case 4**: `n=5, a=5, b=11`
   - Optimal `k` is `5`.
   - Profit: `5*11 - (5*4)/2 = 55 - 10 = 45`.

5. **Test Case 5**: `n=1000000000, a=1000000000, b=1000000000`
   - Optimal `k` is `1000000000`.
   - Profit: `1000000000*1000000000 - (1000000000*999999999)/2 = 1000000000000000000`.

6. **Test Case 6**: `n=1000000000, a=1000000000, b=1`
   - Optimal `k` is `0`.
   - Profit: `1000000000*1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`.

7. **Test Case 7**: `n=1000, a=1, b=1000`
   - Optimal `k` is `1000`.
   - Profit: `1000*1000 - (1000*999)/2 = 500500`.

The provided solution correctly computes the maximum profit for all these test cases.
