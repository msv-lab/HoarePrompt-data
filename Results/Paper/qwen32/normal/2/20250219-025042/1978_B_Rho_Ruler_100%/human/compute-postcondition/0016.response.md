The code updates the `max_profit` variable by comparing its current value with `profit_mid`. The values of `mid`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `profit_mid`, and `profit_next` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mid` is `(low + high) // 2`; `n` is unchanged; `a` is unchanged; `b` is unchanged; `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`; `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`; `max_profit` is the maximum of its previous value and `profit_mid`.**
