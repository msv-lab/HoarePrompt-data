Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of buns, `a` is a positive integer representing the usual price of a bun, `b` is a positive integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, `low` is 0, `high` is `min(n, b)`, `max_profit` is 0, `mid` is `(min(n, b)) // 2`, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `profit_next` is now calculated as the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`. All other variables retain their previous values.
