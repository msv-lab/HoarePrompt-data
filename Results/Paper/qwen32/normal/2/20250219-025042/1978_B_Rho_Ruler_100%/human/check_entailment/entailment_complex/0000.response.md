### Reasoning:

To solve the problem, we need to find the optimal number of buns \( k \) to sell at the modified price to maximize the total profit. The profit calculation involves two parts:
1. The sum of the prices of the first \( k \) buns sold at the modified price, which is given by the formula \( k \times b - k \times \left(\frac{k - 1}{2}\right) \).
2. The sum of the prices of the remaining \( n - k \) buns sold at the usual price, which is given by the formula \( (n - k) \times a \).

The total profit is the sum of these two parts. To find the maximum profit, we need to evaluate the profit for different values of \( k \) and choose the one that gives the highest profit.

The provided code uses a binary search approach to efficiently find the optimal \( k \). Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the code works:
1. **Initialization**: The variables `low` and `high` are initialized to 0 and `min(n, b)` respectively. This is because \( k \) can range from 0 to the minimum of \( n \) and \( b \).
2. **Binary Search Loop**: The loop continues until `low` is greater than `high`.
   - **Mid Calculation**: The middle point `mid` is calculated as the average of `low` and `high`.
   - **Profit Calculation**: The profit for `mid` and `mid + 1` is calculated using `func_1`.
   - **Max Profit Update**: The maximum profit seen so far is updated.
   - **Adjusting Search Range**: If the profit for `mid + 1` is greater than the profit for `mid`, it means that increasing \( k \) might yield a higher profit, so `low` is set to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `high` is set to `mid - 1`.
3. **Return Value**: After the loop, the maximum profit found is returned.

The function `func_1` correctly implements the formula to calculate the profit for a given \( k \), and `func_2` correctly uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \).

Given the problem constraints and the implementation details, the code should correctly compute the maximum profit for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct as it correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit by selling the buns according to the given conditions.

**Correctness: True**
