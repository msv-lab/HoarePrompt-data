To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `low <= high`.

Given:
- `low` is initialized to 0.
- `high` is initialized to `min(n, b)`.

For the loop to execute, the condition `low <= high` must be true. Since `low` is already set to 0, we need to ensure that `high` is at least 0. Given that `high` is defined as `min(n, b)`, and both `n` and `b` are positive integers, `min(n, b)` will always be a positive integer (at least 1), ensuring that `high` is always greater than or equal to 0.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the states of `low` and `high` because the condition `low <= high` will naturally be satisfied given the initializations and the constraints on `n` and `b`.

Thus, the state remains unchanged:

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of buns, `a` is a positive integer representing the usual price of a bun, `b` is a positive integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, `low` is 0, `high` is `min(n, b)`, `max_profit` is 0**
