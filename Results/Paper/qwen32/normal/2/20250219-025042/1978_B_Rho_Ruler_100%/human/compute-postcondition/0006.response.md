The code updates `max_profit` to be the maximum of its current value and `profit_mid`. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `profit_mid`, and `profit_next` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of buns, `a` is a positive integer representing the usual price of a bun, `b` is a positive integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, `low` is 0, `high` is `min(n, b)`, `max_profit` is `max(0, profit_mid)`, `mid` is `(min(n, b)) // 2`, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`**.
