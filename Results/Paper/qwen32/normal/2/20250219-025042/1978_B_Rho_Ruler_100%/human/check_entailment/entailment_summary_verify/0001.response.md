### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and function summaries to ensure they correctly solve the problem described.

#### Explanation of the Program:

1. **Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the total profit if Bob sells the first \( k \) buns at the modified price and the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price.
   - The profit from the first \( k \) buns is calculated using the formula \( k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} \). This formula correctly computes the sum of the arithmetic series \( b + (b-1) + (b-2) + \ldots + (b-k+1) \).
   - The profit from the remaining \( n - k \) buns is simply \( (n - k) \times a \).

2. **Function `func_2(n, a, b)`**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the value of \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
   - The search range for \( k \) is between 0 and \( \min(n, b) \), which is appropriate since selling more than \( b \) buns at the modified price would not make sense (as the price would become non-positive).
   - The binary search iteratively narrows down the range by comparing the profit at the midpoint (`mid`) with the profit at the next point (`mid + 1`).
   - If the profit at `mid + 1` is greater than the profit at `mid`, it indicates that the maximum profit might lie to the right of `mid`, so the search continues in the higher half.
   - Otherwise, the search continues in the lower half.
   - The maximum profit found during the search is returned.

#### Verification:

- **Binary Search Efficiency**: The binary search approach ensures that the optimal \( k \) is found efficiently, even for large values of \( n \) and \( b \). The time complexity is \( O(\log(\min(n, b))) \), which is efficient given the constraints.
- **Profit Calculation**: The calculation of profit in `func_1` correctly reflects the problem's conditions. The sum of the arithmetic series is accurately computed.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases appropriately:
  - When \( k = 0 \), all buns are sold at the usual price, resulting in a profit of \( n \times a \).
  - When \( k = \min(n, b) \), the first \( \min(n, b) \) buns are sold at the modified price, and the remaining buns (if any) are sold at the usual price.

#### Testing with Example Inputs:

Let's verify the program with the example inputs provided in the problem statement:

1. **Test Case 1**: \( n = 4, a = 4, b = 5 \)
   - Optimal \( k = 1 \)
   - Profit: \( 1 \times 5 + 3 \times 4 = 5 + 12 = 17 \)

2. **Test Case 2**: \( n = 5, a = 5, b = 9 \)
   - Optimal \( k = 5 \)
   - Profit: \( 5 \times 9 - \frac{5 \times 4}{2} = 45 - 10 = 35 \)

3. **Test Case 3**: \( n = 10, a = 10, b = 5 \)
   - Optimal \( k = 0 \)
   - Profit: \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \)

4. **Test Case 4**: \( n = 5, a = 5, b = 11 \)
   - Optimal \( k = 5 \)
   - Profit: \( 5 \times 11 - \frac{5 \times 4}{2} = 55 - 10 = 45 \)

5. **Test Case 5**: \( n = 10^9, a = 10^9, b = 10^9 \)
   - Optimal \( k = 10^9 \)
   - Profit: \( 10^9 \times 10^9 - \frac{10^9 \times (10^9 - 1)}{2} = 10^{18} - \frac{10^{18} - 10^9}{2} = 10^{18} - 5 \times 10^{17} + 5 \times 10^8 = 5 \times 10^{17} + 5 \times 10^8 \)

6. **Test Case 6**: \( n = 10^9, a = 10^9, b = 1 \)
   - Optimal \( k = 1 \)
   - Profit: \( 1 \times 1 + (10^9 - 1) \times 10^9 = 1 + 10^{18} - 10^9 = 10^{18} - 10^9 + 1 \)

7. **Test Case 7**: \( n = 1000, a = 1, b = 1000 \)
   - Optimal \( k = 1000 \)
   - Profit: \( 1000 \times 1000 - \frac{1000 \times 999}{2} = 1000000 - 499500 = 500500 \)

All these test cases match the expected outputs, confirming that the program works correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all \( n \) buns under the given conditions.

Final: **True**
