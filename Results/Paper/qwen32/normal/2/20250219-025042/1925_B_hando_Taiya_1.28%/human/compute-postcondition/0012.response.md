To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

Given:
- The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `isqrt(x) + 1`.
- `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\).
- `i` is the current iteration variable.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has some value, and `x` remains unchanged. To proceed to the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Current State:** At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value (let's call it `i_prev`), and `x` is unchanged.
2. **Next Iteration:** For the loop to execute again, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

Since `x` does not change within the loop head, it remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `x` remains the same.

**Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `i` is `i_prev + 1`**.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `i_prev`, we can generalize it as:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `i` is incremented by 1**.

For clarity, let's assume `i_prev` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, the next value of `i` would be `i_prev + 1`.

So the final state would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Thus, the final answer is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `i` is incremented by 1**.
