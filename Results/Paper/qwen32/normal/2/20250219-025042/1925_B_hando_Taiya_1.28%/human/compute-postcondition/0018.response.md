To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):`, which means the only variable that can be adjusted is `i`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\) and \(1 \leq n \leq x\)
- `i` is incremented by 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, so it needs to be adjusted to the next value for the next iteration. The loop runs as long as `i` is less than or equal to `isqrt(x)`.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

Since `t`, `x`, and `n` are not part of the loop head, they remain unchanged.

### Step-by-step Adjustment:
1. Identify the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, denoted as `i_prev`.
2. Increment `i_prev` by 1 to get the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\) and \(1 \leq n \leq x\), `i` is \(i_{prev} + 1\)**

However, since we don't have the exact value of `i_prev`, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\) and \(1 \leq n \leq x\), `i` is incremented by 1**

If we assume `i_prev` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be `i_prev + 1`. Since we don't have `i_prev`, we just say `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Thus, the final state can be written as:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\) and \(1 \leq n \leq x\), `i` is incremented by 1**
