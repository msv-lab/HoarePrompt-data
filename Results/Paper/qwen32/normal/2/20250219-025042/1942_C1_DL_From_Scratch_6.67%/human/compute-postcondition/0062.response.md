Postcondition: **`T` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `x` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 1, `y` is the third integer read from the input, `list0` is a new sorted list of `x` distinct integers read from the input, `i` is `x - 1`, `num` is `list0[x - 1] - list0[x - 2] - 1`. If `num` is 1, `count` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.**
