Postcondition: **T is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is the first integer read from the input, x is the integer read from the input such that x > 1, y is the third integer read from the input, list0 is a sorted list of x distinct integers provided in the second line of each test case, each ranging from 1 to n, num is n - list0[-1]. If num equals 1, count is 3. Otherwise, count remains 2.**
