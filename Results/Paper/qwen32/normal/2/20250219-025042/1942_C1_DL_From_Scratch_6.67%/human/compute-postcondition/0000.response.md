The code reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `T`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of distinct integers) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5); `y` is 0; there are x distinct integers provided in the second line of each test case, each ranging from 1 to n. The sum of x across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
