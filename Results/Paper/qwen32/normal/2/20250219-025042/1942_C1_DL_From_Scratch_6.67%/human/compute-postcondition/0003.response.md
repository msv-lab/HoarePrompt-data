The provided code snippet reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to the variable `list0`. This operation does not affect the values of `T`, `t`, `n`, `x`, or `y`.

Given the initial state, the output state will reflect the new value of `list0` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer read from the input, `x` is the second integer read from the input, `y` is the third integer read from the input; `list0` is a list of x distinct integers provided in the second line of each test case, each ranging from 1 to n.**
