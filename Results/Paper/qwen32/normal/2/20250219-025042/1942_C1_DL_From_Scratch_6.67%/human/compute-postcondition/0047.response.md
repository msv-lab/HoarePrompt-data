Postcondition: **`T` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `x` is the second integer read from the input, `y` is the third integer read from the input, `list0` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers, `num` is `n - list0[-1]`, `i` is `x - 2`. If `num` equals 1, `count` is the total number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` was exactly 1 plus 1. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.**
