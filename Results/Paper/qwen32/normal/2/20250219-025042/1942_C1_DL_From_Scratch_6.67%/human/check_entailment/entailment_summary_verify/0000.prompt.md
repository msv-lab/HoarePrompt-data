You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        count = 0
        for i in range(x - 1):
            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        num = n - list0[-1]
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        print(count + x - 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case it receives an integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a list of `x` distinct integers ranging from 1 to `n`. It calculates and prints a value based on the gaps between the integers in the list and the boundaries defined by `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed. Let's analyze the logic and identify the issues.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Counting Triangles Between Chosen Vertices:**
   - The program currently counts the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive chosen vertices and adds `x - 2` to the count. This approach is flawed because it does not consider all possible ways to form triangles using the chosen vertices.
   
2. **Handling the Circular Nature of the Polygon:**
   - The program does not handle the circular nature of the polygon correctly. It only checks the gaps between consecutive vertices in the sorted list and the gap between the last and first vertex. However, it does not consider the possibility of forming triangles that wrap around the polygon.

### Correct Approach

To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the following:

1. **Sorting the Vertices:**
   - Sort the list of chosen vertices to facilitate the counting process.

2. **Counting Triangles:**
   - For each set of three consecutive vertices in the sorted list, check if they can form a triangle. Also, consider the possibility of forming triangles that wrap around the polygon by checking the vertices at the beginning and end of the list.

3. **Circular Wrapping:**
   - After processing the vertices in the sorted order, also check the possibility of forming triangles using the last vertex and the first few vertices.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails

Consider the following test case:

```
1
8 4 0
1 3 6 8
```

#### Expected Output:
- The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 3. Possible triangles are (1, 3, 6), (3, 6, 8), and (6, 8, 1).

#### Actual Output from the Program:
- The program will output 2 because it only counts the gaps of size 1 and the wrap-around gap, which results in counting only two triangles: (1, 3, 6) and (6, 8, 1). It misses the triangle (3, 6, 8).

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly account for all possible ways to form triangles, especially when considering the circular nature of the polygon. Therefore, it is incorrect for at least one input case, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
