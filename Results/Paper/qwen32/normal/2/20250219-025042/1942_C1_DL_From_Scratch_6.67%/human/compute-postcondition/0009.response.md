The code snippet increments the value of `count` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer read from the input, `x` is an integer read from the input such that x > 1, `y` is the third integer read from the input; `list0` is a sorted list of x distinct integers provided in the second line of each test case, each ranging from 1 to n; `count` is 1; `num` is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1` and `num` equals 1**.
