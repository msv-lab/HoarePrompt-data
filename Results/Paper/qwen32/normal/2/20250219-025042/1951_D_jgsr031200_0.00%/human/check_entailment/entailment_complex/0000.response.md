### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem requirements.

#### Key Points from the Problem Statement:
1. **Objective**: Bob needs to set up at most 60 stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
2. **Constraints**:
   - Alice buys greedily, starting from the first stall and moving to the next.
   - Each stall can have an unlimited number of jewels.
   - The price per jewel at each stall is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\).
3. **Output Requirements**:
   - For each test case, print "YES" if it's possible to set up the stalls as required, otherwise print "NO".
   - If "YES", also print the number of stalls (`s`) and their respective prices (`p_1, p_2, ..., p_s`).

#### Analysis of the Provided Code:
- The code reads multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, k)` where `n` is the number of coins Alice has and `k` is the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy.
- Inside `func_1`:
  - If `n == k`, it prints "YES", then "1", and finally "1". This is incorrect because it should print the price of the jewel, which should be 1, but the output format requires specifying the price.
  - If `n < k`, it correctly prints "NO".
  - If `n >= k`, it initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]` and calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy (`h`). However, the logic for calculating `h` and adjusting `n` is flawed and does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
  - The final check if `h < k` is correct in determining if it's impossible to meet the requirement, but the logic for constructing the prices is incorrect.

#### Issues in the Code:
- **Initialization of `costs`**: The initial values `[n - k + 1, 1]` do not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.
- **Calculation of `h` and `n`**: The loop and calculations inside the loop do not correctly simulate the greedy buying behavior of Alice.
- **Output Format**: The output format when `n == k` is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic for setting up the stalls and calculating the prices is flawed, and the output format is incorrect in some cases.

**Correctness: False**
