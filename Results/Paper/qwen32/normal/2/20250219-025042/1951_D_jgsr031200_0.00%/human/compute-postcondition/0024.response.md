To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop based on the given information:

1. The loop iterates over the `costs` list, which initially contains two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
2. In the first iteration, `i` takes the value `n - k + 1`. The variable `curr` is calculated as `n // i`, which is `n // (n - k + 1)`. This will typically be 1 unless `n` is very close to `k`.
3. `h` is incremented by `curr`, and `n` is reduced by `i * curr`.
4. In the second iteration, `i` takes the value `1`. Since `n` has been reduced in the previous iteration, `curr` becomes `n // 1`, which is simply `n`. Thus, `h` is incremented by `n`, and `n` becomes `0` because `n - 1 * n` equals `0`.
5. In the third iteration, `i` is still `1`, but since `n` is already `0`, `curr` remains `0`. Consequently, `h` does not change, and `n` remains `0`.

Since `n` becomes `0` after the second iteration, the loop terminates after the second iteration itself because there are no more elements in the `costs` list to process. Therefore, the third iteration described in the problem statement is not actually executed.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`; `curr` is `n`; `h` is `h + n`; `n` is `0`; `i` is `1`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `n` becomes `0`, `h` is increased by the original value of `n`, and the loop terminates after processing the first two elements of the `costs` list.
