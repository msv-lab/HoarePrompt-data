The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `costs` list and the current value of `i`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the first element of the `costs` list, which is `n - k + 1`. After this iteration, `i` should take the next value from the `costs` list, which is `1`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be updated to the next value in the `costs` list.

State: **`costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`; `curr` is `n // i`; `h` is `h + (n // i)`; `n` is `n - i * curr`; `i` is `1`**
