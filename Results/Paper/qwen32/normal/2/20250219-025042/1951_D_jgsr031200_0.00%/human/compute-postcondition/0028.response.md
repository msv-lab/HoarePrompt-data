Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `costs` is a list: `[n - k + 1, 1]`
- `curr` is set to `n`
- `h` is updated to `h + n`
- `n` is set to `0`
- `i` is set to `1`
- It is also mentioned that `h` is greater than or equal to `k`

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print(2)`. This means that regardless of the values of the variables `costs`, `curr`, `h`, `n`, and `i`, the number `2` will be printed.

### Output:
The print statement will output the number `2`.

Output: **2**
