### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective**: Bob needs to set up at most 60 stalls with specific prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins.
- **Constraints**:
  - `1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}`
  - Alice buys greedily, starting from the first stall and moving to subsequent stalls until she cannot afford more jewels.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem but has several issues:
1. **Function Call Error**: The function `func_1(n, k)` is called without being defined, leading to a `NameError`.
2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic for setting up the stalls is incorrect. It only considers two stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]` and checks if the total number of jewels bought equals `k`. This is insufficient and incorrect for general cases.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, especially when `n` is large and `k` is small.
4. **Stall Limit**: The program does not ensure that the number of stalls is within the 60-stall limit.

#### Annotations:
Annotations show the state of the program before and after key operations. However, they do not indicate that the logic is correct or that the constraints are met. Specifically:
- The program initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]` and calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy with these prices.
- It then checks if the total number of jewels (`h`) is less than `k`. If so, it prints "NO"; otherwise, it prints "YES" along with the prices.

#### Corrected Approach:
A correct approach involves setting up the prices of the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. A greedy strategy can be used where the prices are chosen to maximize the number of jewels Alice can buy at each stall while ensuring she buys exactly `k` jewels in total. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    
    if n == k:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(1)
        continue
    
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
        continue
    
    stalls = []
    remaining_jewels = k
    remaining_coins = n
    
    # Use binary search to find the maximum number of jewels Alice can buy at each stall
    for i in range(1, 61):
        if remaining_jewels == 0:
            break
        
        max_price = remaining_coins // remaining_jewels
        if max_price == 0:
            break
        
        stalls.append(max_price)
        remaining_jewels -= 1
        remaining_coins -= max_price
    
    if remaining_jewels == 0:
        print('YES')
        print(len(stalls))
        print(*stalls)
    else:
        print('NO')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to improper logic and failure to meet the constraints. The annotations confirm the incorrect behavior of the program. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
