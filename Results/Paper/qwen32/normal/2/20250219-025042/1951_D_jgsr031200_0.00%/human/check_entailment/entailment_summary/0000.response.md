### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the given program and compare it against the requirements specified in the problem statement.

1. **Base Cases:**
   - If `n == k`, the program correctly outputs "YES", followed by `1` (the number of stalls), and `1` (the price per jewel). This makes sense because if Alice has exactly `k` coins, she can buy `k` jewels at a price of `1` coin each.
   - If `n < k`, the program correctly outputs "NO". This is also correct because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.

2. **General Case:**
   - For the general case where `n > k`, the program attempts to calculate a solution using a list `costs` initialized with `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - It then calculates how many jewels Alice can buy at these prices and checks if the total number of jewels (`h`) is at least `k`.
   - If `h < k`, it outputs "NO".
   - Otherwise, it outputs "YES" along with the number of stalls (`2`) and the prices in the `costs` list.

However, there are several issues with this approach:

- **Incorrect Logic for General Case:** The current logic does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. The chosen prices `[n - k + 1, 1]` are arbitrary and do not ensure that the total number of jewels bought will sum up to `k`.
- **Number of Stalls Constraint:** The problem requires setting up at most 60 stalls, but the program only considers 2 stalls in the general case.
- **Price Calculation:** The program does not properly distribute the cost across multiple stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. It should consider a strategy that allows for more flexible pricing across multiple stalls.

### Conclusion:

Given the above points, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Specifically, it fails to provide a valid configuration of stall prices that ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels when `n > k`.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
