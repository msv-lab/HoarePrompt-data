The given code calculates a new variable `sums` based on the existing variables `sum1` and `a`. Specifically, `sums` is computed as `sum1` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of the list `a`.

Given that `a` is a reversed sorted list, the first `x` elements of `a` are the `x` largest elements in the original list. The sum of these `x` elements is then doubled and subtracted from `sum1`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are integers read from the input.
- `a` remains a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input.
- `sum1` remains the sum of the elements in `a`.
- `ans` remains an empty list.
- `i` remains 0.
- `sums` is now calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
