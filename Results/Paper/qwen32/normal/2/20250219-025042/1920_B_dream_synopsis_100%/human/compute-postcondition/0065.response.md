Given the code snippet `sums = sums + a[i - 1]`, let's determine the new state of the variables.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is at least 0
- `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`
- `ans` is a list containing one element. If `i` is 0, `ans` contains `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, `ans` contains the value of `sums`.
- `i + x - 1` is less than `n` or not (this condition affects how `sums` is updated)
- `i` is `k + 1`
- `sums` is updated based on the condition `if i + x - 1 < n`:
  - If true, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`
  - If false, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`

Since the given code snippet is `sums = sums + a[i - 1]`, we assume the condition `i + x - 1 >= n` is true, because if it were false, the code would look different (`sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`).

Thus, `sums` is simply incremented by `a[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is at least 0; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing one element. If `i` is 0, `ans` contains `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, `ans` contains the value of `sums`; `i` is `k + 1`; `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
