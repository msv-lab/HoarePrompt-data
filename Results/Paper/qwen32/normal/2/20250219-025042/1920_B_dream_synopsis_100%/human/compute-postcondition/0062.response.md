Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is at least 0; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing two elements, the first being `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and the second also being `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`; `i` is `k + 1`; `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `ans` originally contained one element, which was `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. After executing the code `ans.append(sums)`, `ans` now contains two elements, both of which are `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. All other variables remain unchanged.
