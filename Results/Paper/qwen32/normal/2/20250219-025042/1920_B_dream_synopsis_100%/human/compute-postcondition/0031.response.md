The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. This means that the list `ans` now contains three elements: the original two elements followed by the newly appended `sums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing three elements, the last of which is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`; `i` is `i + 1`; `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
