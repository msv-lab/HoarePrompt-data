To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop evolves with each iteration. The loop runs for `k + 1` iterations, and during each iteration, it updates the `sums` variable based on specific conditions and appends the result to the `ans` list.

Here's a breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. **Initialization (i = 0)**:
   - `sums` is initialized to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
   - This value is appended to `ans`.

2. **Subsequent Iterations (i > 0)**:
   - If `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
   - If `i + x - 1 >= n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.
   - Each new `sums` value is appended to `ans`.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates after `k + 1` iterations.

Given the above logic, the final output state will be:

- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `sum1` remains unchanged.
- `ans` will contain `k + 1` elements, each representing the computed `sums` value for each iteration.

Let's formalize this understanding into the required format:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `x` are integers read from the input; `k` is an integer read from the input and is at least 0; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` values of `sums` computed according to the loop's logic.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all `k + 1` iterations, the `ans` list will have `k + 1` elements, each representing the computed `sums` value for each iteration, while all other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `sum1`) remain unchanged.
