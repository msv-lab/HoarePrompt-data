The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `ans`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`) are modified by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is an empty list.**
