The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust the value of `i` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n`, `k` (both at least 0), and `x` are integers read from the input
- `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`
- `ans` is a list containing two elements, calculated based on the value of `i`
- `i` is incremented by 1

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has already been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented again by 1.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. The value of `i` at the start of the next iteration will be `i_prev + 1`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we'll represent it as `i + 1` (since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration).

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k` (both at least 0), and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing two elements; `i` is `i + 1`**
