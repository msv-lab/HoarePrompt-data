The code snippet appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. 

Given the initial state, `ans` is already a list containing two elements. After appending `sums`, `ans` will now contain three elements.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k` (both at least 0), and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing three elements, the last of which is `sums`; `i` is `i + 1`; `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
