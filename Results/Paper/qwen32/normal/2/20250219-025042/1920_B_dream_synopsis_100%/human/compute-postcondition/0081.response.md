The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. This means the values of `n`, `k`, and `x` will be updated based on the input, while the other variables (`t`, `a`, `sum1`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, where each element is computed based on the logic: for `i = 0`, `ans[0] = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`; for `i > 0`, `ans[i]` is updated according to the rules specified in the loop.**
