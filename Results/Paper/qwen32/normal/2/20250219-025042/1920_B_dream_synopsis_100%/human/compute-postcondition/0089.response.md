The code calculates `sums` as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Here, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, and `a[:x]` represents the first `x` elements of the list `a`.

Given that `a` is a reversed sorted list, `a[:x]` contains the `x` largest elements of `a` (since the list is sorted in descending order). The code then subtracts twice the sum of these `x` largest elements from `sum1`.

No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `x` are integers read from the input; `k` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`; `ans` is an empty list; currently `i` is 0; `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
