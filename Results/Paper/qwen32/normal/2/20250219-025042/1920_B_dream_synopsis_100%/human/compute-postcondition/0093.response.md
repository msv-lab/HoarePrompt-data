Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `x` are integers read from the input; `k` is an integer read from the input and is at least 0; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is not equal to 0 and the current value of `i` satisfies the condition that (i + x - 1) < n; `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `sums` has been updated by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
