The code sorts the list `a`. This operation does not change the values of the elements in `a`, but it reorders them in ascending order. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `sum1`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the new `a`; `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, where each element is yet to be computed.**
