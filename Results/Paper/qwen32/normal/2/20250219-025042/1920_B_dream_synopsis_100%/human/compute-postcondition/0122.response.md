Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, `x`, and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum possible sum achievable by modifying up to `k` elements in the array `a` according to specific rules involving the top `x` elements.**
