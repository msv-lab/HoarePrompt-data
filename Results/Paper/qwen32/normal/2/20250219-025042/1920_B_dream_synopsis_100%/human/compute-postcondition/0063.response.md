To determine the new state after executing the given line of code, let's analyze the impact on the variables.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is at least 0
- `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`
- `ans` is a list containing one element. If `i` is 0, `ans` contains `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, `ans` contains the value of `sums`.
- `i` is `k + 1`
- `sums` is updated based on the condition `if i + x - 1 < n`.

The line of code to execute:
```python
sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
```

Since `i` is `k + 1`, the line of code updates `sums` as follows:
- `sums` is incremented by `a[k]` (since `i - 1` is `k`).
- `sums` is decremented by `2 * a[k + x]` (since `i + x - 1` is `k + x`).

Thus, the new value of `sums` is `sums + a[k] - 2 * a[k + x]`.

Other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is at least 0; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing one element. If `i` is 0, `ans` contains `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, `ans` contains the value of `sums`; `i` is `k + 1`; `sums` is updated to `sums + a[k] - 2 * a[k + x]`.**
