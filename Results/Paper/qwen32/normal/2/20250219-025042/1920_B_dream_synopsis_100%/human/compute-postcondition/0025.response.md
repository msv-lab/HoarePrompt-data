The given line of code `sums = sums + a[i - 1]` updates the value of `sums` by adding the element at index `i-1` of the list `a` to it.

Given the initial state, `sums` is initially calculated based on the value of `i`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 before this line of code is executed, we can assume that `i` has already been incremented. Therefore, `a[i - 1]` refers to the element at the index that was just processed.

The updated value of `sums` will be the previous value of `sums` plus `a[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k` (both at least 0), and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing one element, `sums`. If `i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, `sums` is updated based on the condition: if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, `sums` is the sum of its previous value and `a[i - 1]`. `i` is incremented by 1; `sums` is now `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
