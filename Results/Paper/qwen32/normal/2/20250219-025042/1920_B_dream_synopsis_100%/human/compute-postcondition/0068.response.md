Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is at least 0; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing two elements. If `i` is 0, both elements of `ans` are `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Otherwise, the second element of `ans` is the value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[k] - 2 * a[k + x]`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`. `i` is `k + 1`.**
