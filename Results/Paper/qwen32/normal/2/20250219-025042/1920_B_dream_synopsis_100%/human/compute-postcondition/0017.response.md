The code appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k` (both at least 0), and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`; `i` is not equal to 0; and `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`; `sums` is the sum of its previous value and `a[i - 1]`.**
