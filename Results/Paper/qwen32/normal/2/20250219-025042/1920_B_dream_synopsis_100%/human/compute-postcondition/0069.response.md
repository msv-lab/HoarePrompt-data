The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `k + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `k + 1`. However, since `i` is already `k + 1`, the loop will not execute again if we do not adjust `i`.

To make the loop execute one more time, we need to set `i` to a value that is less than `k + 1`. The natural choice would be to set `i` to its initial value, which is `0` (assuming the loop starts from `0`).

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is at least 0; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing two elements. If `i` is 0, both elements of `ans` are `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Otherwise, the second element of `ans` is the value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[k] - 2 * a[k + x]`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`. `i` is 0**
