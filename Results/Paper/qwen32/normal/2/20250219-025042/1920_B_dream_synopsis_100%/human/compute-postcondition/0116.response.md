Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4 - 1, `n`, `x` are integers read from the input, `k` is an integer read from the input and is at least 0, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the previous value(s) of `sums` and the current value of `sums`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`. The list `ans` now includes the newly appended value of `sums`.**
