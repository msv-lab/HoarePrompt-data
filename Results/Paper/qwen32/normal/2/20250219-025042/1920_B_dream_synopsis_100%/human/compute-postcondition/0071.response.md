The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` is defined as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and `ans` initially contains two elements, both equal to `sums`, after appending `sums` to `ans`, `ans` will contain three elements, all of which are `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is at least 0; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing three elements, all equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`; `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`; `i` is 0.**
