Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is at least 0; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing three elements. If `i` is 0, the first and second elements of `ans` are `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. The third element of `ans` is the value of `sums`. `i` is 0; `sums` is updated to `sums + a[-1] - 2 * a[x - 1]`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is that `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `i`, and `sums` retain their previous values except that `ans` now contains three elements instead of two. The third element of `ans` is the value of `sums`.
