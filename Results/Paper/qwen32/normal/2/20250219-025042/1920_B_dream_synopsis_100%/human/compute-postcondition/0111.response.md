Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4 - 1, `n`, `x` are integers read from the input, `k` is an integer read from the input and is at least 0, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the previous value(s) of `sums` and the current value of `sums`, `i` is `i + 1`, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. The list `ans` now includes the newly appended value of `sums`.**

In simple terms, the value of `sums` has been added to the list `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged.
