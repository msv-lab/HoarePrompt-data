Let's break down the logic of the program and see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine if we can select exactly `k/2` elements from each of two arrays `a` and `b` such that the selected elements together cover all integers from 1 to `k`.

### Key Points:
1. **Unique Elements**: We need to consider only the unique elements from each array that are less than or equal to `k`.
2. **Partitioning**: We partition these unique elements into three sets:
   - `only_a`: Elements present only in `a`.
   - `only_b`: Elements present only in `b`.
   - `both`: Elements present in both `a` and `b`.
3. **Constraints**:
   - The number of elements in `only_a` should not exceed `k/2`.
   - The number of elements in `only_b` should not exceed `k/2`.
   - The total number of distinct elements (`len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)`) should be at least `k`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads multiple test cases and stores them in a list called `cases`.
2. **Processing Each Case**:
   - It creates sets `unique_a` and `unique_b` from the lists `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - It filters out elements greater than `k` from these sets to get `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.
   - It calculates `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` using set operations.
   - It checks if the sizes of `only_a` and `only_b` are within the limit `k/2`.
   - It checks if the total number of distinct elements is at least `k`.
3. **Output**: Based on the above checks, it appends either 'YES' or 'NO' to the results list.

### Verification:
- **Correctness of Logic**: The logic ensures that we do not exceed the limit of `k/2` elements from each array and that we have enough distinct elements to cover all numbers from 1 to `k`.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles cases where there are no common elements, all elements are common, or some elements are only in one array.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem as per the given constraints and examples.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
