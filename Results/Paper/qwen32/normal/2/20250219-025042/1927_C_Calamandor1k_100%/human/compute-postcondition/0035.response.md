The `continue` statement in Python does not affect the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration. Since there are no loops explicitly mentioned in the provided context, the `continue` statement would typically be part of a loop structure that isn't shown here. Given the context, the `continue` statement doesn't change any of the variables listed in the initial state.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `cases` is a list containing at least one tuple (n', m', k', a', b'); `a` is a list of n' integers where 1 <= a'_i <= 10^6 for each i; `b` is a list of m' integers where 1 <= b'_j <= 10^6 for each j; `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from the list `a`; `unique_b` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`; `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`; `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`; `only_a` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`; `only_b` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`; `both` is a set containing elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`; `total_distinct` is `len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)`; `results` contains `'NO'` appended to its previous contents.**
