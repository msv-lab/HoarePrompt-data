Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is a non-empty string, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is the character at position `i` in `a`, `l` and `h` depend on the new value of `j`: if `j` equals 'A', then `l` is 1 and `h` is 1, otherwise, `l` is 0 and `h` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `h` is incremented by 1. If `j` was 'A', `h` was initially 0 and now becomes 1. If `j` was not 'A', `h` was initially 1 and now becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
