Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `a` is the new user's input as a string; `l` is the count of 'A's in `a`; `h` is the count of characters in `a` that are not 'A'. If `l` is greater than `h`, then `l` is the count of 'A's in `a` and is greater than `h`. Otherwise, `l` is less than or equal to `h`.**
