The only variable in the loop head is `j`, which iterates over the string `a`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `j` to reflect the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, and `j` took on the value of the current character in the string `a`. Since `a` is a non-empty string, there must be more characters to iterate over as long as `i` is less than the length of `a`.

Given that `j` represents the current character in the string `a`, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be the next character in the string. The values of `t`, `a`, `i`, `l`, and `h` are not part of the loop head and thus should remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is a non-empty string, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is the next character in `a`, if `j` equals 'A', then `l` is 1 and `h` is 0, otherwise, `l` is 0 and `h` is 1**.

However, since `i` is incremented by 1 and `j` is the next character in `a`, we should specify that `j` is the character at position `i` in `a`:

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is a non-empty string, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is the character at position `i` in `a`, if `j` equals 'A', then `l` is 1 and `h` is 0, otherwise, `l` is 0 and `h` is 1**.

To make it clear that `j` is the next character in the sequence:

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is a non-empty string, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is the character at position `i` in `a`, `l` and `h` depend on the new value of `j`: if `j` equals 'A', then `l` is 1 and `h` is 0, otherwise, `l` is 0 and `h` is 1**.
