To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the behavior of the loop based on the provided code and the initial conditions.

The loop runs `casos` times, where `casos` is an input integer. During each iteration, the value of `n` is read from the input, and based on its value, specific patterns are printed. The value of `n` does not affect the loop's control flow (i.e., the number of iterations), but it influences the output during each iteration.

Here's a summary of the loop's behavior:
- For each iteration `c` from 0 to `casos - 1`:
  - Read a new value of `n`.
  - Print different patterns based on the value of `n`.

After all iterations, the variables `t` and `n` will retain their most recent values as set during the last iteration of the loop. The variable `c` will be equal to `casos` after the loop completes, as it increments with each iteration until it reaches `casos`.

### Final Output State:
- `t`: Remains unchanged from its initial value.
- `n`: Takes the value of the last input read during the last iteration of the loop.
- `casos`: Remains unchanged from its initial value.
- `c`: Equals `casos` after the loop completes.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, `n` is the integer input during the last iteration, `casos` is the initial input integer, and `c` equals `casos`.**

In simple terms, after all iterations, `t` and `casos` stay the same, `c` becomes equal to `casos`, and `n` takes the value of the last input provided during the loop's execution.
