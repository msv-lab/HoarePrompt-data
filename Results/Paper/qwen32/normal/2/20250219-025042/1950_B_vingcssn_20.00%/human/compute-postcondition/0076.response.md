Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `casos` is greater than 0.
- `c` is 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('##..##')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward. It simply prints the string `'##..##'`.

### Variables and Objects:
- The variables `t`, `n`, `casos`, and `c` are mentioned in the initial state but they are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'##..##'` as it is explicitly specified in the code.

### Final Output:
Output: **##..##**
