In this task, the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `casos`, or `c`. The string `'##..##'` is explicitly provided within the `print` function.

Here's the breakdown:
- The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `n`, `casos`, `c`), but these are not used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'##..##'`.

Therefore, the output will be the exact string provided in the `print` statement.

Output: **##..##**
