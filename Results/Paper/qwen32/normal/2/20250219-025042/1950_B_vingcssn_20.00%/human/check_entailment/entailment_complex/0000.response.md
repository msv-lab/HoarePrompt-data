Reasoning: The given program is designed to handle test cases where the value of `n` is between 1 and 4. It correctly prints the 2x2, 4x4, 6x6, and 8x8 checkerboards as specified in the problem statement for these values of `n`. However, the program includes an `else` clause that outputs "No esta en el rango" (which translates to "Not in the range") for any `n` greater than 4. According to the problem statement, `n` can be as large as 20, so the program does not handle all possible valid inputs correctly. Therefore, the program is not fully correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
