The only variables in the loop head are `c` and `casos`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine if the loop can execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `c` is 0, and `casos` is greater than 0. Since the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `casos`, for the loop to execute one more time, `c` should be incremented by 1 (as it is the loop variable), and `casos` should remain unchanged because it defines the upper limit of the loop.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `c` will be 1, and `casos` will still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, `n` is an input integer, `casos` is greater than 0, and `c` is 1**
