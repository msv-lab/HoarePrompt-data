The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs a static string `'..##'`. This string does not depend on any of the variables (`t`, `n`, `casos`, `c`) mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of these variables do not influence the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Print Statement**: The `print` statement is `print('..##')`.
2. **Analyze the String**: The string `'..##'` is a literal and does not contain any variables or expressions that would change its value based on the initial state.
3. **Determine the Output**: Since the string is fixed, the output will always be `'..##'`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'..##'`.

Output: **..##**
