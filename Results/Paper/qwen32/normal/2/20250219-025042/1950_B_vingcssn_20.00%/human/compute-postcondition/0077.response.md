Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `casos` is greater than 0.
- `c` is 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('##..##..')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'##..##..'`. None of the variables `t`, `n`, `casos`, or `c` are used within this specific `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not influence the output.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'##..##..'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **##..##..**
