The `print` statement in the given Python code snippet is:

```python
print('##..##..')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'##..##..'`. None of the variables (`t`, `n`, `casos`, `c`) mentioned in the initial state are used within this `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not influence the output.

Output: **##..##..**
