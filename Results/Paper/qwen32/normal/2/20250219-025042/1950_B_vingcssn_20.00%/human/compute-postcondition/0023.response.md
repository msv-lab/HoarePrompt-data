The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a specific string `'##..##..'`. This string is hardcoded and does not depend on any of the variables (`t`, `n`, `casos`, `c`) mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of these variables do not influence the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, `casos`, and `c`, but none of these variables are used within the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'##..##..'`.

Given this, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not change based on the values of the variables.

Output: **##..##..**
