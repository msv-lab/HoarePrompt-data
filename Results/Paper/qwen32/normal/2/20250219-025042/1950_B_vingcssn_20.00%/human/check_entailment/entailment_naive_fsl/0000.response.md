Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program only handles specific cases for `n` equal to 1, 2, 3, and 4. It explicitly prints the checkerboard pattern for these values but does not handle any other values of `n` within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). For example, if the input includes a value of `n` greater than 4, such as 5, the program will output "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the corresponding checkerboard pattern. Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible valid inputs within the given constraints.
