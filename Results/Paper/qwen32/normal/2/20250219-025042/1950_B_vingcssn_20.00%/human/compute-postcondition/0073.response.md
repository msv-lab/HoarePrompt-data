Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `casos` is greater than 0.
- `c` is 2.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('..##..')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement `print('..##..')` directly outputs the string `'..##..'`. This string does not depend on any of the variables (`t`, `n`, `casos`, `c`) mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output will always be the same regardless of the values of these variables.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string `'..##..'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **..##..**
