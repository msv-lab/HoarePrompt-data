Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `casos` is greater than 0.
- `c` is 2.

The print statement is:
```python
print('..##..##')
```

This print statement directly outputs the string `'..##..##'`. None of the variables `t`, `n`, `casos`, or `c` are used within this print statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Based on the information provided, the output will be the exact string `'..##..##'`.

Output: **..##..##**
