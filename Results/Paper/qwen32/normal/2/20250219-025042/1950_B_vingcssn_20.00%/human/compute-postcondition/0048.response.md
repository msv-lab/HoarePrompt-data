Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
  - `n` is an input integer.
  - `casos` is greater than 0.
  - `c` is 1.

- **Print Statement:**
  ```python
  print('##..##')
  ```

From the initial state, we can see that there are several variables (`t`, `n`, `casos`, `c`) mentioned, but none of them are used in the print statement. The print statement directly outputs the string `'##..##'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply the string `'##..##'`.

Output: **##..##**
