Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` set to `curr_v`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + 2k` where `i` is the next integer in the range from `0` to `k-1`; `n` must be greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k`; `curr_v` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `curr_v` has been increased by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
