To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will continue as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than the length of the `permutation` list.

Given the current state:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n`.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is initially `1 + 2k`.
- `i` is 1.

The key variable here is `multiples_of_k_plus_i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`, which is `n`.

Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is calculated as `1 + 2k`, we need to ensure that `1 + 2k < n`. Given that `k` is even and \(2 \leq k \leq n\), the smallest possible value for `k` is 2. Therefore, the smallest possible value for `1 + 2k` is `1 + 2*2 = 5`.

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `n` must be greater than `1 + 2k`.

No other variables in the loop head (`multiples_of_k_plus_i` and `len(permutation)`) need to be adjusted directly since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is derived from `k` and `i`, and `len(permutation)` is derived from `n`.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than `1 + 2k`.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + 2k`; `i` is 1; `n` must be greater than `1 + 2k`**
