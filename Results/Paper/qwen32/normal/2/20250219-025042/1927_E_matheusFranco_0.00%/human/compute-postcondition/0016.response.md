The code snippet assigns the value of `curr_v` (which is 3) to the element in the `permutation` list at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i`. This means the element at the position `multiples_of_k_plus_i` in the `permutation` list, which was previously set to 2, will now be updated to 3.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are integers read from the input.
- `permutation` list will have its element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` changed from 2 to 3.
- `idx`, `idx_v`, and `curr_v` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with the first element set to 1, the element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` set to 3, and all other elements initialized to 0; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is 3; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be such that `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k < n`.**
