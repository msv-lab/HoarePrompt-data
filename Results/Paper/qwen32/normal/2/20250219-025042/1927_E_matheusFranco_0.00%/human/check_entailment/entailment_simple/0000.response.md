### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code to see if it correctly constructs a k-level permutation as per the problem statement.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
- It then enters a loop that runs `t` times, calling `func_1()` for each test case.
- After processing each test case, it decrements `t` until `t` becomes 0.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function reads the integers `n` and `k` for a single test case.
- It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with all zeros.
- It uses a nested loop structure to fill the `permutation` list:
  - The outer loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `k-1`.
  - The inner loop fills every `k`-th position starting from `i` with increasing values (`curr_v`).
- After filling the `permutation` list, it prints the permutation as a space-separated string.

#### Analysis of the Permutation Construction:
- The key idea is to distribute the numbers `1` to `n` in such a way that the sums of every segment of length `k` differ by at most 1.
- The provided code fills the permutation by placing numbers in a specific pattern:
  - For `i = 0`, it places `1, 2, 3, ..., ceil(n/k)` at indices `0, k, 2k, ...`.
  - For `i = 1`, it places `ceil(n/k)+1, ceil(n/k)+2, ...` at indices `1, k+1, 2k+1, ...`.
  - This pattern continues up to `i = k-1`.

#### Checking the k-Level Condition:
- To ensure the k-level condition, we need to check if the sums of every segment of length `k` differ by at most 1.
- Given the construction method, the numbers are distributed evenly across the segments.
- The difference between the sums of any two consecutive segments will be at most 1 because the numbers are placed in a balanced manner.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly constructs a k-level permutation for each test case. The distribution of numbers ensures that the sums of any two segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1, satisfying the problem's requirements.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
