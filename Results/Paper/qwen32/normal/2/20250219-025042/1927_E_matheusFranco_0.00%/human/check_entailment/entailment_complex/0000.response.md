### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code and see if it meets the problem requirements.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function constructs a permutation of length `n` based on the value of `k`.
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It then fills this list by placing values from 1 to `n` in positions that follow a specific pattern: for each `i` from 0 to `k-1`, it places the next available number in every `k`-th position starting from `i`.
   - After filling the list, it prints the permutation as a space-separated string.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to generate and print the required permutation.

### Analysis:

To verify the correctness of the program, we need to check if the generated permutation satisfies the condition of being a `k`-level permutation. Specifically, we need to ensure that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any continuous segment of length `k` in the permutation is at most 1.

Let's consider how the permutation is constructed:
- The permutation is filled in a way that ensures that the sums of every `k` consecutive elements are as evenly distributed as possible.
- By placing the numbers in a cyclic manner with a step of `k`, the sums of these segments will be close to each other, ensuring that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums is minimized.

Given the constraints and the construction method, the generated permutation should indeed be a `k`-level permutation. The example outputs provided in the problem statement also match the expected behavior of the code.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the program correctly constructs a `k`-level permutation for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
