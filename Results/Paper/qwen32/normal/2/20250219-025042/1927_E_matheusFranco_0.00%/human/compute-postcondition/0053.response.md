To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variables and Initial Values:**
   - `n` and `k` are integers where \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even.
   - `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values `1, 2, 3, ..., n` arranged in a specific pattern.
   - `idx` is initialized to 0.
   - `idx_v` is initialized to 1.
   - `curr_v` is initialized to `n+1`.
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is the last index filled in the final iteration.
   - `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements in `permutation`.

2. **Pattern Description:**
   - Given that `k` is even, the permutation likely follows a specific pattern involving multiples of `k` and other indices.
   - However, the exact pattern isn't explicitly described in the initial state, so we'll assume it fills the permutation list with values from 1 to `n` in some order.

3. **Result Construction:**
   - `result` is constructed by joining the elements of the `permutation` list into a single string with spaces separating the elements.

Given these points, the output of `print(result)` will be the space-separated string representation of the `permutation` list.

Since the exact pattern of the `permutation` list isn't specified, we can only describe the result in terms of the `permutation` list itself.

Output: **result (where result is the space-separated concatenation of the elements in the permutation list)**
