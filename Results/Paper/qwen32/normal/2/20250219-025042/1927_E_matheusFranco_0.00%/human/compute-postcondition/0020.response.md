To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which is `i` in this case. The loop iterates over the range of `k`, so `i` will take on values from `0` to `k-1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` and `k` are integers with \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n` with specific values set at certain indices.
- `idx` is 0.
- `idx_v` is 1.
- `curr_v` is `m+2`.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `n` that is a multiple of `k`.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(k):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken on the value `i-1` (since loops increment `i` at the end of each iteration). For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Let's assume the previous value of `i` was `i-1`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i`.

Since none of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `permutation`, `idx`, `idx_v`, `curr_v`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i`) are part of the loop head, they remain unchanged.

### Step-by-step Adjustment:
1. Identify the variable `i` from the loop head.
2. Increment `i` by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

### Example Calculation:
If the previous value of `i` was `0`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `1`.
If the previous value of `i` was `1`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `2`.
And so on...

### Final State:
Assuming the previous value of `i` was `i-1`, the new value of `i` at the start of the next iteration will be `i`.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values `1, 2, 3, ..., m+1` at indices `0, k, 2k, ..., mk` respectively, and `0` elsewhere; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `m+2`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `n` that is a multiple of `k`; `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since we don't know the exact previous value of `i`, we can generalize the state as follows:

State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values `1, 2, 3, ..., m+1` at indices `0, k, 2k, ..., mk` respectively, and `0` elsewhere; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `m+2`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `n` that is a multiple of `k`; `i` is the next integer in the range from 0 to k-1**.
