The given code snippet modifies the `permutation` list by assigning the value of `curr_v` to the index specified by `multiples_of_k_plus_i`. Let's break down the changes:

- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is initially set to 1.
- `curr_v` is initially set to `m+m+2`.

Therefore, the value at index 1 of the `permutation` list will be updated to `m+m+2`.

Given the initial state, the `permutation` list is structured as follows:
- Values `1, 2, 3, ..., m+1` are placed at indices `0, k, 2k, ..., mk`.
- Values `m+2, m+3, ..., m+m+1` are placed at indices `i, i+k, i+2k, ..., i+mk`.

Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1, and `curr_v` is `m+m+2`, the value at index 1 of the `permutation` list will be updated to `m+m+2`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values `1, 2, 3, ..., m+1` at indices `0, k, 2k, ..., mk` respectively, and `m+2, m+3, ..., m+m+1` at indices `i, i+k, i+2k, ..., i+mk` respectively except that `permutation[1]` is `m+m+2`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `m+m+2`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1; `i` is 1.**
