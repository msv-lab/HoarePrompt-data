To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the `permutation` list. The loop iterates `k` times, and during each iteration, it fills in parts of the `permutation` list starting from indices `0, 1, 2, ..., k-1` with consecutive values starting from `curr_v`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what happens:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `permutation` is initialized as a list of zeros of length `n`.
   - `curr_v` starts at 1.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration `i` from 0 to `k-1`, the loop fills in the `permutation` list at indices `i, i+k, i+2k, ..., i+mk` with values `curr_v, curr_v+1, curr_v+2, ..., curr_v+m`, where `m` is the largest integer such that `i+mk < n`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After all iterations, every index `j` in the `permutation` list will be filled with a unique value from 1 to `n` because each index `j` will be covered exactly once by one of the iterations.

Let's formalize this:

- The `permutation` list will contain values from 1 to `n` in a specific pattern determined by the multiples of `k` starting from each index `i` from 0 to `k-1`.
- `curr_v` will be incremented by the total number of elements filled in the `permutation` list, which is `n`.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be the last index filled in the final iteration, which is the largest multiple of `k` less than `n` plus the current `i`.

Given these points, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values `1, 2, 3, ..., n` distributed according to the pattern described above; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `n+1`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is the last index filled in the final iteration.**

In simpler terms, the `permutation` list will be completely filled with values from 1 to `n` in a specific pattern based on the multiples of `k`, and `curr_v` will be `n+1` since it was incremented `n` times.
