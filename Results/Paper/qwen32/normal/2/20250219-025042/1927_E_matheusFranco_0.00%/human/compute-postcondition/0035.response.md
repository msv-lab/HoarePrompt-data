To determine the final state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior:

1. The loop starts with `multiples_of_k_plus_i` initialized to `i`, which is initially 0.
2. In each iteration, it sets `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` to `curr_v`, then increments `curr_v` by 1.
3. It then increments `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k` to move to the next index in the sequence.
4. The loop continues until `multiples_of_k_plus_i` reaches or exceeds the length of `permutation`.

Since `k` is even and `multiples_of_k_plus_i` starts at `i` and increments by `k` each time, the loop will fill in the indices `i, i+k, i+2k, ..., i+mk` where `i+mk < n` and `i+(m+1)k >= n`.

Let's denote the final value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` as `i + mk`, where `i + (m+1)k >= n`. This means the last valid index filled in the permutation is `i + mk`.

Given the pattern, the final state of the variables will be:
- `permutation` will have values `1, 2, 3, ..., m+1` at indices `0, k, 2k, ..., mk` respectively, and `m+2, m+3, ..., m+m+1` at indices `i, i+k, i+2k, ..., i+mk` respectively.
- `curr_v` will be `m+m+2` (since it increments by 1 for each filled position).
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be `i + (m+1)k` but since it stops before reaching `n`, it will be `i + mk`.
- `i` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values `1, 2, 3, ..., m+1` at indices `0, k, 2k, ..., mk` respectively, and `m+2, m+3, ..., m+m+1` at indices `i, i+k, i+2k, ..., i+mk` respectively; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `m+m+2`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + mk`; `i` is the next integer in the range from 0 to k-1`.**

In simpler terms, the loop fills in the permutation list starting from index `i` with values `m+2, m+3, ..., m+m+1` at every `k`th position until it can no longer do so without exceeding the length of the list. The other variables remain unchanged except for those directly involved in the loop's operation.
