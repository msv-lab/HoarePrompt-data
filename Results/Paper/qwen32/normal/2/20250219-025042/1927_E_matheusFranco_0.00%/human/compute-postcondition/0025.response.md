The code increments the variable `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k`. Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` was initially set to `i`, its new value will be `i + k`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values `1, 2, 3, ..., m+1` at indices `0, k, 2k, ..., mk` respectively, except `permutation[i]` is now `m+2`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `m+3`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + k`; `i` is the next integer in the range from 0 to k-1`.**
