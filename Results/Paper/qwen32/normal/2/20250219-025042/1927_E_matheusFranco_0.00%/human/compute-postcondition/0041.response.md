The code increments the variable `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by the value of `k`. Given the initial state, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` was initially set to 1. After executing the line `multiples_of_k_plus_i += k`, the new value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` becomes `1 + k`.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values `1, 2, 3, ..., m+1` at indices `0, k, 2k, ..., mk` respectively, and `m+2, m+3, ..., m+m+1` at indices `i, i+k, i+2k, ..., i+mk` respectively except that `permutation[1]` is `m+m+2`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `m+m+3`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + k`; `i` is 1.**
