To determine the output state, we need to know what `func_1()` does. Since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine its effect on the variables. However, based on the given format and the information provided, we can infer that `func_1()` might modify the variable `t` or introduce new variables.

Since there's no specific definition or behavior of `func_1()`, let's assume that `func_1()` does not affect `t` or any other variables mentioned in the initial state. If `func_1()` does not alter `t` or introduce new variables, the output state would remain the same as the initial state.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is at least 1**.
