Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, such that 2 <= k <= n, and k is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with the first element set to 1, the element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` set to 2, and all other elements initialized to 0; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is 3; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `n`.**

Natural Language: The value of `curr_v` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables retain their initial values.
