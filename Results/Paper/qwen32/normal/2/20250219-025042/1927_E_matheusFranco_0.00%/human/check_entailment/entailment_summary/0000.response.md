### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program correctly solves the problem, we need to analyze whether the constructed permutation by `func_1` meets the criteria of a k-level permutation as defined in the problem statement.

#### Key Points from the Problem Statement:
1. **Permutation Definition**: A permutation of length `n` consists of distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
2. **k-Level Permutation**: A permutation is k-level if, among all sums of continuous segments of length `k`, any two sums differ by no more than 1.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Pattern Construction**: The function constructs a permutation by placing numbers in positions that are multiples of `k` plus some offset (`i`). Specifically, it fills positions `i, i+k, i+2k, ...` with consecutive values starting from 1.
- **Output Example**: For `n=10` and `k=4`, the output is `1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6`. Let's check if this permutation is k-level:
  - Sums of segments of length `k=4`:
    - `1 + 8 + 4 + 10 = 23`
    - `8 + 4 + 10 + 2 = 24`
    - `4 + 10 + 2 + 7 = 23`
    - `10 + 2 + 7 + 5 = 24`
    - `2 + 7 + 5 + 9 = 23`
    - `7 + 5 + 9 + 3 = 24`
    - `5 + 9 + 3 + 6 = 23`
  - Maximum sum: 24
  - Minimum sum: 23
  - Difference: 24 - 23 = 1, which satisfies the condition for a k-level permutation.

#### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Multiple Test Cases**: The function handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and calling `func_1` for each test case until `t` becomes 0.

### Conclusion:
The provided code constructs permutations that satisfy the conditions of being k-level permutations. The pattern used ensures that the sums of segments of length `k` do not vary by more than 1. Since the code correctly handles multiple test cases and constructs valid permutations for each, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
