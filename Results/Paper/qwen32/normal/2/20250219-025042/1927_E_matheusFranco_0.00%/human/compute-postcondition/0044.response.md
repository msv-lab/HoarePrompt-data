Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values `1, 2, 3, ..., m+1` at indices `0, k, 2k, ..., mk` respectively, and `m+2, m+3, ..., m+m+1` at indices `i, i+k, i+2k, ..., i+mk` respectively except that `permutation[1]` is `m+m+2` and `permutation[1 + k]` is `m + m + 3`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `m+m+4`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + k`; `i` is 1.** 

Explanation: The value of `curr_v` was `m+m+3` and it has been incremented by 1, making it `m+m+4`. All other variables remain unchanged.
