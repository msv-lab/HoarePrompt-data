Postcondition: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `r` is a list containing the single integer `t`, `n` and `m` are not assigned values, `y1` remains unchanged from its post-initialization state, `x1` is `x1 + a`, `x2` is `x2 - a`, `a` is `y2 - 1` if `y1` was originally `>= y2`, or `m - y2` if `y1` was originally `< y2`, `b` is an odd positive integer equal to `x2 - x1` before the modification, and either `x2 <= x1` or `x1 < 1` or `x2 > n` holds true.**
