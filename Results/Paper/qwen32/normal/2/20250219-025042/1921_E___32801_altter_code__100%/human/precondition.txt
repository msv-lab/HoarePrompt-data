t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each of the following t lines contains six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and the initial positions (x_a, y_a) and (x_b, y_b) are distinct. The sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
