The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Alice'`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. Therefore, the value to be printed is explicitly given and does not require any computation or interpretation based on the other variables.

Here's the breakdown:
- The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'Alice'`.
- None of the variables (`t`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `y1`, `x1`, `x2`, `a`, `b`, `y2`, `c`) affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
