The given code snippet assigns the value of `m - y1` to the variable `a`. Since `m`, `y1`, and `a` are the only variables affected by this line of code, and their values depend on the initial conditions provided, we need to reflect this in the output state.

Given that `m` and `y1` are not initially assigned values, we cannot determine their specific numeric values. However, we know that `a` is calculated as `m - y1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `r` is a list containing the single integer `t`; `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are not assigned values; `x2` is greater than `x1`; the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even; `y1` is not equal to `y2`; `y2` is less than `y1`; `a` is `m - y1`.**
