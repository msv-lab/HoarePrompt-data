### Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to determine the outcome of a game played on a checkered board between Alice and Bob, given their starting positions and movement rules. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - The code first checks if Bob's row (`x2`) is less than or equal to Alice's row (`x1`). If so, it concludes that the game is a draw because Alice cannot move upwards and Bob cannot move downwards, meaning they cannot meet.
   - If `x2` is greater than `x1`, the code proceeds to further checks.

2. **Odd vs Even Distance**:
   - The code then checks if the vertical distance between Alice and Bob (`x2 - x1`) is odd or even.
     - **Odd Distance**: 
       - If `y1` (Alice's column) equals `y2` (Bob's column), Alice wins because she can move directly downwards to Bob's position.
       - Otherwise, the code adjusts Alice's position by moving her one step diagonally towards Bob (either down-left or down-right).
       - After the adjustment, if `y1` equals `y2`, Alice wins.
       - If not, the code calculates the remaining vertical distance (`a`), horizontal distance (`b`), and adjusts the positions of both players accordingly.
       - Finally, it checks if Alice can win by comparing the adjusted distances and positions. If the conditions are met, Alice wins; otherwise, it's a draw.
     - **Even Distance**:
       - If `y1` equals `y2`, Bob wins because Alice cannot move to the same column as Bob in an even number of moves.
       - Otherwise, the code calculates the remaining vertical distance (`a`), horizontal distance (`b`), and adjusts the positions of both players accordingly.
       - Finally, it checks if Bob can win by comparing the adjusted distances and positions. If the conditions are met, Bob wins; otherwise, it's a draw.

### Issues in the Code:
- **Variable Naming and Initialization**: The variable names `n`, `m` are not used properly. They should represent the height (`h`) and width (`w`) of the board, respectively.
- **Incorrect Logic for Horizontal Distance**: The logic for checking the horizontal distance (`b`) and determining the winner is flawed. Specifically, the condition `b // 2 > a` is not correctly reflecting the game rules.
- **Inconsistent Return Values**: The function `func_1` does not return any meaningful value, which is fine for printing results but could be misleading if the function were expected to return a result.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the logic and variable usage, the code does not correctly implement the game rules as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
