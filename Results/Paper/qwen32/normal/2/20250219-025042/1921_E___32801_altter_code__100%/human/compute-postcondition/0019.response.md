The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Alice'`. The initial state provides details about several variables (`t`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `y1`, `y2`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.
- `r` is a list containing the single integer `t`.
- `n` and `m` are not assigned any values.
- `y1` is equal to `y2`.

Since the `print` statement only outputs the string `'Alice'`, the values of the variables `t`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `y1`, and `y2` do not influence the output.

Output: **Alice**
