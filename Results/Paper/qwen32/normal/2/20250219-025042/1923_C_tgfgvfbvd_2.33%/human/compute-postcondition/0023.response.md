Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input where `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input. Additionally, either `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s < 2 * (b - a + 1)`**
