The code reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `l`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are the two integers provided by the user input; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input.**
