Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's analyze what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer.
- `m` is greater than 0.
- `l` is a list of integers.
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `b - a + 1 > 1`.
- `s` is calculated as `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` if `a` is at least 2; otherwise, `s` is `p[b - 1]`.
- The current value of `s` satisfies `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The provided code snippet contains only a single `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. This string does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, or `s`. Therefore, regardless of the values of these variables, the output will always be the same.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
