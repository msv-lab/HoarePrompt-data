Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step-by-step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Analysis:

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `n`: An integer (value not specified).
   - `m`: An integer greater than 0 (value not specified).
   - `l`: A list of integers (contents not specified).
   - `p`: A list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
   - `c`: The sum of all elements in `l`.
   - `a` and `b`: Integers read from the input.
   - `s`: Initially set to `p[b - 1]`. If `a` is at least 2, `s` is updated to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - Either `b - a + 1` is not greater than 1, or `s` is less than 2 * (b - a + 1).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print('NO')` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of any variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.
- The presence of the conditions and the calculations involving `a`, `b`, `p`, and `s` do not affect the execution of the `print('NO')` statement. They are part of the logic that might control other parts of the program but do not influence this specific print statement.

### Final Output:
Given that the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variable values or conditions, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
