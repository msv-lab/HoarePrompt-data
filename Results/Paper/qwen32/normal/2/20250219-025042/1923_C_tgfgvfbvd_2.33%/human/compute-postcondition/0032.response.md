Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's break down the situation:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input where `m` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input.
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
- `a` and `b` are integers provided by the latest user input.
- If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`; otherwise, `s` remains `p[b - 1]`.

However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is simply:

```python
print('NO')
```

This print statement does not depend on any of the variables mentioned above. It directly outputs the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
