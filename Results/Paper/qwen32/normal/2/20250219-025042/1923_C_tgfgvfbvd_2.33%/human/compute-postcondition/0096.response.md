The code appends the value of `c` to the list `p`. Given that `c` is `x`, and `x` is the next element in the list `l`, the list `p` will now contain the integer `0` followed by the value of `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input where `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least one integer; `p` is a list containing the integers 0 and `x`; `c` is `x`; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**
