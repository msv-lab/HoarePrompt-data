Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input where `m` must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `a` and `b` are the integers provided by the latest user input; if `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`; otherwise, `s` remains `p[b - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition is met as specified in the if part; otherwise, the condition is not met as specified in the else part.**
