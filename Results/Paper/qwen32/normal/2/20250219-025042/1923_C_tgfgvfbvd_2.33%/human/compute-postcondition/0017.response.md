The code assigns the value of `p[b - 1]` to the variable `s`. This means `s` now holds the cumulative sum up to the `b`-th element of the list `l` (since list indices in Python are 0-based).

Given the initial state, the only change is the introduction of the variable `s` with its new value. All other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are the two integers provided by the user input where `m` must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `a` and `b` are the two integers provided by the user input; `s` is the cumulative sum up to the `b`-th element of the list `l`.**
