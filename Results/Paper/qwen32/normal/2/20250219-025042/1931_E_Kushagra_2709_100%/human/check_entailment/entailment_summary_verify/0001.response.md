To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's carefully analyze the problem description, the code, and the function summaries.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Anna's Turn:** Reverse the digits of a chosen number, removing leading zeros.
- **Sasha's Turn:** Concatenate two different numbers, reducing the list size by one.
- **Winning Condition:** Sasha wins if the final number is at least \(10^m\).

### Key Observations:
- **Anna's Move Impact:** Reversing a number can reduce its length if there are trailing zeros.
- **Sasha's Move Impact:** Concatenating two numbers increases the total number of digits.
- **Winning Strategy:** Sasha needs to ensure the final number has at least \(m + 1\) digits.

### Code Analysis:
The code consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1(n, m, nums)`**: Determines the winner based on the total number of digits after Anna's optimal moves.
2. **`zerocnts(num)`**: Counts the number of trailing zeros in a given number.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Calculate Total Digits (`tot`)**:
   - `tot` is the sum of the lengths of all numbers in the list.
   
2. **Count Trailing Zeros (`cntvals`)**:
   - `cntvals` is a list of trailing zero counts for each number, sorted in descending order.
   
3. **Adjust Total Digits Based on Anna's Moves**:
   - For every pair of numbers (considering Anna's optimal strategy to minimize the total number of digits), the code subtracts the number of trailing zeros from the total digits.
   - Specifically, it iterates through `cntvals` in steps of 2 and subtracts the value at each even index from `tot`.
   
4. **Determine Winner**:
   - If the adjusted total number of digits (`tot`) is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\), Sasha wins.
   - Otherwise, Anna wins.

#### Function `zerocnts`:
- This function correctly calculates the number of trailing zeros in a given number.

### Evaluation:
- **Trailing Zeros Consideration**: The code correctly identifies that Anna can minimize the total number of digits by reversing numbers with trailing zeros.
- **Total Digits Calculation**: The code accurately calculates the total number of digits initially and adjusts it based on Anna's optimal moves.
- **Winning Condition Check**: The condition `tot >= m + 1` is correct because \(10^m\) requires at least \(m + 1\) digits.

### Potential Issues:
- **Handling of Edge Cases**: The code assumes valid inputs and does not handle edge cases explicitly, but the logic seems sound for the given constraints.
- **Optimal Strategy Assumption**: The code assumes Anna will always choose to reverse numbers with the most trailing zeros first, which aligns with her goal of minimizing the total number of digits.

### Conclusion:
The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic to determine the winner based on the optimal strategies of both players. It takes into account the impact of Anna's moves (reversing numbers) and Sasha's moves (concatenating numbers) on the total number of digits in the list.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
