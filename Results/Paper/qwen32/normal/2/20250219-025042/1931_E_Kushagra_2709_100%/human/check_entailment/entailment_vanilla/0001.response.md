Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Game Mechanics:**
   - **Anna's Turn:** She reverses the digits of a chosen number. Leading zeros are removed.
   - **Sasha's Turn:** He concatenates two different numbers and inserts the concatenated number back into the list, reducing the list size by one.
   - **Winning Condition:** Sasha wins if the final number is at least \(10^m\).

2. **Objective:**
   - Determine the winner assuming both players play optimally.

### Key Observations:

- **Anna's Move Impact:** Reversing a number can potentially reduce its length if there are trailing zeros. However, reversing a number does not increase its length.
- **Sasha's Move Impact:** Concatenating two numbers increases the total number of digits in the list by the sum of the lengths of the two numbers minus one (since they are combined into one).
- **Winning Strategy:**
  - Sasha wins if he can ensure that the final number has enough digits to meet or exceed \(10^m\).
  - Anna wins if she can force the final number to have fewer digits than \(10^m\).

### Code Analysis:

The provided code attempts to determine the winner based on the total number of digits in the list after Anna's optimal moves.

#### Function `func_1`:

1. **Calculate Total Digits (`tot`):**
   - `tot` is the sum of the lengths of all numbers in the list.
   
2. **Count Trailing Zeros (`cntvals`):**
   - `cntvals` is a list where each element represents the number of trailing zeros in each number.
   - This list is sorted in descending order.
   
3. **Adjust Total Digits Based on Anna's Moves:**
   - For every pair of numbers (considering Anna's optimal strategy to minimize the total number of digits), the code subtracts the number of trailing zeros from the total digits.
   - Specifically, it iterates through `cntvals` in steps of 2 and subtracts the value at each even index from `tot`.
   
4. **Determine Winner:**
   - If the adjusted total number of digits (`tot`) is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\), Sasha wins.
   - Otherwise, Anna wins.

#### Function `zerocnts`:

- This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in a given number.

### Evaluation:

- **Trailing Zeros Consideration:** The code correctly identifies that Anna can minimize the total number of digits by reversing numbers with trailing zeros.
- **Total Digits Calculation:** The code accurately calculates the total number of digits initially and adjusts it based on Anna's optimal moves.
- **Winning Condition Check:** The condition `tot >= m + 1` is correct because \(10^m\) requires at least \(m + 1\) digits.

### Conclusion:

The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic to determine the winner based on the optimal strategies of both players. It takes into account the impact of Anna's moves (reversing numbers) and Sasha's moves (concatenating numbers) on the total number of digits in the list.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
