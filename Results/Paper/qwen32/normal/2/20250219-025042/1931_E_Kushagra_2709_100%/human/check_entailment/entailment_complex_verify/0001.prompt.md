You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, m, nums):

    tot = sum((len(val) for val in map(str, nums)))
    cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)
    for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2):
        tot -= cntvals[i]
    return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'

#Function 2:

    tot = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] != '0':
            break
        tot += 1
    return tot



- Annotated Code: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, m, nums))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of integers in the list, m is a non-negative integer representing the parameter determining when Sasha wins, and nums is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.

    tot = sum(len(val) for val in map(str, nums))
    cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)
    for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2):
        tot -= cntvals[i]
        
    #State: `tot` is the sum of the number of digits of all integers in `nums` minus the sum of `cntvals[i]` for all even indices `i` in `cntvals`.
    return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'
    #The program returns 'Sasha' if the sum of the number of digits of all integers in `nums` minus the sum of `cntvals[i]` for all even indices `i` in `cntvals` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`; otherwise, it returns 'Anna'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines the winner of a game between Sasha and Anna based on the sum of the number of digits of integers in a list, adjusted by subtracting the count of zeros at even positions in a sorted list of zero counts. If the adjusted sum is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `zerocnts` takes an integer `num` as input, where `num` is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and returns the count of trailing zeros in its decimal representation.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Game Mechanics:**
   - **Anna's Turn:** She reverses the digits of a chosen number. Leading zeros are removed.
   - **Sasha's Turn:** He concatenates two different numbers and inserts the concatenated number back into the list, reducing the list size by one.
   - **Winning Condition:** Sasha wins if the final number is at least \(10^m\).

2. **Objective:**
   - Determine the winner assuming both players play optimally.

### Key Observations:

- **Anna's Move Impact:** Reversing a number can potentially reduce its length if there are trailing zeros. However, reversing a number does not increase its length.
- **Sasha's Move Impact:** Concatenating two numbers increases the total number of digits in the list by the sum of the lengths of the two numbers minus one (since they are combined into one).
- **Winning Strategy:**
  - Sasha wins if he can ensure that the final number has enough digits to meet or exceed \(10^m\).
  - Anna wins if she can force the final number to have fewer digits than \(10^m\).

### Code Analysis:

The provided code attempts to determine the winner based on the total number of digits in the list after Anna's optimal moves.

#### Function `func_1`:

1. **Calculate Total Digits (`tot`):**
   - `tot` is the sum of the lengths of all numbers in the list.
   
2. **Count Trailing Zeros (`cntvals`):**
   - `cntvals` is a list where each element represents the number of trailing zeros in each number.
   - This list is sorted in descending order.
   
3. **Adjust Total Digits Based on Anna's Moves:**
   - For every pair of numbers (considering Anna's optimal strategy to minimize the total number of digits), the code subtracts the number of trailing zeros from the total digits.
   - Specifically, it iterates through `cntvals` in steps of 2 and subtracts the value at each even index from `tot`.
   
4. **Determine Winner:**
   - If the adjusted total number of digits (`tot`) is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\), Sasha wins.
   - Otherwise, Anna wins.

#### Function `zerocnts`:

- This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in a given number.

### Evaluation:

- **Trailing Zeros Consideration:** The code correctly identifies that Anna can minimize the total number of digits by reversing numbers with trailing zeros.
- **Total Digits Calculation:** The code accurately calculates the total number of digits initially and adjusts it based on Anna's optimal moves.
- **Winning Condition Check:** The condition `tot >= m + 1` is correct because \(10^m\) requires at least \(m + 1\) digits.

### Conclusion:

The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic to determine the winner based on the optimal strategies of both players. It takes into account the impact of Anna's moves (reversing numbers) and Sasha's moves (concatenating numbers) on the total number of digits in the list.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
