The given code snippet `elements = line.split()` splits the string stored in the variable `line` into a list of substrings based on whitespace and assigns this list to the variable `elements`. This means that `elements` will now hold the split parts of whatever string was in `line`.

Since the initial state does not specify the content of `line`, we cannot determine the exact contents of `elements`. However, we know that `elements` will be a list of strings, where each string is a substring of `line` separated by spaces.

Given the context of the problem, `line` is likely to contain a sequence of numbers (as described in the initial state), so `elements` will be a list of these numbers as strings.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; the following lines consist of pairs of lines for each test case, where the first line of each pair is an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the second line is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 through n appears in the list `a` at most 2 times; `elements` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `line` by whitespace.**
