Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 through n appears in the list a at most 2 times. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
    elements = line.split()
    print(sum(elements.count(item) // 3 for item in {*elements}))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; the following lines consist of pairs of lines for each test case, where the first line of each pair is an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the second line is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 through n appears in the list `a` at most 2 times; `elements` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `line` by whitespace.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; the following lines consist of pairs of lines for each test case, where the first line of each pair is an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the second line is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 through n appears in the list `a` at most 2 times; `elements` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `line` by whitespace; `line` holds the content of the next line to be processed in the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; the following lines consist of pairs of lines for each test case, where the first line of each pair is an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the second line is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 through n appears in the list `a` at most 2 times; `elements` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `line` by whitespace; `line` holds the content of the next line to be processed in the loop, which is two lines ahead of the current `line`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
