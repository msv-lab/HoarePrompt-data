Output State: **The list `s` contains 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' based on whether the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x` is set or not. `nalla` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. `x` remains an input integer.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all 30 iterations, the list `s` will have 30 characters, each being either '1' or '0'. These characters represent the binary digits of the input integer `x`, starting from the least significant bit (rightmost) to the most significant bit (leftmost). The variable `nalla` will have been incremented by 1, and `x` will still hold its original input value.
