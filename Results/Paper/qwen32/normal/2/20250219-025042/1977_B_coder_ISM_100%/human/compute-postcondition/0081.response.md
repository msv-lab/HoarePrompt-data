To determine what will be printed by the `print(*s)` statement, let's break down the given information:

- `t` is an integer read from the input, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable does not directly influence the contents of `s` or the print statement.
- `x` is an integer read from the input. This variable also does not directly influence the contents of `s` or the print statement.
- `s` is a list containing either 30 or 31 elements, with no consecutive `'1'` and `'-1'` elements. This means that the list `s` consists of elements that are either `'1'`, `'-1'`, or potentially other values, but importantly, it cannot have `'1'` followed immediately by `'-1'` or vice versa.
- `flag` is 0 or 1 depending on the initial conditions. This variable does not directly influence the contents of `s` or the print statement.
- `length` is either 30 or 31, matching the number of elements in `s`. This confirms the length of the list `s`.

Given these details, the `print(*s)` statement will print all elements of the list `s` separated by spaces. Since the exact elements of `s` are not specified beyond the constraints mentioned, we can describe the output in terms of those constraints.

Output: **the elements of the list `s` separated by spaces (where `s` is a list of 30 or 31 elements with no consecutive `'1'` and `'-1'` elements)**
