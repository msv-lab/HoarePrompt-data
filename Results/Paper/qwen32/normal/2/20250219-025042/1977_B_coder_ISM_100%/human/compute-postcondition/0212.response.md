The code snippet `s[i] = '-1'` assigns the string `'-1'` to the element at index `i` in the list `s`. Given the initial state, `i` is 28, so `s[28]` is set to `'-1'`. This assignment does not affect the values of `i` or `flag`.

Output State: **`i` is 28, `flag` is 0 or `s[28]` is not `'0'` (unchanged), `s[28]` is `'-1'`**
