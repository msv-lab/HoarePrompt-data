### Reasoning:

The program aims to transform the binary representation of a given integer `x` into a sequence of 1, 0, and -1 such that no two non-zero elements are adjacent. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and whether it meets the requirements:

1. **Binary Representation**: The program starts by creating a binary representation of the number `x` using a list `s` where each element corresponds to a bit in the binary form of `x`. If the `i-th` bit of `x` is set (i.e., `x & pow(2, i)` is true), it appends '1' to `s`; otherwise, it appends '0'.

2. **Transformation Rules**:
   - It iterates through the list `s` to apply the transformation rules.
   - If it encounters two consecutive '1's, it changes the first '1' to '-1' and sets a flag indicating that the next '0' should be changed to '1'.
   - If a '0' is encountered after setting the flag, it changes this '0' to '1' and resets the flag.
   - If a '1' is encountered after setting the flag, it changes this '1' to '0'.
   
3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - After the loop, if the flag is still set and the last element of `s` is '0', it changes this '0' to '1'.
   - If the flag is set and the last element of `s` is '1', it changes this '1' to '0' and appends '1' to `s`, increasing the length accordingly.
   
4. **Final Adjustment**:
   - It performs a final adjustment to ensure no two adjacent elements are '1' and '-1'. If such a pair is found, it swaps them.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the length of the transformed list and the list itself.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the transformation rules and ensures no two non-zero elements are adjacent.
- The logic for handling edge cases (when the flag is set at the end of the list) is also correct.
- The final adjustment step ensures that the output meets the problem's requirements.

Given these points, the program appears to be correctly implementing the solution as per the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
