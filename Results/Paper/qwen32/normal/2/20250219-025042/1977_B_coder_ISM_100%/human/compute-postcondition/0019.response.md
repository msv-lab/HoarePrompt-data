Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an integer read from the input; `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each either the string `'1'` or the string `'0'`, representing the binary digits of `x` starting from the least significant bit (rightmost) to the most significant bit (leftmost); `length` is 30.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all 30 iterations, `s` will contain a binary representation of the integer `x` as a list of 30 characters ('1' or '0'), with the least significant bit of `x` at the start of the list and the most significant bit at the end. The variables `t` and `length` remain unchanged.
