The list `s` originally had a length of 31. After executing `s.append('0')`, the length of `s` increases to 32. The new element `'0'` is added to the end of the list.

The value of `nalla` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, and `x` remains an input integer. The value of `i` is 30 and remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **The list `s` is either `['1', ..., '1', '0']`, `['0', ..., '1', '0']`, `['1'] + 28*'?' + ['0', '0']`, or `['0'] + 28*'?' + ['0', '0']` (with a length of 32); `nalla` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `x` remains an input integer; `i` is 30.**
