Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an integer read from the input; `s` is a list containing either the string `'1'` or the string `'0'` and now includes an additional `'1'` if `x & pow(2, i)` is true, otherwise it includes an additional `'0'`; `length` is 30; `i` is incremented by 1.**
