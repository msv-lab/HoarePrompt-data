Postcondition: **The list `s` has been modified such that any consecutive '1's will have one of them replaced with '-1' and the subsequent '1' will be flipped if `flag` is 1. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', no further modifications are made to `s` or `length`. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '1', no further modifications are made to `s` or `length`. If `flag` is 0, no further modifications are made to `s` or `length`. Additionally, if `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', an additional element '1' is appended to the end of `s`, and `length` is incremented by 1.**
