Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `x` is a new integer read from the input; `s` is a list containing either `['1', '1']`, `['0', '1']`, `['1', '0']`, or `['0', '0']` depending on the \(i\)-th bit of `x` and the previous state of `s`; `flag` is 0 or 1 depending on the initial conditions; `length` is 30; `nalla` is incremented by 1; `i` is incremented by 1. Specifically, if the \(i\)-th bit of `x` is non-zero, `s` becomes `['1', '1']` or `['0', '1']`. Otherwise, `s` becomes `['1', '0']` or `['0', '0']`.**
