The code snippet `s[i] = '0'` modifies the list `s` by setting the element at index `i` to `'0'`. Given that `i` is `i + 1` from the initial state, it implies that `i` has already been incremented by 1 before this line of code is executed.

Since `length` is greater than 1, we know that the list `s` has more than one element. The specific value of `i` is not given, but we know it has been incremented by 1, and the element at this new index `i` is set to `'0'`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`length` is greater than 1, `i` is `i + 1`, and the element at index `i` in list `s` is `'0'`.**
