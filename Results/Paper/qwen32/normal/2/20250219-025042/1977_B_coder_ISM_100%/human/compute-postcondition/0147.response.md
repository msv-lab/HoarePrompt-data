To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which includes the variables `i` and `length`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, length):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For this loop to execute, the `range(1, length)` must produce at least one value. This means that `length` must be greater than 1 because `range(1, length)` generates numbers starting from 1 up to, but not including, `length`. If `length` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute.

The variable `i` is initialized to 1 at the start of the loop, so there is no need to adjust its initial value outside the loop.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `length` is greater than 1.

State: **`length` must be greater than 1**
