To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `length`.

From the provided information:
- `length` is greater than 1.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- The condition `(s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1')` was checked, but it did not affect the values of `s[i]` or `s[i - 1]` because it was false.

Since the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `length`, we need to increment `i` by 1 to get the state at the start of the next iteration.

Given that `i` was incremented by 1 from its previous value, the new value of `i` should be `i + 1`.

No changes are needed for `length` as it remains the same throughout the iterations.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`length` is greater than 1, `i` is `i + 1`**
