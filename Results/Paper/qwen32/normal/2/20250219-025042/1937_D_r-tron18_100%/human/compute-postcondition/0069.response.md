To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given code snippet in the context of the initial state:

```python
ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
```

Given the initial state:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same.
- `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'.
- `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n]`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on certain conditions.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `el` is the second character of `s1`.
- `ol` is `totalOne`.
- `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.
- `zeroInd` is `0` if `el` is `'>'`, otherwise `2 * n`.
- `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`.
- `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`.

We need to compute the new value of `ans[i]` based on the formula provided.

Let's break down the calculation:

1. `zeroInd` is `0` if `el` is `'>'`, otherwise `2 * n`.
2. `oneInd` is computed using `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`.
3. `fi` is computed using `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`.
4. `ans[i]` is updated using the formula `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`.

Since the exact values of `func_1` are not provided, we'll keep the expressions as they are.

Therefore, the new value of `ans[i]` (which is `ans[1]` since `i` is 1) is:

\[ \text{ans}[1] = \text{zeroInd} - \text{oneInd} + n + 1 - \text{fi} \]

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[1]` which is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `el` is the second character of `s1`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is `0` if `el` is `'>'`, otherwise `2 * n`; `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`; `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`.**
