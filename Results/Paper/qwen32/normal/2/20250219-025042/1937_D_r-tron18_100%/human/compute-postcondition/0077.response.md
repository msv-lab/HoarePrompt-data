Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same.
- `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'.
- `suffZero` is `[0, 2]`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on certain conditions.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `el` is the second character of `s1`.
- `ol` is `totalOne`.
- `zr` is `1`.
- `zeroInd` is `2`.
- `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`.
- `fi` is calculated as `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol > zr`.

Code Snippet:
```python
ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
```

Impact of the Code:
- The value of `ans[i]` is updated based on the expression `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `ans[i]`. All other variables retain their initial values unless they are explicitly modified in the code snippet.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0, 2]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[1]` which is `2 - oneInd + n + 1`; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `el` is the second character of `s1`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `1`; `zeroInd` is `2`; `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`; `fi` is calculated as `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol > zr`.**
