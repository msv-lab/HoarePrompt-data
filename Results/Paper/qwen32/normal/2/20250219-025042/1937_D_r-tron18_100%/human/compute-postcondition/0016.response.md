To determine the new state after executing the given line of code, let's analyze the impact on the variables.

Given the initial state:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point.
- `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `el` is the last character of `s1` and `el` is equal to '>'.
- `ol` is equal to `totalOne`.
- `zr` is equal to `0`.
- `zeroInd` is `0`.
- `oneInd` is `value_at_0 + value_at_1` where `value_at_0` is `func_1(preOne, 0)` and `value_at_1` is `func_1(preOne, 1)`.

The line of code to execute:
```python
oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
```

Here, `func_1(preOne, 1)` returns the second element of `preOne`. Since `preOne` starts with `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, `func_1(preOne, 1)` will return `preOne[1]`.

Thus, `oneInd` is updated to `oneInd - preOne[1]`.

The output state will be:
- All other variables remain unchanged.
- `oneInd` is now `oneInd - preOne[1]`.

Since `oneInd` was initially `preOne[0] + preOne[1]`, and `preOne[0]` is `0`, `oneInd` was initially `preOne[1]`. After subtracting `preOne[1]` from `oneInd`, `oneInd` becomes `0`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `el` is the last character of `s1` and `el` is equal to '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `0`, `zeroInd` is `0`, `oneInd` is `0`.**
