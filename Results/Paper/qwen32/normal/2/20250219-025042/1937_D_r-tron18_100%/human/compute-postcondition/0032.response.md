The code snippet assigns the value of `zeroInd - oneInd` to `ans[i]`. Given the initial state, `zeroInd` is `n` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`.

Thus, `ans[i]` becomes `n - 2 * preOne[-1]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, `suffZero` is `[0, n]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is `n - 2 * preOne[-1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `el` is the last character of `s1`, and `el` is not equal to '>'; `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`; `zr` is greater than `ol`; `zeroInd` is `n`; `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`.**
