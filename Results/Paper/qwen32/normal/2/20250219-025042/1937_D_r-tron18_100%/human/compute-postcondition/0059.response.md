To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head: `i` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop starts with `i = n - 1` and decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches `-1`.
- Since we are given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust `i` to reflect the start of the next iteration.

### Current State:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same.
- `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'.
- `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n]`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on certain conditions.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `0` at the end of the previous iteration.
- `el` is the first character of `s1`.
- `ol` is `totalOne + 1` if `el` is '>', otherwise `totalOne`.
- `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', `1` if `el` is not '>'.
- `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated based on conditions.
- `fi` is calculated as `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol > zr`.

### Adjusting the State:
- Since `i` is `0` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` should be `0 - 1 = -1` if the loop were to continue. However, since the loop stops when `i` reaches `-1`, we need to consider the state just before `i` becomes `-1`.
- Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which would be the last valid iteration) should have `i` set to `1` (since the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration).

### Final State:
- All other variables remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`. `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same. `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'. `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n]`. `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on certain conditions. `n` must be greater than 0. `i` is 1. `el` is the first character of `s1`. `ol` is `totalOne + 1` if `el` is '>', otherwise `totalOne`. `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', `1` if `el` is not '>'. `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated based on conditions. `fi` is calculated as `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol > zr`.**
