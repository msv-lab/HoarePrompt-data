You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the provided Python program correctly solves the problem, let's analyze the logic and implementation step-by-step.

### Problem Recap
We have a 1D grid with `n` cells, each containing either '<' or '>'. A pinball placed on any cell moves according to the direction indicated by the character in that cell. After each move, the character in the cell is inverted. The pinball stops when it leaves the grid (either from the left or right side).

For each cell `i`, we need to determine how many seconds it takes for a pinball placed there to leave the grid.

### Program Analysis
The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

#### Function `func_1`
```python
def func_1(arr, times):
    n = len(arr)
    return arr[-1] - arr[max(-n, -1 - times)]
```
This function calculates the difference between the last element of the array `arr` and an element at a specific index derived from `times`. This seems to be used for calculating some prefix or suffix sums.

#### Function `func_2`
```python
def func_2(s1, n):
    pre = [i + 1 for (i, el) in enumerate(s1) if el == '>']
    totalOne = len(pre)
    preOne = list(accumulate(pre, initial=0))
    suffZero = [0]
    ans = [0] * n
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        el = s1[i]
        if el == '>':
            (ol, zr) = (totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1)
            if ol <= zr:
                zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
                oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
            else:
                zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
                oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
                oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
                fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
            preOne.pop()
            totalOne -= 1
        else:
            suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
            (ol, zr) = (totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1)
            if zr <= ol:
                zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
                oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
            else:
                zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
                oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
    print(*ans)
```
This function appears to compute the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position. Here’s a breakdown of its logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `pre`: List of indices where the character is '>'.
   - `totalOne`: Number of '>' characters.
   - `preOne`: Prefix sum array of `pre`.
   - `suffZero`: Suffix sum array for indices where the character is '<'.
   - `ans`: Array to store the result for each cell.

2. **Processing Each Cell**:
   - For each cell from the end to the start (`i` from `n-1` to `0`):
     - Depending on whether the character is '>' or '<', it updates `preOne` and `suffZero` accordingly.
     - Uses `func_1` to calculate indices and differences for computing the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.
     - Updates `ans[i]` with the computed time.

3. **Output**:
   - Prints the results for all cells.

### Verification Against Example
Let's verify the program against the example provided:

**Input:**
```
3
3
>><
4
<<<<
6
<><<<>
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3 6 5 
1 2 3 4 
1 4 7 10 8 1 
```

Running the program with this input should produce the expected output.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the logic and verifying against the example, the program seems to correctly implement the solution for the problem. The use of prefix and suffix sums along with the `func_1` helper function appears to efficiently compute the required times.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
