To determine the new state after executing the given line of code, we need to focus on the calculation of `fi`. The code modifies `fi` based on the function `func_1` applied to `preOne` with specific indices.

Given:
- `fi` is initially undefined (or zero, as per the context of the problem).
- `fi` is recalculated using the formula `fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`.

The variables `preOne`, `zr`, and `func_1` are already defined in the initial state. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we'll assume it computes a cumulative sum or similar operation based on the indices provided.

Let's break down the changes:
- `fi` is updated to the result of `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`.

Other variables remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on certain conditions; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `el` is the second character of `s1`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is `0` if `el` is `'>'`, otherwise `2 * n`; `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`; `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`**.

In simpler terms, the only change is that `fi` now holds the value of `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`. All other variables retain their initial values.
