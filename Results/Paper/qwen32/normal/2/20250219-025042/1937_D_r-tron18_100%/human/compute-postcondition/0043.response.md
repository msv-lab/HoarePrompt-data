To determine the new output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the existing variables:

The code snippet is:
```python
oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
```

This line modifies the value of `oneInd` by subtracting the result of `func_1(preOne, 1)` from it.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `oneInd` is initially set to `pre[0]` if `el` is '>', or `pre[0] + pre[1]` if `el` is not '>' and `pre` has at least two elements.
- `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'.

Let's denote the result of `func_1(preOne, 1)` as `result`. The new value of `oneInd` will be `oneInd - result`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `result`. However, we can express the new value of `oneInd` in terms of `result`.

Thus, the updated value of `oneInd` will be:
- `pre[0] - result` if `el` is '>'
- `(pre[0] + pre[1]) - result` if `el` is not '>' and `pre` has at least two elements

All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on certain conditions; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `0`; `el` is the first character of `s1`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', `1` if `el` is not '>'; `zeroInd` is `0` if `el` is '>', `2 * n` if `el` is not '>'; `oneInd` is `pre[0] - result` if `el` is '>', or `(pre[0] + pre[1]) - result` if `el` is not '>' and `pre` has at least two elements.**
