The function `func_2` takes a string `s1` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>' and calculates a list of integers based on the positions and counts of these characters. The resulting list `ans` is printed, where each element is derived from specific conditions related to the indices of '>' and '<' characters in the string.
