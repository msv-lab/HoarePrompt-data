The code initializes a list `ans` with `n` zeros. This operation does not affect the values of `s1`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, or `suffZero`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`; `preOne` is a list where the first element is 0 and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point; `suffZero` is a list containing the single element 0; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.**
