Postcondition: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`. `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same. `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'. `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n]`. `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on the following conditions: if `el` is '>' and `ol <= zr`, `ans[n-1]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`; if `el` is '>' and `ol > zr`, `ans[n-1]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`; if `el` is not '>' and `zr <= ol`, `ans[n-1]` is `2n - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + 1`; if `el` is not '>' and `zr > ol`, `ans[n-1]` is `n - 2 * preOne[-1]`. `n` must be greater than 0. `i` is `0`. `el` is the first character of `s1`. `ol` is `totalOne + 1` if `el` is '>', otherwise `totalOne`. `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', `1` if `el` is not '>'. `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated based on the conditions provided in the if and else parts. `fi` is calculated as `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol > zr`.**
