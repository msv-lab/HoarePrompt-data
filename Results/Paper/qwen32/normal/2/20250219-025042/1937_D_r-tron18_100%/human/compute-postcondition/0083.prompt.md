Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`; `preOne` is a list where the first element is 0 and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point; `suffZero` is a list containing the single element 0; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    el = s1[i]
    if el == '>':
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if ol <= zr:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
            oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
            oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
            fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
        preOne.pop()
        totalOne -= 1
    else:
        suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if zr <= ol:
            zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
            oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same, `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>', `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on the conditions: if `el` is '>' and `ol <= zr`, `ans[n-1]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`; if `el` is '>' and `ol > zr`, `ans[n-1]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`; if `el` is not '>' and `zr <= ol`, `ans[n-1]` is `2n - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + 1`; if `el` is not '>' and `zr > ol`, `ans[n-1]` is `n - 2 * preOne[-1]`. `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `el` is the last character of `s1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`. `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same. `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'. `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n]`. `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on the following conditions: if `el` is '>' and `ol <= zr`, `ans[n-1]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`; if `el` is '>' and `ol > zr`, `ans[n-1]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`; if `el` is not '>' and `zr <= ol`, `ans[n-1]` is `2n - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + 1`; if `el` is not '>' and `zr > ol`, `ans[n-1]` is `n - 2 * preOne[-1]`. `n` must be greater than 0. `i` is `0`. `el` is the first character of `s1`. `ol` is `totalOne + 1` if `el` is '>', otherwise `totalOne`. `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', `1` if `el` is not '>'. `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated based on the conditions provided in the if and else parts. `fi` is calculated as `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol > zr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[1]` which is calculated based on certain conditions. Specifically, if `el` is '>', and `ol <= zr`, then `ans[1]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`; otherwise, `ans[1]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. If `el` is not '>', `suffZero` is `[0, 2]`; `zr` is `1`; `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated based on conditions; if `zr <= ol`, `ans[1]` is set to `2 - oneInd + n + 1` and `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`. Otherwise, `ans[1]` is set to `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1) - 2 * preOne[-1]` and `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`. `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `el` is the second character of `s1`; `ol` is `totalOne + 1` if `el` is '>', otherwise `totalOne`; `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', `1` if `el` is not '>'; `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated based on conditions; `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol > zr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
