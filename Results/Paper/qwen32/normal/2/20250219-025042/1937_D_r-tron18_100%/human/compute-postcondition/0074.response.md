The code snippet updates the values of `ol` and `zr`. Specifically:

- `ol` is set to the value of `totalOne`.
- `zr` is set to the length of `suffZero` minus 1.

Given the initial state, `totalOne` is already defined as the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same. The length of `suffZero` is 2, so `zr` becomes `2 - 1 = 1`.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `ol` is now `totalOne`.
- `zr` is now `1`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0, 2]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on certain conditions; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `el` is the second character of `s1`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `1`; `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated based on conditions; `fi` is calculated as `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol > zr`.**
