The code snippet appends a new value to the `suffZero` list. Specifically, it adds the last element of `suffZero` plus `i` plus 1. Given that `i` is initialized to `0`, the new value being appended to `suffZero` is simply the last element of `suffZero` plus 1.

Since `i` is `0`, the operation `suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)` simplifies to `suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + 1)`. 

If `el` is '>', `suffZero` initially contains only the element `[0]`. After the operation, `suffZero` becomes `[0, 1]`.

If `el` is not '>', `suffZero` initially contains `[0, n]`. After the operation, `suffZero` becomes `[0, n, n+1]`.

No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same, `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>', `suffZero` is `[0, 1]` if `el` is '>', otherwise `[0, n, n+1]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on the conditions: if `el` is '>' and `ol <= zr`, `ans[n-1]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`; if `el` is '>' and `ol > zr`, `ans[n-1]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`; if `el` is not '>' and `zr <= ol`, `ans[n-1]` is `2n - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + 1`; if `el` is not '>' and `zr > ol`, `ans[n-1]` is `n - 2 * preOne[-1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `0`, `el` is the first character of `s1`.**
