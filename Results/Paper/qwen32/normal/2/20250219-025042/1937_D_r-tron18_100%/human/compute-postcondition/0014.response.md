The given code snippet calculates `zeroInd` by doubling the last element of the `suffZero` list. Since `suffZero` initially contains only one element, which is `0`, `zeroInd` will be `2 * 0`, resulting in `0`.

No other variables are modified in this snippet. Therefore, the output state remains the same for all other variables.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `el` is the last character of `s1`, and `el` is equal to '>'; `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `0`. Additionally, `ol` is greater than `zr`; `zeroInd` is `0`.**
