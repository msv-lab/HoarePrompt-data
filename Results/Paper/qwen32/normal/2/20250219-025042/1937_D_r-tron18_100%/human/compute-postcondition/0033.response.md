Postcondition: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, `suffZero` is `[0, n]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined as follows: if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, `ans[i]` is `2n - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + 1`; otherwise, `ans[i]` is `n - 2 * preOne[-1]`. `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `el` is the last character of `s1`, and `el` is not equal to '>'; `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`; `zr` is 1; `zeroInd` is `n`; `oneInd` is either `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, or `2 * preOne[-1]` otherwise.**
