Postcondition: **a is a list of k distinct integers where 1 <= k <= 100 and the integers are in strictly increasing order with each integer being between 1 and 100 inclusive. b is a list of q integers where 1 <= q <= 100 and each integer in b is between 1 and 100 inclusive. The list a is not less than or equal to the list b, meaning there exists at least one index i such that a[i] > b[i].**
