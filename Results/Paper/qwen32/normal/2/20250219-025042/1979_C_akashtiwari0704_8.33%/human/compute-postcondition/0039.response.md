Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `bets` is the input integer, `a` is the list of integers read from the input, `prod` is 1, `sumo` is the sum of all `prod // a[i]` for `i` from 0 to `bets-1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the program does not change `ans`. Otherwise, `ans` is a string containing the string representation of each element in `a` from `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]`, each followed by a space, `T` is `T + 1`**

Explanation: The value of `prod` has been reset to 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
