The code snippet appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the variable `ans`. Given that `bets` must be greater than 0, this condition remains unchanged. The only variable affected by the code is `ans`, which now includes the new string.

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0; `ans` is updated to include `str(a[i]) + ' '`**
