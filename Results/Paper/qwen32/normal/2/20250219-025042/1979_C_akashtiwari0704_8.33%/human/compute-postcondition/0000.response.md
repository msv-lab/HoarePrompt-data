`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`n`, `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n`) remain unchanged as they have not been assigned any values yet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` are integers such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for each i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
