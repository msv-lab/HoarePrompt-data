The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` increments the value of `sumo` by the integer value of `a[i]`. Given the initial state, `sumo` was 0, and now it will be updated to `sumo + int(a[i])`.

The other variables (`prod`, `ans`, `T`, `bets`) remain unchanged by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of `a`; `sumo` is `sumo + int(a[i])`; `ans` is a string containing the string representation of each element in `a` from `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]` with spaces added based on the condition `sumo < prod`; `T` is incremented by `bets`; `bets` must be greater than 0; `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`.**
