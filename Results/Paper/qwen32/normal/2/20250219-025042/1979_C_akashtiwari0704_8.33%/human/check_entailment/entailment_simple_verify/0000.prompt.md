You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The core issue lies in the logic used to determine the bets. The program calculates the product of all multipliers and then divides this product by each individual multiplier to determine the bets. This approach does not guarantee that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes will be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Let's analyze why this approach fails:

1. **Product Calculation**: The program calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`). For large values of `n` and `k_i`, this product can become extremely large, exceeding the constraint of `1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9`.

2. **Bet Calculation**: Each bet is calculated as `prod // a[i]`. This ensures that the sum of all bets is equal to `prod`, which is not necessarily less than `k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

3. **Comparison**: The program checks if `sumo >= prod`. Since `sumo` is equal to `prod`, this condition will always be true, leading to the program incorrectly outputting `-1` for many valid cases.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

```
1
3
2 2 2
```

The program will calculate `prod` as `2 * 2 * 2 = 8`. The bets will be `8 // 2 = 4` for each outcome, resulting in a total bet of `4 + 4 + 4 = 12`, which is not less than `2 * 4 = 8` for any outcome. Therefore, the program will output `-1`, which is incorrect.

A correct approach would involve finding a set of bets that satisfy the condition `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`. One simple strategy is to set `x_i = 1` for all `i` and check if the condition holds. If not, incrementally adjust the bets to ensure the condition is met.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        bets = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        # Try setting all bets to 1
        bets_list = [1] * bets
        total_bets = sum(bets_list)
        
        # Check if the condition is satisfied
        valid = True
        for i in range(bets):
            if total_bets >= a[i] * bets_list[i]:
                valid = False
                break
        
        if not valid:
            # If not, try setting each bet to a higher value
            bets_list = [a[i] - 1 for i in range(bets)]
            total_bets = sum(bets_list)
        
        # Output the bets
        ans = ' '.join(map(str, bets_list))
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected program sets each bet to `k_i - 1` to ensure that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.
