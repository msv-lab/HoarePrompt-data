Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to distribute the coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for each possible winning outcome. Formally, if `x_i` is the bet on the `i-th` outcome and `k_i` is the multiplier for that outcome, then the sum of all `x_i` should be less than `k_i * x_i` for every `i`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_i`.

2. **Calculating Product:**
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers `prod = k_1 * k_2 * ... * k_n`.

3. **Calculating Bets:**
   - For each outcome `i`, it calculates the bet `x_i` as `prod // k_i`. This means that `x_i` is the product of all multipliers except `k_i`.
   - It also keeps a running total of these bets in `sumo`.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - It checks if `sumo` (total bet) is less than `prod`. If `sumo` is not less than `prod`, it prints `-1` indicating that no valid distribution is possible.
   - If `sumo` is less than `prod`, it prints the calculated bets.

### Correctness Check:
- **Feasibility Condition:** The condition `sumo < prod` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for each possible winning outcome because `prod // k_i` is the maximum possible bet for the `i-th` outcome such that `sumo < prod` holds true for all `i`.
- **Bet Calculation:** The bet `x_i = prod // k_i` ensures that the amount received for the `i-th` winning outcome is `k_i * x_i = prod`, which is indeed greater than `sumo` since `sumo < prod`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets for each outcome and checks if a valid distribution is possible. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
