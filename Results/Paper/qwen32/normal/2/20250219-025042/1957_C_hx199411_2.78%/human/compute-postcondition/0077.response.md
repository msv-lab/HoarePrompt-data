The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `m`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `m`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `m` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4, and `m` must still be at least 4 for the loop to continue.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is such that `n - num` is at least 3; `k` is the second integer from the input; `num` is the sum of `k` increments, each being either 1 or 2; `m` is at least 4; `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[3]` which is 7; `i` is 4**
