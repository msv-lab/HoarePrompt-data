Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the equality of `c` and `r` over `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, no further action is taken. If `m` is 1, no further action is taken. Otherwise, `dp[m]` is the final value computed by the loop, where `m` is greater than 2.**
