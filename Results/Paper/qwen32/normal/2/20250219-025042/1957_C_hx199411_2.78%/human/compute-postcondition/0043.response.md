The loop condition is `while t:`, which means the loop will continue as long as `t` is not zero. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `t` is not zero.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we need to adjust `t` so that it remains non-zero.

Since the loop head only involves the variable `t`, we should ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq n\), `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the equality of `c` and `r` over `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, no further action is taken. If `m` is 1, no further action is taken. Otherwise, `dp[m]` is the final value computed by the loop, where `m` is greater than 2.**
