The code snippet `num += 2` increments the value of `num` by 2. Given the initial conditions, `num` is initially set to 2 if `c` equals `r`, and 3 if `c` does not equal `r`. After the increment, `num` will be 4 if `c` equals `r`, and 5 if `c` does not equal `r`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is `n`, `c` is the first integer from the new input, `r` is the second integer from the new input, `i` is `i + 2`, `num` is 4 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 5.**
