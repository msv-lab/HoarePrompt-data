The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `k`. Since the loop iterates over `range(k)`, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented again, and `k` remains unchanged.

Given that `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, `i` should now be `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration. The value of `k` does not change.
