The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `c` and `r`. This means the values of `c` and `r` will be updated based on the new input, while the other variables remain unchanged unless they depend on `c` or `r`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `k` is greater than or equal to 1
- `m` is `n`
- `c` is the first integer from the new input
- `r` is the second integer from the new input
- If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2
- `i` is `i + 1`

After executing the code snippet:
- `c` and `r` are reassigned to the new values from the input.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `num`, `i`) are not directly modified by this code snippet, so their values remain as described in the initial state, except for `num` and `i` which depend on the new values of `c` and `r`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is `n`, `c` is the first integer from the new input, `r` is the second integer from the new input, `num` is 1 if `c` equals `r` otherwise `num` is 2, `i` is `i + 1`**.
