Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input, which are assigned to `n` and `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code snippet provided.
