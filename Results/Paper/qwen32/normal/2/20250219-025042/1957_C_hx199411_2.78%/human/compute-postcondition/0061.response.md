The value of `num` is incremented by 1. Initially, `num` is 2 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 3. After the increment, `num` becomes 3 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` becomes 4. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is `n`, `c` is the first integer from the new input, `r` is the second integer from the new input, `i` is `i + 2`, `num` is 3 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 4.**
