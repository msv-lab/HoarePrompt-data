### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the given code to see if it correctly computes the number of different final configurations of the chessboard.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Game Rules**:
   - You and the computer take turns placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard.
   - You place white rooks, and the computer places black rooks.
   - No two rooks can attack each other, meaning no two rooks can be in the same row or column.
   - If you place a rook at \((r, c)\), the computer places a rook at \((c, r)\), unless \(r = c\), in which case the computer skips its turn.

2. **Objective**:
   - Given \( k \) moves already played, determine how many different final configurations are possible after continuing the game until no more valid moves remain.

3. **Constraints**:
   - Multiple test cases.
   - Large constraints on \( n \) and the total sum of \( n \) across all test cases.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) (size of the board) and \( k \) (number of moves already played).

2. **Counting Moves**:
   - It iterates through the \( k \) moves and counts how many moves were diagonal (\( r = c \)) and non-diagonal (\( r \neq c \)).
   - Diagonal moves contribute 1 to the count (`num`), and non-diagonal moves contribute 2 (`num += 2`).

3. **Remaining Positions**:
   - `m` is calculated as \( n - \text{num} \), representing the number of positions left on the board that can still be used for rooks.

4. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - If \( m = 0 \), there are no more moves possible, so the result is 0.
   - If \( m = 1 \), there is only one way to place the last rook, so the result is 1.
   - For \( m > 1 \), the code uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to place the remaining rooks:
     - `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks in \( i \) positions.
     - The recurrence relation is \( dp[i] = dp[i-1] + (i-1) \times dp[i-2] \times 2 \), which accounts for placing a rook in one position and then placing the remaining rooks in the remaining positions, considering the mirroring rule.

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - All calculations are done modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to handle large numbers.

#### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the logic to compute the number of different final configurations of the chessboard after \( k \) moves, taking into account the constraints and rules of the game. The dynamic programming approach ensures that all possible configurations are considered efficiently.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
