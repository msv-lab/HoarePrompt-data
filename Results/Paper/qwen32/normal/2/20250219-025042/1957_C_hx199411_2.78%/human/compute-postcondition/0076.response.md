To determine the new state after executing the given line of code, we need to focus on the changes made to the `dp` list specifically at index `i`.

Given:
- `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3.
- `i` is 3.

The line of code modifies `dp[i]` as follows:
```python
dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

Substituting `i = 3` into the equation:
```python
dp[3] = (dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

We know:
- `dp[1]` is 1.
- `dp[2]` is 3.

Plugging these values in:
```python
dp[3] = (3 + (2) * 1 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
dp[3] = (3 + 4) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
dp[3] = 7 % (10 ** 9 + 7)
dp[3] = 7
```

Thus, `dp[3]` is updated to 7. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is such that `n - num` is at least 3; `k` is the second integer from the input; `num` is the sum of `k` increments, each being either 1 or 2; `m` is at least 3; `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[3]` which is 7; `i` is 3**.
