Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\); `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq n\); `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the equality of `c` and `r` over `k` iterations; `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, no further action is taken. If `m` is 1, no further action is taken. Otherwise, `dp[m]` is the final value computed by the loop, where `m` is greater than 2.**

Natural Language: The value of `t` has been decremented by 1. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `num`, and `m`) retain their initial values and conditions.
