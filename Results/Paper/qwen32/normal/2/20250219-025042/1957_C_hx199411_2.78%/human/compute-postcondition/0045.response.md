The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This means the values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input, while other variables remain unchanged unless they depend on `n` or `k`.

Given the initial state, `n` was previously defined as an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\) and `k` was defined as an integer within the range \(0 \leq k \leq n\). After executing the code snippet, `n` and `k` are reassigned to the values provided by the input.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the equality of `c` and `r` over `k` iterations; `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, no further action is taken. If `m` is 1, no further action is taken. Otherwise, `dp[m]` is the final value computed by the loop, where `m` is greater than 2.**
