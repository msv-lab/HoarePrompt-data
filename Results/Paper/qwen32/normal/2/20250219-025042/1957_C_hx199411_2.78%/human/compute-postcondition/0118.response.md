The given code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `num`, and the other elements of `dp` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified.

Given the initial state, the only change is in the value of `dp[i]`. Since the specific value of `i` is not provided, we will represent the updated state of `dp[i]` using the formula provided.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the number of iterations from the input, `m` is at least 3, `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`**.
