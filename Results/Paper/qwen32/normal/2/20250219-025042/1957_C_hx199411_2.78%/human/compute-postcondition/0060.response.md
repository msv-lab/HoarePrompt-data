The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. This means the values of `c` and `r` will be updated based on the new input.

Given the initial state, the only variables that are affected by this code are `c` and `r`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is `n`, `c` is the first integer from the new input, `r` is the second integer from the new input, `i` is `i + 2`. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is 2; otherwise, `num` is 3.**

In simpler terms, the values of `c` and `r` are updated to the new integers read from the input, while all other variables retain their previous values.
