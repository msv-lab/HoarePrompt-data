The code snippet `num += 2` increments the value of `num` by 2. Given the initial state, `num` is initially set to 1 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 2. After executing `num += 2`, if `num` was initially 1, it becomes 3; if `num` was initially 2, it becomes 4.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, `r`, `i`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `c` is the first integer from the input, `r` is the second integer from the input, `num` is 3 if `c` equals `r` otherwise `num` is 4, `i` is `i + 1` if `c` does not equal `r`.**
