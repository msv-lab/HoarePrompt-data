The code snippet `pans = []` reassigns the variable `pans` to an empty list. This means that any previous value held by `pans` is discarded and replaced with an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `mak2` is the highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), `pans` is an empty list, `mak` is the highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), `i` is `n - 1`.**
