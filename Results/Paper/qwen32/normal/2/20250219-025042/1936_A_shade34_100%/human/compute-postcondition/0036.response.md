The given code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of any variables. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all output is written to the console immediately. Since there are no changes to the variables `n` and `i`, the precondition that `n` is greater than `i + 1` remains valid.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`**.
