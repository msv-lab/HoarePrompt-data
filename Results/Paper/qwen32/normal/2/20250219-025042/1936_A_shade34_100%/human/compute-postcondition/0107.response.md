The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` has some value, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is unchanged
- `n` is greater than 0
- `mak2` is the largest `i` (1 <= `i` < `n`) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists
- `mak` is the largest `i` (1 <= `i` < `n`) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists
- `s` is the input string
- If `s` is '<', `pans` is `[i]` and `mak` is the current value of `i`. Otherwise, `pans` is a list containing the value of `i` if `s` was '=', otherwise `pans` remains an empty list

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, we need to increase `i` by 1 for the next iteration. The other variables (`t`, `mak2`, `mak`, `s`, and `pans`) are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the largest `i` (1 <= `i` < `n`) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `mak` is the largest `i` (1 <= `i` < `n`) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `s` is the input string, `pans` is unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1**
