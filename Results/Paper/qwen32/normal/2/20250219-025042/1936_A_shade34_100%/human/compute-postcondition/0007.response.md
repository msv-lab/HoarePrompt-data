The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `mak`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, which means the code would raise a `NameError` in a real execution environment. Since the task specifies to simulate the execution and not handle errors, we will assume that `i` has some value that is being assigned to `mak`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the only variable that changes is `mak`, which now holds the value of `i`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `mak` is the value of `i`**.
