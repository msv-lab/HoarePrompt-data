Postcondition: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), `mak` is 1 if `s` is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` is the highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), `i` is 1, `s` is the new input string. If `s` is `'<'`, `pans` is `[1]`. If `s` is `'='`, `pans` is `[0, 1]` if `s` was previously `'<'`, `[n - 1, 0, 1]` if `s` was previously `'<'` or `'='`, otherwise `pans` is `[1]`. If `s` is not `'<'` or `'='`, `pans` remains `[0]` if `s` is `'<'`, `[n - 1, 0]` if `s` is `'<'` or `'='`, otherwise `pans` is an empty list.**
