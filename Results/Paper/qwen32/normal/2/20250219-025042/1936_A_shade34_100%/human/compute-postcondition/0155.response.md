The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from 1 to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `n` must be at least 2.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `mak2`, `pans`, and `mak`) are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged.

Given that `i` was the last value at the end of the previous iteration, we increment it by 1 for the next iteration. Let's assume `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration; then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be `x + 1`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can represent the new state as follows:

State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` must be at least 2, `mak2` is unchanged, `pans` is unchanged, `mak` is unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1**

If we assume `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be `x + 1`. However, without knowing `x`, we can simply state that `i` is incremented by 1.

So the final state is:

State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` must be at least 2, `mak2` is unchanged, `pans` is unchanged, `mak` is unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1**
