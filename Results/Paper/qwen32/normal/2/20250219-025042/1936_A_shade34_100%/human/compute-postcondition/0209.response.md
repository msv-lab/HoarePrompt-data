The value of `mak` is updated to the current value of `i`. Since `i` is `n`, `mak` now equals `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `mak2` is the highest `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), `mak` is `n`, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was either `'<'` or `'='` and must have at least `n+1` elements, `i` is `n`**.
