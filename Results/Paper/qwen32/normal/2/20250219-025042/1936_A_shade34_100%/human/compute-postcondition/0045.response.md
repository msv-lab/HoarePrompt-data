The given code snippet includes a call to `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream. This operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program. Therefore, the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than `i + 2`
- `i` is `i + 1` (This seems to be a misstatement since `i` cannot be both a variable and an expression simultaneously. Assuming it means `i` is incremented by 1.)

After the code execution, the only change is that `i` is incremented by 1, as per the second part of the initial state description.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
