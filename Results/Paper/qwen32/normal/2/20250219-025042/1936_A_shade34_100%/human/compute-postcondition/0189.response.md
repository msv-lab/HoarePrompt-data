The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. The value of `n` remains the same as it determines the total number of iterations.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), `mak` is the highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), `i` is 1, and `s` is the new input string. If `s` is `'<'`, then `pans` is `[0]`. If `s` is `'<'` or `'='`, then `pans` is `[n - 1, 0]`. Otherwise, `pans` is an empty list.**
