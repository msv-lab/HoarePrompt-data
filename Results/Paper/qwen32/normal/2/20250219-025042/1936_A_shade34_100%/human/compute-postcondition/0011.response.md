The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of any variables in the program. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the standard output immediately. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is `t`, `i` is 3**.
