To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is greater than 1, and `n` is assigned the value of `t`.
- The loop condition is `for i in range(1, n)`, meaning `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

From the loop, we know that `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

Since `n` is assigned the value of `t` and does not change within the loop, `n` remains the same.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `i` is `i_prev + 1`
- `n` is `t`

However, since we don't have the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration (`i_prev`), we can only express it in terms of `i` from the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

To make it more concrete, if we assume `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be `x + 1`.

For example, if `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be 3.

So, the final state can be written as:
State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is `t`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**. 

If we need a specific example, let's assume `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration:
State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is `t`, `i` is 3**.
