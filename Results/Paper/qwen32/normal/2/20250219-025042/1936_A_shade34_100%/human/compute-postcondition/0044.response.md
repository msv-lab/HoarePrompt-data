To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than `i + 2`
- `i` is updated to `i + 1`

### Variables in the Print Statement:
- `mak`: This variable is not defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown.
- `mak2`: This variable is also not defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown.
- `i`: This variable is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

### Analysis:
- Since `mak` and `mak2` are not defined in the initial state, their values cannot be determined from the given information. Therefore, they will be represented as `mak` and `mak2` in the output.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was initially `x`, it will now be `x + 1`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `mak` and `mak2` are undefined, we can only describe their presence in the output. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Output: **? mak mak2 i mak2 (where mak and mak2 are undefined variables, and i is incremented by 1 from its previous value)**
