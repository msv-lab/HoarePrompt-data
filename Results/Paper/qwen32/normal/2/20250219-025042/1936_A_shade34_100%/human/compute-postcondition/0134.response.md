To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State Analysis:
- `t` and `n` are mentioned but their specific values are not provided.
- `mak2` is defined as the largest index `i` (where `1 <= i < n`) for which the input was `<`, or `0` if no such `i` exists.
- `pans` is a list that contains at least two elements.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`).

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

#### Breakdown of the Print Statement:
1. `'?'`: This is a literal string that will be printed as is.
2. `pans[mak]`: This refers to the element at index `mak` in the list `pans`. Since `mak` is defined as the largest `i` where the input was `<`, or `0` if no such `i` exists, this will print the element at that specific index.
3. `pans[mak]`: This is the same as the previous item; it will print the same element again.
4. `pans[i]`: This refers to the element at index `i` in the list `pans`. Since `i` is incremented by 1, this will print the element at the new index `i`.
5. `pans[i]`: This is the same as the previous item; it will print the same element again.

### Output Description:
Given the above analysis, the output will consist of:
- A literal question mark `'?'`.
- The element at index `mak` in the list `pans`, printed twice.
- The element at the new index `i` in the list `pans`, printed twice.

Since the exact values of `mak`, `i`, and the contents of `pans` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]] (where mak is the largest index i (1 <= i < n) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such i exists, and i is incremented by 1)**
