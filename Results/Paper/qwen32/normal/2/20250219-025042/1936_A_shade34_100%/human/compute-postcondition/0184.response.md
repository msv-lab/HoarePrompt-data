The code snippet assigns the current value of `i` to `mak`. Given that `i` is initialized to 0, `mak` will now also be 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), `pans` is `[n - 1]` if `s` is equal to `'<'` or `'='`, otherwise `pans` is an empty list, `mak` is 0, `i` is 0, and `s` is the new input string.**
