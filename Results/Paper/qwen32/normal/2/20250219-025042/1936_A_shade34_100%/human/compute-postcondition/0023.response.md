To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement includes several variables: `mak`, `mak2`, and `i`. However, none of these variables are mentioned in the initial state provided. Therefore, we do not have explicit values for `mak`, `mak2`, or `i`.

Since the initial state does not provide any information about the values of `mak`, `mak2`, or `i`, we cannot determine their specific values. Thus, the output will include these variables as they are, without any specific values.

### Output:
Output: **? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] (where mak, mak2, and i are variables whose values are not specified in the initial state)**

However, since the question asks for the most precise description possible based on the given information, and the variables are not defined, we can simply state the variables as they appear in the print statement.

### Final Output:
Output: **? mak mak2 i mak2**
