Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variables and Their Definitions:**
   - `t`: Unchanged (no specific value provided).
   - `n`: Unchanged (no specific value provided).
   - `mak2`: The highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such `i` exists).
   - `mak`: 
     - If the input was `'>'`, `mak` is set to `n`.
     - Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.
   - `pans`: A list of all indices `i` where the input was either `'<'` or `'='` and must have at least `n+1` elements.
   - `i`: Set to 1.

### Print Statement Analysis:

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

We need to determine the values of `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]`.

- **`mak` Value:**
  - If the input was `'>'`, `mak` is `n`.
  - Otherwise, `mak` is 0.

- **`i` Value:**
  - `i` is explicitly set to 1.

- **`pans` List:**
  - `pans` contains indices `i` where the input was either `'<'` or `'='`.
  - It must have at least `n+1` elements.

### Determining the Values:

- **`pans[mak]`:**
  - If `mak` is `n` (input was `'>'`), `pans[n]` will be the `n`-th element of `pans`.
  - If `mak` is 0 (input was not `'>'`), `pans[0]` will be the first element of `pans`.

- **`pans[i]`:**
  - Since `i` is 1, `pans[1]` will be the second element of `pans`.

### Final Output Description:

Given the above analysis, the output will be:
- `'?'` (a literal question mark),
- `pans[mak]` (which depends on whether `mak` is `n` or 0),
- `pans[mak]` (repeated),
- `pans[1]` (the second element of `pans`),
- `pans[1]` (repeated).

Since we don't have the exact values of `mak` and the contents of `pans`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[1] pans[1] (where mak is n if the input was '>', otherwise 0, and pans is a list of indices where the input was '<' or '=')**
