The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to the variable `mak`. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `i`. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific value of `mak` after the assignment. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `s` is a string input by the user, and the current value of `s` is `<`; `mak` is equal to `i`.**
