The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. Given that `i` is `n - 1`, `mak` will now hold the value `n - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` must be greater than 0, `mak2` is the highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), `pans` is an empty list, `mak` is `n - 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `s` is the input string, and `s` equals `'<'`.**
