Given the code snippet `mak = i`, the variable `mak` is being assigned the value of `i`. Since the initial state specifies that `mak` is the largest `i` (1 <= i < n) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, and the current value of `s` is '<', it implies that `i` is the current index where the character '<' is found. Therefore, after executing `mak = i`, `mak` will hold the value of `i`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, `pans`, `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` must be greater than 0, `mak2` is the largest i (1 <= i < n) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such i exists, `pans` is an empty list, `mak` is the current value of `i`, `s` is the input string, and the current value of `s` is '<'**.
