To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` is mentioned as unchanged, but it is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
- `n` is specified to be greater than 0.
- `mak2` is described as the highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists).
- `pans` is an empty list, but it is also not used in the print statement.
- `mak` is described similarly to `mak2` as the highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists).
- `i` is explicitly set to `n - 1`.

Given these descriptions, let's break down the print statement:

```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

- `'?'` is a literal string that will be printed as is.
- `mak` is the highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists).
- `mak2` is the same as `mak` based on the description.
- `i` is `n - 1`.

Since `mak` and `mak2` are described identically, they will have the same value. The exact value of `mak` (and thus `mak2`) depends on the specific input values that were processed before this point in the code, but we know it will either be the highest index where the input was `<` or 0 if no such index exists.

The value of `i` is directly given as `n - 1`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [mak] [mak] [n - 1] [mak] (where mak is the highest i for which the input was < or 0 if no such i exists, and n is a value greater than 0)**
