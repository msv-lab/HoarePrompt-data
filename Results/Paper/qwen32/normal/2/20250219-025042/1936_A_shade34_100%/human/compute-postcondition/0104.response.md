The code snippet `pans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. Since `pans` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `pans` will contain one element, which is the value of `i`.

Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `n`, `mak2`, `mak`, and `s` remain unchanged. The only change is to `pans`, which now includes the value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` must be greater than 0, `mak2` is the largest i (1 <= i < n) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such i exists, `pans` is a list containing the value of `i`, `mak` is the largest i (1 <= i < n) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such i exists, `s` is the input string, `s` is equal to '='**.
