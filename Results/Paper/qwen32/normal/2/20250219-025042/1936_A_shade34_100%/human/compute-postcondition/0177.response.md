The code snippet appends the current value of `i` to the list `pans`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` must be greater than 0, `mak2` is the highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), `pans` is a list containing `[n - 1]`, `mak` is the highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), `i` is `n - 1`, `s` is the input string, `s` is not equal to `'<'`, and `s` is equal to `'='`**.

This means that `pans` now contains one element, which is `n - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
