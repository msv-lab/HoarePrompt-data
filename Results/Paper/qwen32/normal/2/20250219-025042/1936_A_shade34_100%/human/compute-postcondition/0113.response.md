Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the largest `i` (1 <= `i` < `n`) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `mak` is the largest `i` (1 <= `i` < `n`) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `s` is the new input string, `pans` now includes the current value of `i`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

In simpler terms, the variable `pans` now contains the current value of `i`, and `i` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
