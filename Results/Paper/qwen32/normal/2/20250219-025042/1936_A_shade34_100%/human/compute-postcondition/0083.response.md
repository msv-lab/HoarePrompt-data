To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is unchanged (its value is not specified, so it doesn't affect the print statement).
- `n` is greater than 1 (its exact value is not specified, but it's irrelevant for this print statement).
- `mak2` is unchanged (its value is not specified, so it doesn't affect the print statement).
- `pans` is unchanged (its value is not specified, so it doesn't affect the print statement).
- `mak` is either 0 or `i` depending on whether the input is not '<' or is '<', respectively.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (this means `i` has been increased by 1 from its previous value).

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement outputs a question mark ('?') followed by the values of `mak`, `mak` again, `i`, and `i` again.
- Since `mak` can be either 0 or `i` (depending on the input), we need to consider both possibilities:
  - If the input is not '<', then `mak` is 0.
  - If the input is '<', then `mak` is `i`.

- Regardless of the value of `mak`, the print statement will output `mak` twice and `i` twice.

### Final Output:
Given the conditions:
- If the input is not '<', `mak` is 0, and the output will be `? 0 0 i i`.
- If the input is '<', `mak` is `i`, and the output will be `? i i i i`.

Since we don't know the exact input, we describe the output in terms of the possible values of `mak` and `i`.

Output: **? mak mak i i (where mak is either 0 or i depending on the input, and i is the incremented value of i)**
