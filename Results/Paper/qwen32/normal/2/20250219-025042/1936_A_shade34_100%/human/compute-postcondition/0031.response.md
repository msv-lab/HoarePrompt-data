The code snippet provided appends the variable `i` to the list `pans`. However, the initial state does not specify the existence or current state of `pans` or `i`. Given the context, we can infer that `pans` is likely a list and `i` is some variable that holds a value.

Since the initial state specifies that `s` is a string input by the user, `s` is not equal to '<', and `s` is equal to '=', these conditions remain unchanged. The only change is that `i` is appended to `pans`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `s` is a string input by the user, `s` is not equal to '<', and `s` is equal to '='; `pans` has `i` appended to it.**
