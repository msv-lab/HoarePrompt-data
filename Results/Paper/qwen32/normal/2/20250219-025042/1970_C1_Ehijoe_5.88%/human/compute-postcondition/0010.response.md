Postcondition: **`n` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n representing the initial positions of the stone for each round. `tree` is an empty deque. `empty` is False. `i` is 0. `u` and `v` are the integers read from the input. Additionally, `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`.**
