Postcondition: **`n` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n representing the initial positions of the stone for each round. `empty` is False. `i` is 1. `u` and `v` are the integers read from the input. If `empty` is True, `tree` now includes the values `u` and `v`. If `empty` is False, and `v` equals the first element of `tree`, `tree` has `u` as its first element followed by the previous elements of the tree. Otherwise, if `v` equals the last element of `tree`, `tree` includes the value `u`. If `u` equals the first element of `tree`, `v` is appended to the left of `tree`. If `u` equals the last element of `tree`, `v` is appended to `tree`.**
