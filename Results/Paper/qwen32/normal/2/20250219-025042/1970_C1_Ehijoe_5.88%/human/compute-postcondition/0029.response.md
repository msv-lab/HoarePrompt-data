The code snippet `tree.append(v)` adds the value of `v` to the end of the list `tree`. 

Given the initial state, `tree` already includes the value `u`. After executing the code, `tree` will include both `u` and `v`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n representing the initial positions of the stone for each round. `empty` is False. `i` is 1. `u` and `v` are the integers read from the input. `tree` now includes the values `u` and `v`.**
