The code snippet `tree.appendleft(u)` adds the value of `u` to the left end of the `tree` list. This means that the first element of the `tree` list will now be `u`.

Given the initial state, `n`, `t`, the tree structure, the positions of the stones, and the boolean `empty` remain unchanged. The variable `i` also remains unchanged. The only change is to the `tree` list, where `u` is added to its beginning.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n representing the initial positions of the stone for each round. `empty` is False. `i` is 1. `u` and `v` are the integers read from the input. `tree` has `u` as its first element followed by the previous elements of the tree.**
