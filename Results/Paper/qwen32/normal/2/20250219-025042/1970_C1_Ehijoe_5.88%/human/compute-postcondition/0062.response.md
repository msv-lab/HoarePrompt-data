Postcondition: **`n` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by a deque containing a sequence of node IDs from one leaf to the other leaf of the tree, and `empty` is False; `start` is an integer read from input; `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`; `moves` is a list containing `[min(1, idx), min(1, n - idx - 1)]`. At least one of the elements in `moves` is odd if the if condition is met, otherwise both elements in `moves` are even numbers.**
