### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Inputs:**
   - `n`: Number of children.
   - `m`: Number of pairs of friends.
   - `k`: Number of excursions.
   - `friendships`: List of tuples `(a, b, f)` where `a` and `b` are friends with an initial friendship value `f`.

2. **Objective:**
   - Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - The expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where `p` and `q` are coprime integers.
   - Output \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

#### Analysis of the Provided Program:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the cumulative sum of `(f * (k * (k + 1) // 2)) % MOD` for all tuples in `friendships`.
   - The term `k * (k + 1) // 2` represents the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is the expected sum of friendship values for a single pair of friends over `k` excursions.
   - The result is taken modulo `MOD` to ensure it fits within the required constraints.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and prints the result.

#### Correctness Check:
- The program correctly calculates the expected sum of friendship values for each pair of friends over `k` excursions using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
- The result is accumulated for all pairs of friends and taken modulo `MOD`.
- The program handles multiple test cases as required.

However, there is a critical issue with the calculation:
- The formula `k * (k + 1) // 2` assumes that each pair of friends will be chosen exactly once per excursion, which is incorrect.
- The correct approach involves calculating the probability of choosing each pair and adjusting the expected value accordingly.

Given the provided example outputs and the logic in the code, it is clear that the program does not correctly account for the probability of choosing each pair of friends. The formula used (`k * (k + 1) // 2`) is incorrect for this problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem due to the incorrect formula used for calculating the expected sum of friendship values.

**Correctness: False**
