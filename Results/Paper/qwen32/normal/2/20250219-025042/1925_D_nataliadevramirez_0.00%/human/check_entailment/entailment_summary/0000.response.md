### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.
2. **Constraints**:
   - There are `n` children.
   - There are `m` pairs of friends with their respective friendship values.
   - The teacher chooses `k` pairs of children randomly for excursions.
   - If a chosen pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for subsequent excursions.
   - The output should be the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all chosen pairs, expressed as `p * q^-1 mod (10^9 + 7)`.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - This function takes `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` as input.
  - It iterates through each friendship, calculates the contribution of that friendship to the total sum, and accumulates it.
  - The contribution of each friendship `(a, b, f)` is calculated as `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`. This formula represents the sum of the first `k` natural numbers multiplied by the initial friendship value `f`.
  - The result is returned modulo `MOD`.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of friendships.
  - It calls `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result.

#### Issues with the Code:
- **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**:
  - The provided code calculates the total sum of friendship values assuming that every friendship pair is chosen exactly `k` times, which is incorrect.
  - The correct approach involves calculating the probability of each friendship pair being chosen in any given excursion and then using this probability to compute the expected value.
  - The probability of choosing a specific pair `(a, b)` out of all possible pairs is `1 / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`.
  - The expected contribution of a friendship `(a, b, f)` to the total sum over `k` excursions is `f * k * (1 / (n * (n - 1) / 2)) * (1 + 2 + ... + k)`, which simplifies to `f * k * (k + 1) / 2 * (1 / (n * (n - 1) / 2))`.
  - This needs to be summed up for all friendships and then taken modulo `MOD`.

Given the above analysis, the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly calculate the expected value as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not accurately compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values over the excursions.

**Correctness: False**
