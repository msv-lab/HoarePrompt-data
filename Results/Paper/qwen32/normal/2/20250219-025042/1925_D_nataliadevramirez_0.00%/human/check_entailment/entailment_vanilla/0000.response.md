Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
2. **Friendship Value Dynamics**:
   - Initially, each pair of friends has a certain friendship value.
   - Each time a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1.
   - The friendship value of non-friend pairs remains 0.
3. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - For each friend pair `(a, b)` with initial friendship value `f`, the expected contribution to the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions needs to be calculated.
   - The probability of choosing any specific pair `(a, b)` in one excursion is `1 / C(n, 2)`, where `C(n, 2)` is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n`.
   - Over `k` excursions, the expected number of times a specific pair `(a, b)` is chosen is `k / C(n, 2)`.
   - The expected contribution of a specific pair `(a, b)` to the total sum can be derived from the expected number of times it is chosen and the increase in its friendship value.

### Provided Solution Analysis:
The provided solution consists of two functions:
1. **func_1(n, m, k, friendships)**:
   - This function calculates the result for a single test case.
   - It iterates over each friendship and adds the contribution of each friendship to the result.
   - The contribution of each friendship is calculated as `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`.
     - This formula seems incorrect because it does not account for the probability of choosing a specific pair and the increase in friendship value due to previous choices.
2. **func_2()**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the result.

### Correctness Evaluation:
The key issue with the provided solution is the incorrect calculation of the expected contribution of each friendship. The formula `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` does not correctly model the expected value considering the probability of choosing each pair and the dynamic increase in friendship values.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the probability of choosing each pair `(a, b)` in one excursion, which is `1 / C(n, 2)`.
2. Calculate the expected number of times each pair is chosen over `k` excursions, which is `k / C(n, 2)`.
3. Calculate the expected contribution of each friendship to the total sum, taking into account the increase in friendship value due to previous choices.
4. Sum up the contributions of all friendships to get the final expected value.
5. Convert the final expected value to the required format `p * q^-1 % (10^9 + 7)`.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
