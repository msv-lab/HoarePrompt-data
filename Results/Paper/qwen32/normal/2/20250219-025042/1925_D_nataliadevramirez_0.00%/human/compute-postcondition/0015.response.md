To determine the output of the given Python code snippet, we need to carefully analyze the initial state provided and the context of the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `n`: An integer read from input.
- `m`: An integer read from input.
- `k`: An integer read from input.
- `friendships`: A list of `m` sublists, where each sublist contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, `f_i`.
- `t`: An integer that must be greater than or equal to 1 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `result`: The value returned by the function `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(result)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(result)` statement will output the value returned by the function `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`. Since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `result`. However, we can describe it precisely based on the given information.

### Explanation:
The `result` variable holds the return value of the function `func_1`, which takes four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`. Without knowing the implementation details of `func_1`, we can only describe `result` as the output of this function call with the specified inputs.

### Final Output:
Output: **result (where result is the value returned by func_1(n, m, k, friendships))**
