The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` (which is a conventional way to indicate that the loop variable is not used). However, the loop's continuation depends on the variable `t`. Since `t` is the number of iterations the loop should perform, it needs to be decremented at the start of each new iteration to ensure the loop continues until `t` reaches zero.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be decremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists where each sublist contains three integers a_i, b_i, f_i representing a pair of friends and their friendship value such that a_i != b_i, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9; `t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, friendships); `t` is decremented by 1**.

Since `t` is the only variable affecting the loop's continuation and it needs to be decremented, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists where each sublist contains three integers a_i, b_i, f_i representing a pair of friends and their friendship value such that a_i != b_i, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9; `t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**.
