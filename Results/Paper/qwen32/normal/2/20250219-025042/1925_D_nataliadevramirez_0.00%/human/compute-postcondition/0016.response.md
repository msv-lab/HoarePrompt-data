Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the total number of test cases that have been processed, which is now 0 since all iterations have finished. `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` are the values from the last iteration of the loop. `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)` from the last iteration.**

In simpler terms, after all the iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0 because the loop has processed all the test cases. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` will retain the values from the last test case processed. The variable `result` will hold the output from the last call to `func_1` with those values.
