### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the provided solution and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions. The expected value should consider the probability of choosing each pair and the dynamic increase in friendship values.

#### Provided Solution Analysis:
The provided solution consists of two functions:
1. **func_1(n, m, k, friendships)**:
   - Iterates over each friendship and adds the contribution of each friendship to the result.
   - The contribution of each friendship is calculated as `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`.

2. **func_2()**:
   - Handles multiple test cases.
   - Reads the input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the result.

#### Annotations:
The annotations describe the state of the program before and after key operations. They confirm that the function `func_1` calculates the cumulative sum of `(f * (k * (k + 1) // 2)) % MOD` for all tuples in `friendships`.

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Probability of Choosing a Pair**:
   - The probability of choosing any specific pair `(a, b)` in one excursion is `1 / C(n, 2)`, where `C(n, 2) = n * (n - 1) / 2`.
   - Over `k` excursions, the expected number of times a specific pair `(a, b)` is chosen is `k / C(n, 2)`.

2. **Expected Contribution of Each Friendship**:
   - The expected contribution of a specific pair `(a, b)` with initial friendship value `f` is not simply `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2)`.
   - Instead, it should consider the probability of choosing the pair and the increase in friendship value due to previous choices.

3. **Dynamic Increase in Friendship Values**:
   - The formula `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2)` does not account for the fact that the friendship value increases dynamically with each choice.
   - The correct approach involves calculating the expected number of times each pair is chosen and the resulting increase in friendship values.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the probability of choosing each pair `(a, b)` in one excursion, which is `1 / C(n, 2)`.
2. Calculate the expected number of times each pair is chosen over `k` excursions, which is `k / C(n, 2)`.
3. Calculate the expected contribution of each friendship to the total sum, taking into account the increase in friendship value due to previous choices.
4. Sum up the contributions of all friendships to get the final expected value.
5. Convert the final expected value to the required format `p * q^-1 % (10^9 + 7)`.

#### Evaluation of the Provided Solution:
Given the analysis, the formula `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2)` used in the provided solution is incorrect. It does not account for the probability of choosing each pair and the dynamic increase in friendship values.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided solution is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
