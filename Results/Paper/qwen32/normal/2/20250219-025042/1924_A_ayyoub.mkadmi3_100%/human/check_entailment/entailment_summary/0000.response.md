### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its logic against the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **Check Subsequences**: For each test case, we need to verify if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets appear as subsequences in the given string `s`.
2. **Output**: 
   - Print "YES" if all such strings are subsequences.
   - Otherwise, print "NO" followed by one example of a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It takes the string `s`, integers `k` and `n`.
   - It initializes an alphabet set containing the first `k` lowercase letters.
   - Iterates through `s` and updates the alphabet set by removing characters found in `s`.
   - Constructs `s1` by appending characters from `s` and `s2` by appending the last character when the alphabet set is reduced to one element.
   - Returns a tuple: `(len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` and checks the returned boolean value.
   - If the boolean is `False`, it tries to construct a non-subsequence string by finding a character not in `s1` and appending it to `s2` until the required length `n` is achieved.
   - Prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

#### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Logic for Checking Subsequences**:
  - The function `func_1` does not correctly check if all possible subsequences of length `n` exist in `s`. It only checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, which is insufficient.
  - The logic for constructing `s2` and the final non-subsequence string is flawed. It doesn't ensure that the constructed string is indeed a non-subsequence.
- **Lack of Comprehensive Check**:
  - The program does not systematically check all possible combinations of length `n` strings against `s` to determine if they are subsequences.

#### Conclusion:
Given the issues outlined above, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to accurately determine if all possible subsequences of length `n` exist in `s` and does not properly generate a non-subsequence string when necessary.

### Correctness: **False**
