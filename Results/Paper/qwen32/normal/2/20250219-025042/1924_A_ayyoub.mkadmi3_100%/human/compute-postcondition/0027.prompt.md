Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 26, the length of `s` is a positive integer `m` such that 1 <= `m` <= 1000, `s1` is an empty string, `s2` is an empty string, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i in alphabet:
        if len(alphabet) != 1:
            alphabet.remove(i)
        else:
            s2 += i
            alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
        s1 += i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 26, the length of `s` is a positive integer `m` such that 1 <= `m` <= 1000, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If `i` is in `alphabet`, then `s1` is a string containing the character `i`, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets except for `i` if `len(alphabet) != 1`. Otherwise, `k` is 1, `s2` is the character `i`, and `alphabet` is a set containing the character 'a'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 26, the length of `s` is a positive integer `m` such that 1 <= `m` <= 1000, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `i` is the next character in the string `s`. If `i` is in `alphabet`, and the length of `alphabet` is not equal to 1, `alphabet` excludes the character `i`. If the length of `alphabet` is 1, `s2` is a string that includes the character `i` appended to its previous value. `s1` is updated to include the character `i` appended to its previous value. If `i` is not in `alphabet`, no changes are made to `alphabet`, `s1`, or `s2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 26, the length of `s` is a positive integer `m` such that 1 <= `m` <= 1000, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets (with `i` removed if `len(alphabet) != 1`), and `i` is the next character in the string `s`. If `i` is in `alphabet`, `s1` includes the character `i` appended to its previous content.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
