The given code snippet appends the character `i` to the string `s1`. This means that the value of `s1` will now include the character `i` added to its previous content. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, `s1` was not mentioned, so we assume it was an empty string or had some initial value before this operation. After the operation, `s1` will be updated to include `i`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 26, the length of `s` is a positive integer `m` such that 1 <= `m` <= 1000, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `i` is the next character in the string `s`. If the length of `alphabet` is not equal to 1, `alphabet` excludes the character `i`. If the length of `alphabet` is 1, `s2` is a string that includes the character `i` appended to its previous value. `s1` is updated to include the character `i` appended to its previous value.**
