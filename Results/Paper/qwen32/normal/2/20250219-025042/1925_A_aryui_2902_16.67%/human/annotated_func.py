#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` does not take any parameters. The input is provided through standard input where the first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 676) denoting the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 26).
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'
    return s[:k] * n
    #The program returns a string consisting of the first `k` characters of the string `s` repeated `n` times. Given that `s` is `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'`, the returned string will be the first `k` letters of this string repeated `n` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads from standard input, where the first line contains an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`. It then returns a string consisting of the first `k` characters of the predefined string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'` repeated `n` times.
