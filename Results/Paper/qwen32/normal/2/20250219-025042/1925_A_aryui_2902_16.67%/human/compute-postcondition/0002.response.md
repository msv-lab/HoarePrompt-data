Output State: **The program returns a string consisting of the first `k` characters of the string `s` repeated `n` times. Given that `s` is `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'`, the returned string will be the first `k` letters of this string repeated `n` times.**

For example, if the last test case read was `n = 3` and `k = 5`, the output would be `'abcdeabcdeabcde'`.
