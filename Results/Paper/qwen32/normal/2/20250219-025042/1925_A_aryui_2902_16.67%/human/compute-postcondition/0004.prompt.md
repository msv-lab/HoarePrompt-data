You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` does not take any parameters. The input is provided through standard input where the first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 676) denoting the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 26).
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'
    return s[:k] * n
    #The program returns a string consisting of the first `k` characters of the string `s` repeated `n` times. Given that `s` is `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'`, the returned string will be the first `k` letters of this string repeated `n` times.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not take any direct parameters. It reads from standard input where the first line contains an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. Each subsequent line contains two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, the function returns a string consisting of the first `k` characters of the predefined string `s` (which is `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'`) repeated `n` times.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a string consisting of the first `k` characters of the string `s` repeated `n` times. Given that `s` is `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'`, the returned string will be the first `k` letters of this string repeated `n` times.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
