The given code calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `(i + 1)` and assigns it to the variable `rem`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`**
