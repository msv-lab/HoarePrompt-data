Given the code snippet and the initial state, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` is at least 2
- `a` is a sorted list of integers
- `i` is `i + 1`

Code Snippet:
```python
r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
```

From the code, we see that `r` is being assigned a new value which is the sum of `a[i]` and the integer division of `k` by `(i + 1)`. 

Since `i` is `i + 1` in the initial state, it implies that `i` has already been incremented before this line of code is executed. Therefore, we use the incremented value of `i` to access the element in the list `a`.

The value of `k` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `r` will be the sum of `a[i]` and `k // (i + 1)`.

Thus, the output state will include the updated value of `r` and retain the other conditions as they are unless explicitly changed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`**.
