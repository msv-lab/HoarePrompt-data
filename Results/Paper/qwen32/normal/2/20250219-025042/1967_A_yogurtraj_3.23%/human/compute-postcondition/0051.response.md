Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `ii` is incremented by 1, `r` is the first element of the list `a`. Additionally, `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`.**
