The code snippet provided updates the value of `y` based on the current values of `n` and `i`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `r`, `rem`) remain unchanged.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` is an integer greater than 0
- `a` is a sorted list of integers
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`
- `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`

The code modifies `y` as follows:
```
y = n - 1 - i
```

Therefore, the new value of `y` is `n - 1 - i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `i` is incremented by 1; `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`; `y` is `n - 1 - i`.**
