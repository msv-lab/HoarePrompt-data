To determine the output of the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the calculation step-by-step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). The exact value of `t` is not relevant to the print statement.
- `n`: At least 4. The exact value of `n` is not specified but it must be 4 or greater.
- `a`: A sorted list of integers. The exact values of the integers in `a` are not specified, but they are sorted in ascending order.
- `ii`: Incremented by `n - 1`. The exact value of `ii` is not directly relevant to the print statement.
- `r`: Set to `a[n - 1]`, which means `r` is the last element of the sorted list `a`.
- `rem`: Initialized to 0.
- `y`: Initialized to 0.
- `k`: Initialized to 0.

### Calculation Breakdown:
The expression inside the `print` statement is:
```python
(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y
```

Let's substitute the known values into this expression:
- `r` is `a[n - 1]`, the last element of the sorted list `a`.
- `rem` is 0.
- `y` is 0.

So the expression simplifies to:
```python
(a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 1 + 0 + 0
```
Which further simplifies to:
```python
(a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 1
```

### Explanation:
- `a[n - 1]` is the largest element in the sorted list `a` because `a` is sorted in ascending order and `n - 1` is the index of the last element.
- `(a[n - 1] - 1)` subtracts 1 from the largest element in the list.
- Multiplying the result by `n` scales this difference by `n`.
- Adding 1 to the result shifts the final value up by 1.

### Final Output:
Given the above steps, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **(a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 1 (where a[n - 1] is the last element of the sorted list `a`)**
