Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `rem` is 0; `y` is 0; `k` is reduced by the sum of (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) for all i from 0 to n - 2. If `k` is not equal to 0, then `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`. If `k` is equal to 0, then `r` remains `a[n - 2]`.**
