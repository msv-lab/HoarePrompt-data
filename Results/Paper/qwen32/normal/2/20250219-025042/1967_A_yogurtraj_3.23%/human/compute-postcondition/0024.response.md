The given code snippet modifies the value of `k` by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from it. Here's the updated state after executing the code:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.**

This means that the value of `k` has been adjusted based on the current index `i` and the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list `a`. All other variables retain their previous values.
