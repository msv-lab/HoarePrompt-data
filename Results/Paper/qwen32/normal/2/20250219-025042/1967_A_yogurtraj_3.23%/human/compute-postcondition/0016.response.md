The code snippet `r = a[i + 1]` updates the value of `r` to the next element in the sorted list `a` after the current index `i`. 

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `r`, which now holds the value of `a[i + 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `r` is `a[i + 1]`; `rem` is 0; `y` is 0; and it is not the case that `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k)`**.
