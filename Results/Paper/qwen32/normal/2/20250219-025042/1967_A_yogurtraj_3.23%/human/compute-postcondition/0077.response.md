The code assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to the variable `r`. This means `r` now holds the value of the element at index `i + 1` in the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is `a[i + 1]`.**
