The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n` is at least 4, but this condition is overwritten by the new value of `n` read from the input. The variable `k` is introduced and assigned a value from the input. The variables `t`, `a`, and `ii` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ii` is incremented by 1.**
