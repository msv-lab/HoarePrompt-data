You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description:

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have `n` different types of cards, and for each type `i`, we have `a_i` cards.
- We can buy up to `k` additional cards.
- The goal is to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

### Program Analysis:
The program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the list of card counts (`a`) and then determining how many additional cards can be used to balance the counts such that all counts are equal or nearly equal. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Sorting**: The list of card counts (`a`) is sorted.
2. **Balancing Counts**:
   - Iterate through the sorted list to determine how many additional cards are needed to make the counts up to the current maximum (`a[i]`).
   - If the required additional cards exceed `k`, calculate the new maximum count (`r`) and the remaining cards (`rem`).
   - If `k` is sufficient to balance the counts up to the last element, set the final count (`r`) accordingly.
3. **Calculating the Result**:
   - If there are remaining coins after balancing, distribute them evenly across the counts and calculate the result.
   - Otherwise, use the calculated maximum count (`r`) to compute the result.

### Potential Issues:
- **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not explicitly handle cases where `n=1` or `k=0`.
- **Final Calculation**: The final calculation `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y` might not be correct for all scenarios, especially when `k` is large or when the distribution of remaining cards affects the result.
- **Efficiency**: The program sorts the list of card counts, which is efficient enough given the constraints, but the logic for distributing remaining cards might be flawed.

### Testing the Program:
Let's consider a few test cases to see if the program works correctly:

#### Test Case 1:
```
Input:
1
1 10
1

Expected Output:
11

Actual Output:
11
```
The program correctly handles this simple case.

#### Test Case 2:
```
Input:
1
2 4
8 4

Expected Output:
15

Actual Output:
15
```
The program correctly handles this case as well.

#### Test Case 3:
```
Input:
1
3 4
6 1 8

Expected Output:
15

Actual Output:
15
```
The program correctly handles this case.

#### Test Case 4:
```
Input:
1
5 3
6 6 7 4 6

Expected Output:
22

Actual Output:
22
```
The program correctly handles this case.

#### Test Case 5:
```
Input:
1
9 7
7 6 1 7 6 2 4 3 3

Expected Output:
28

Actual Output:
28
```
The program correctly handles this case.

#### Test Case 6:
```
Input:
1
10 10
1 3 1 2 1 9 3 5 7 5

Expected Output:
32

Actual Output:
32
```
The program correctly handles this case.

#### Test Case 7:
```
Input:
1
9 8
5 8 7 5 1 3 2 9 8

Expected Output:
36

Actual Output:
36
```
The program correctly handles this case.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided test cases and the analysis of the program, it appears that the program works correctly for these scenarios. However, the logic for distributing remaining cards and calculating the final result might still be flawed for more complex cases. Since we cannot find any specific case where the program fails, we will assume it is correct based on the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program seems to correctly handle the provided test cases and the logic appears sound for the given problem constraints. However, a more thorough analysis or additional test cases might reveal potential issues.
