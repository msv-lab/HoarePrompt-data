Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is at least 4, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ii` is incremented by `n - 1`. If `k` is not 0, then `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`, `rem` is `k % n`, `y` is `n - 1`, and `k` is the reduced value after the operations. If `k` is 0, then `r` is `a[n - 1]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and `k` remains 0.**
