To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(0, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `ii` is incremented by 1.
- `y` is 0.
- `rem` is 0.
- `i` is 4.

We need to adjust the state for the next iteration. Since `i` was 4 at the end of the previous iteration, it should be incremented to 5 at the start of the next iteration, provided that `n - 1` is greater than 4 (i.e., `n` is greater than 5).

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:
- Increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 5.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 5, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ii` is incremented by 1, `y` is 0, `rem` is 0, `i` is 5**.
