The given Python code snippet simply initializes the variable `y` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `ii`, `r`, `rem`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `ii` is incremented by 1, `r` is the first element of the list `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0.**
