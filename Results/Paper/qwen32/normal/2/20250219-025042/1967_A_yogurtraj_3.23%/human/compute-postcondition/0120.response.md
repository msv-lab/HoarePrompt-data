The code assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to `r`. Given that `i` is 5, `r` will be assigned the value of `a[6]`.

Other variables remain unchanged:
- `t` is still an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` is still an integer greater than 5.
- `a` is still a sorted list of integers.
- `ii` is still incremented by 1.
- `y` is still 0.
- `rem` is still 0.
- `i` is still 5.
- `k` is still decreased by `6 * (a[6] - a[5])`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 5, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ii` is incremented by 1, `y` is 0, `rem` is 0, `i` is 5, `k` is decreased by `6 * (a[6] - a[5])`, `r` is `a[6]`.**
