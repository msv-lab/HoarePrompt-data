The code snippet provided initializes a variable `rem` to 0. This action does not affect any of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `ii`, `r`) as they are not modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `ii` is incremented by 1, `r` is the first element of the list `a`, `rem` is 0.**
