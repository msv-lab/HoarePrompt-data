Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, and `k` is set to 0, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` and `r` is `a[i + 1]`.**
