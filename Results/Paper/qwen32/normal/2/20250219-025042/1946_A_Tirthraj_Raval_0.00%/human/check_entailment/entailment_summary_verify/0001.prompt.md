You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers.

The median of an array q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_k is the number p_{\lceil
\frac{k}{2} \rceil} , where p is the array q sorted in non-decreasing order.
For example, the median of the array [9, 5, 1, 2, 6] is 5 , as in the sorted
array [1, 2, 5, 6, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 is 5
, and the median of the array [9, 2, 8, 3] is 3 , as in the sorted array [2,
3, 8, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 is 3 .

You are allowed to choose an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) and increase a_i by 1
in one operation.

Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the
median of the array.

Note that the array a may not necessarily contain distinct numbers.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations
required to increase the median of the array.

Note

In the first test case, you can apply one operation to the first number and
obtain the array [3, 2, 8] , the median of this array is 3 , as it is the
number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 3, 8] . The median of the original array [2, 2, 8] is 2 , as it is
the number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 2, 8] . Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in just one operation.

In the fourth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 2, 3 and obtain the array [6, 6, 6, 4, 5] , the median of this
array is 6 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 6, 6, 6] . The median of the original array
[5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil
= 2 in the non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 5, 5, 5] . Thus, the median
increased (6 > 5 ) in three operations. It can be shown that this is the
minimum possible number of operations.

In the fifth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 3 and obtain the array [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4] , the median of this
array is 3 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 4] . The median of the original
array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2 , as it is the number at index \lceil
\frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4] .
Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in two operations. It can be shown that
this is the minimum possible number of operations.

- Program:
def func():
    """Median of Array"""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
        res = a.count(a[p])
        print(res)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then prints the count of the median element in the sorted list `a`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Median**: 
   - For an array of odd length `n`, the median is the middle element after sorting.
   - For an array of even length `n`, the median is defined as the element at index `ceil(n/2)`. However, in the problem statement, it seems to consider the lower middle element as the median, which is the element at index `(n+1)//2 - 1` after sorting.

2. **Objective**:
   - We need to find the minimum number of operations (each operation increases one element by 1) required to increase the median of the array.

3. **Approach**:
   - Sort the array.
   - Identify the current median.
   - To increase the median, we need to ensure that the median element becomes larger than its current value. This means increasing some elements such that the new median is greater than the old median.
   - The simplest way to do this is to increase the count of the current median element until it is no longer the median. Specifically, we need to increase enough elements so that the new median is the next largest unique element in the sorted array.

### Provided Program Analysis:

The provided program does the following:
- Reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
- It sorts the array.
- It calculates the index of the median using `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`.
- It counts the occurrences of the median element in the sorted array and prints this count.

### Issues with the Provided Program:

- **Incorrect Logic for Increasing the Median**:
  - Simply counting the occurrences of the median element does not tell us how many operations are needed to increase the median.
  - To increase the median, we need to ensure that the median element is no longer the median after the operations. This requires increasing enough elements so that the new median is the next largest unique element in the sorted array.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we should:
- Sort the array.
- Identify the current median.
- Determine the next largest unique element in the sorted array.
- Calculate the number of operations required to make the current median less than this next largest element.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
