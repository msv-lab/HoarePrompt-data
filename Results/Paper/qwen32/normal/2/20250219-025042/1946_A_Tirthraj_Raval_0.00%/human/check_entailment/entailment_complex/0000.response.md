Reasoning:

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. However, the code only counts the occurrences of the current median in the sorted array and prints that count. This count has no relation to the number of operations needed to increase the median.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Sort the array.
2. Identify the current median.
3. Determine how many elements are less than or equal to the current median.
4. Increase the smallest elements until the median increases. The number of increments needed will be the answer.

Here's a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        mid = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
        current_median = a[mid]
        operations = 0
        
        # We need to make sure that the element at position `mid` is greater than the current median
        while mid < n and a[mid] <= current_median:
            operations += current_median - a[mid] + 1
            a[mid] = current_median + 1
            a.sort()  # Re-sorting after each increment is inefficient and unnecessary
            mid = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
            current_median = a[mid]
        
        # A more efficient approach would be to use a min-heap to always increment the smallest element
        # that is less than or equal to the current median.
        
        print(operations)

# The above solution is still not optimal due to repeated sorting.
# A better approach would involve using a selection algorithm to find the median
# and then counting the number of elements that need to be incremented.
```

However, the provided code does none of these steps. Instead, it simply counts the occurrences of the current median and prints that count, which is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
