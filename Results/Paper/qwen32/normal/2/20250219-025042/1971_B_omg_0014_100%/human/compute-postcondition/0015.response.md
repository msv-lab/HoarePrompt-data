Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set of unique characters from `s`. If the length of `a` is 1, then no additional changes are made. If the length of `a` is greater than 1, `b` is the string `s` sorted in ascending order, and `c` is the string `s` sorted in descending order. If `s` is equal to `b`, then `s` is already sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to `b`.**
