Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the new input string, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set of unique characters from the new `s`. If the length of `a` is 1, no additional changes are made. If the length of `a` is greater than 1, `b` is the new `s` sorted in ascending order, and `c` is the new `s` sorted in descending order. If `s` is equal to `b`, then `s` is already sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, `s` is sorted in descending order and stored in `c`. Additionally, if `s` is not equal to `b`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
