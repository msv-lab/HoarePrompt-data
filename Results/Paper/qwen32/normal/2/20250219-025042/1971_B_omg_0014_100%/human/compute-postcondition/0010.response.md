Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set of unique characters from `s`, and the length of `a` is greater than 1; `b` is the string `s` sorted in ascending order; `c` is the string `s` sorted in descending order. The current value of `s` is equal to `b`, meaning `s` is already sorted in ascending order.**
