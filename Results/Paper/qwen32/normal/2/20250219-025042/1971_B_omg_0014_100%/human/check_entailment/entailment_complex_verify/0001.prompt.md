You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the last input string, `n` is the number of iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads a string `s`. It checks if all characters in the string are the same. If they are, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and then prints the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed from `s` if `s` is not already sorted; otherwise, it prints the lexicographically largest string.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description:

### Problem Analysis
The task is to rearrange the characters of a given string `s` to form a new string `r` that is different from `s`. If it's not possible to do so, we should output "NO". Otherwise, we should output "YES" followed by one possible rearrangement of the string.

### Program Analysis
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Checking Uniqueness of Characters:**
   - It creates a set `a` from the characters of the string `s`.
   - If the length of the set `a` is 1, it means all characters in `s` are the same, and thus, it's impossible to rearrange `s` to get a different string. In this case, the program correctly outputs "NO".

3. **Generating a Different String:**
   - If the length of the set `a` is greater than 1, it means there are different characters in `s`, and thus, it's possible to rearrange `s` to get a different string.
   - The program sorts the string `s` in ascending order and stores it in `b`.
   - It also sorts the string `s` in descending order and stores it in `c`.
   - If `b` (the sorted string) is equal to `s`, it prints `c` (the reverse-sorted string), ensuring that the output string `r` is different from `s`.
   - If `b` is not equal to `s`, it simply prints `b`, which is already a different arrangement.

### Evaluation
- The program handles the case where all characters in the string are the same by outputting "NO".
- For strings with more than one unique character, it ensures that the output string `r` is different from `s` by either using the sorted version or the reverse-sorted version of the string.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It handles both possible scenarios (strings with all identical characters and strings with different characters) appropriately.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
