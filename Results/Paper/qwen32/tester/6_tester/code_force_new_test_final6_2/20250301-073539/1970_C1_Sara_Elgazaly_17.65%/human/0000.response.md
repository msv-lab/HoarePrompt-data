**Input**: 
```
3 1
2 3
3 1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a simple triangle. Starting from node 3, Ron can move the stone to node 1 or node 2. Hermione will then be forced to move it to the other node, leaving Ron with no moves. Thus, Ron wins.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
5 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a straight line. Starting from node 5, Ron can move the stone to node 4. Hermione then moves it to node 3, Ron to node 2, and Hermione to node 1, leaving Ron with no moves. Thus, Hermione wins.

2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
3
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a straight line starting from node 3. Ron can move the stone to node 2 or node 4. If Ron moves to node 2, Hermione moves to node 1, and Ron is left with no moves. If Ron moves to node 4, Hermione moves to node 5, and Ron is left with no moves. Thus, Hermione wins.

# Edge Test 9
**Input**: 
```
2 1
1 2
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a simple edge between two nodes. Starting from node 1, Ron can move the stone to node 2, leaving Hermione with no moves. Thus, Ron wins.

# Edge Test 10
**Input**: 
```
2 1
1 2
2
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a simple edge between two nodes. Starting from node 2, Ron can move the stone to node 1, leaving Hermione with no moves. Thus, Hermione wins.

# Edge Test 11
**Input**: 
```
100000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
99999 100000
100000
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a straight line with 100000 nodes. Starting from node 100000, Ron can move the stone to node 99999, Hermione to node 99998, and so on, until Hermione moves the stone to node 1, leaving Ron with no moves. Thus, Hermione wins.

# Edge Test 12
**Input**: 
```

1 2
2 3
3 4
...
99999 100000
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a straight line with 100000 nodes. Starting from node 1, Ron can move the stone to node 2, Hermione to node 3, and so on, until Ron moves the stone to node 99999, leaving Hermione with no moves. Thus, Hermione wins.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases with minimal and maximal input sizes, and different starting positions of the stone.
