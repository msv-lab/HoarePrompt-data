**Input**: 
```
1
10
piepiepie
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Explanation**: The string "piepiepie" contains multiple occurrences of "pie", and we need to remove all characters to make it beautiful.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10
mapmapmap
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Explanation**: The string "mapmapmap" contains multiple occurrences of "map", and we need to remove all characters to make it beautiful.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
11
ppiepieeee
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The string "ppiepieeee" contains "pie" and we need to remove "pie" to make it beautiful.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10
mappppie
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The string "mappppie" contains "map" and "pie", and we need to remove "map" and "pie" to make it beautiful.

# Test 14

```
1
18
mapmapmapmapmapmap
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: The string "mapmapmapmapmapmap" contains multiple occurrences of "map", and we need to remove all occurrences to make it beautiful.

# Test 15

1
i
1
e
1
m
1
a
```
**Output**: 
```
0
0
0
0
0
```
**Explanation**: Each single character string does not contain "pie" or "map", so they are already beautiful.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases with minimal and maximal input sizes, and various combinations of characters to ensure the solution is robust and handles all possible inputs correctly.
