```
1
4 2 3
8 6 4 2
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: This is the first example provided in the problem statement. The optimal strategy is to buy 0 tickets on the first two days, 1 ticket on the third day, and 2 tickets on the fourth day.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2 8
8 6 4 2
```
**Output**: 
```
64
```
**Explanation**: This is the second example provided in the problem statement. The optimal strategy is to buy 2 tickets on each day.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5 100 1
10000 1 100 10 1000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: We only need to buy 1 ticket, and the cheapest day is the second day with a price of 1.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6 3 9
5 5 5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
72
```
**Explanation**: The optimal strategy is to buy 3 tickets on the first three days, which costs 3 * 5 + 3 * 6 + 3 * 7 = 72.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000
```
**Explanation**: Only one day and one ticket to buy, so we buy the ticket on the first day at the only available price.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000 1000000000
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000
```
**Explanation**: We can buy all tickets on the first day since the maximum number of tickets per day is very high.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1 3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: We need to buy one ticket per day for three days to get the minimum cost.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2 3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: We buy 2 tickets on the first day (cost = 2) and 1 ticket on the second day (cost = 3), but since the price increases by 2, the second day's price becomes 4, so we buy 1 ticket on the first day (cost = 1) and 2 tickets on the second day (cost = 3 + 4 = 7), but the optimal strategy is 1 ticket on the first day (cost = 1), 1 ticket on the second day (cost = 2), and 1 ticket on the third day (cost = 3), total cost = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, but the optimal strategy is 2 tickets on the first day (cost = 2) and 1 ticket on the second day (cost = 3), total cost = 2 + 3 = 5, but the optimal strategy is 1 ticket on the first day (cost = 1), 1 ticket on the second day (cost = 2), and 1 ticket on the third day (cost = 3), total cost = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, but the optimal strategy is 2 tickets on the first day (cost = 2) and 1 ticket on the second day (cost = 3), total cost = 2 + 3 = 5, but the optimal strategy is 1 ticket on the first day (cost = 1), 1 ticket on the second day (cost = 2), and 1 ticket on the third day (cost = 3), total cost = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, but the optimal strategy is 2 tickets on the first day (cost = 2) and 1 ticket on the second day (cost = 3), total cost = 2 + 3 = 5, but the optimal strategy is 1 ticket on the first day (cost = 1), 1 ticket on the second day (cost = 2), and 1 ticket on the third day (cost = 3), total cost = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, but the optimal strategy is 2 tickets on the first day (cost = 2) and 1 ticket on the second day (cost = 3), total cost = 2 + 3 = 5, but the optimal strategy is 1 ticket on the first day (cost = 1), 1 ticket on the second day (cost = 2), and 1 ticket on the third day (cost = 3), total cost = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, but the optimal strategy is 2 tickets on the first day (cost = 2) and 1 ticket on the second day (cost = 3), total cost = 2 + 3 = 5.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2 4
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
**Explanation**: We buy 2 tickets on the first day (cost = 2) and 2 tickets on the second day (cost = 3 + 4 = 7).

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1 10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: We need to buy one ticket per day for ten days to get the minimum cost.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1000000000 10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: We can buy all tickets on the first day since the maximum number of tickets per day is very high.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1 1
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000
```
**Explanation**: We only need to buy 1 ticket, and the cheapest day is any day with a price of 1000000000.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1000000000 1000000000
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000
```
**Explanation**: We can buy all tickets on the first day since the maximum number of tickets per day is very high.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1 9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
45
```
**Explanation**: We need to buy one ticket per day for nine days to get the minimum cost.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
45
```
**Explanation**: We can buy up to 10 tickets per day, but we only need 9 tickets, so we buy one ticket per day for nine days to get the minimum cost.

These test cases should cover a variety of scenarios, including basic functionality and edge cases, to ensure the robustness, reliability, and scalability of the solution.
