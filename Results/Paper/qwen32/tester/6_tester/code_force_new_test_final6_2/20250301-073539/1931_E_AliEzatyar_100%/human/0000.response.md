**Input**: 
```
1
4 10
1 2007 800 1580
```

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
4 5
5000 123 30 4
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse 5000 to 5, 123 to 321, 30 to 3, and 4 to 4. Sasha can concatenate 321 and 5000 to form 3215000, which is greater than 100000.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
6 4 6 2 3 1 10 9 10 7
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: After Anna's moves, Sasha will not be able to form a number greater than 10000000000.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
6
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse 6 to 6, and since there's only one number left, Sasha cannot make a move.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
10
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse 10 to 1, and since there's only one number left, Sasha cannot make a move. However, 1 is not greater than 10, so Anna wins.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
8 9
1 2 9 10 10 2 10 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: After Anna's moves, Sasha will not be able to form a number greater than 1000000000.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
4 5
10 10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: After Anna's moves, Sasha will not be able to form a number greater than 100000.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2 0
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse either 1 to 1, and Sasha can concatenate the numbers to form 11, which is greater than 1.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
3 0
1 10 100
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
1 10
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse either 1 to 1 or 10 to 1, and Sasha can concatenate the numbers to form 11 or 101, both of which are greater than 10.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2
1 10 100 1000 10000
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse any number, and Sasha can concatenate the numbers to form a number greater than 100.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
2 9
1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse 1 to 1, and Sasha can concatenate the numbers to form 11000000000, which is greater than 1000000000. However, since the number is exactly 1000000000, Sasha does not win.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
2 10
1000000000 1

```
Anna
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse 1 to 1, and Sasha can concatenate the numbers to form 11000000000, which is greater than 10000000000. However, since the number is exactly 10000000000, Sasha does not win.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
**Explanation**: Anna can reverse either 10 to 1 or 1 to 1, and Sasha can concatenate the numbers to form 11 or 101, both of which are greater than 10.
