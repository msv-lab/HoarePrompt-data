Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
2
2
1 2
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1
4
```
**Explanation**: This is the example provided in the problem statement. The first test case results in the array becoming `[1,1]`, and the second test case results in the array becoming `[4,4,4,4,4]`.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The array already contains the same number, so no operations are needed.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operations are to first change `[3,4]` to `[3,3]` and then change the entire array to `[3,3,3,3]`.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000
```
**Explanation**: The array already contains the same number, which is the maximum possible value.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 2 3 4 5 ... 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
50000
```
**Explanation**: The maximum median achievable is the 50000th element in the sorted array, which is 50000.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to change the entire array to `[2,2,2]` by choosing the interval `[1,3]`.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 3 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to change the entire array to `[3,3,3,3]` by choosing the interval `[1,4]`.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 1 2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to change the entire array to `[2,2,2,2,2]` by choosing the interval `[1,5]`.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operations are to first change `[2,3,4]` to `[3,3,3]` and then change the entire array to `[3,3,3,3,3]`.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operations are to first change `[4,5]` to `[4,4]`, then `[3,5]` to `[4,4,4]`, and finally the entire array to `[4,4,4,4,4,4]`.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including arrays with all identical elements, arrays with increasing or decreasing elements, and arrays with a mix of elements. They also test the edge cases of the smallest and largest possible input sizes and values.
