**Input**: 
```
1
5 3
2 1 3 2 5
-3 -2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: We can strategically use the 3 bullets per second to kill all monsters before they reach the character.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
1 2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: Both monsters are moving towards the character, and we can only kill one per second, so one will reach the character.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1
-1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: We can kill the monster in one second before it reaches the character.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
2
-2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The monster will move closer each second, and we can only kill it in the second second, but it will reach the character in the first second.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10
1
-1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Even with only one monster, we can kill it in one second before it reaches the character.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The monster is moving towards the character, and we can only kill it in the second second, but it will reach the character in the first second.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
1 1 1
-3 -2 -1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: We can only kill one monster per second, and the other two will reach the character.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
1 1 1
-3 -2 -1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: With 3 bullets per second, we can kill all three monsters before they reach the character.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
1 2 3
-3 -2 -1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: We can only kill two monsters per second, and the third will reach the character.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
3 3 3
-3 -2 -1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: We can only kill two monsters per second, and the third will reach the character.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
10
10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The monster is far away, but it will reach the character in 10 seconds, and we can only kill it in the 10th second.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10
10
10
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: With 10 bullets per second, we can kill the monster in the first second before it reaches the character.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1
-1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: We can kill the monster in one second before it reaches the character.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The monster is moving towards the character, and we can only kill it in the second second, but it will reach the character in the first second.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1
-2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The monster will move closer each second, and we can only kill it in the second second, but it will reach the character in the first second.

# Test 19
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The monster is moving away, and we can only kill it in the first second, but it will not reach the character.

# Test 20
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1
-3
```
