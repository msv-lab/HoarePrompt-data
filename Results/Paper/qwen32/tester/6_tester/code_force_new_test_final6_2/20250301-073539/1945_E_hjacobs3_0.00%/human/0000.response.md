```
2
4 5
2 4
```
**Explanation**: Swapping elements at positions 4 and 5, then 2 and 4 results in the permutation [4, 5, 1, 3, 2, 6]. After binary search, p_l will be 3.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1 3
```
**Explanation**: Swapping elements at positions 1 and 3 results in the permutation [1, 2, 3]. After binary search, p_l will be 2.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The permutation is of size 1 and already sorted. The element 1 is at position 1.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1 2
```
**Explanation**: Swapping elements at positions 1 and 2 results in the permutation [1, 2]. After binary search, p_l will be 1.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The permutation is already sorted, and the element 2 is at position 2.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1 2
9 10
```
**Explanation**: Swapping elements at positions 1 and 2, then 9 and 10 results in the permutation [9, 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]. After binary search, p_l will be 10.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1 10
2 9
```
**Explanation**: Swapping elements at positions 1 and 10, then 2 and 9 results in the permutation [1, 2, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 9, 10]. After binary search, p_l will be 1.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 50000
100000 99999 ... 50001 50000 49999 ... 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1 50000
100000 50001
```
**Explanation**: Swapping elements at positions 1 and 50000, then 100000 and 50001 results in a permutation where the element 50000 is in the correct position after binary search.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
200000 100000
100000 99999 ... 1 200000 199999 ... 100001
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1 100000
200000 100001
```
**Explanation**: Swapping elements at positions 1 and 100000, then 200000 and 100001 results in a permutation where the element 100000 is in the correct position after binary search.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases with small and large inputs, and permutations that require multiple swaps to achieve the desired result.
