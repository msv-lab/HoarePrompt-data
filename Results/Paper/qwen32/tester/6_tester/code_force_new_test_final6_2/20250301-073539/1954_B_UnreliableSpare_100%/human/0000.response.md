# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
9
1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
*Comment*: Removing four elements (2s, 3s, 4s, and 5s) will result in a non-beautiful array [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
*Comment*: Removing five elements (2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, and 6s) will result in a non-beautiful array [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1].

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 ... 1 2 1 2 1 (alternating 1s and 2s)
```
**Output**: 
```
50000
```
*Comment*: An array of 100,000 alternating 1s and 2s. Removing all 2s (or 1s) will result in a non-beautiful array.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... 1 1 1 1 1 (all 1s)
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Comment*: An array of 100,000 identical elements. Removing any number of elements will still result in a beautiful array.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... 100000 99999 99998 ... 5 4 3 2 1 (strictly increasing then decreasing)
```
**Output**: 
```
99998
```
*Comment*: An array of 100,000 elements that strictly increases and then decreases. Removing all elements except the first and last will result in a non-beautiful array.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 ... 50000 50000 (pairs of identical elements)
```
**Output**: 
```
50000
```
*Comment*: An array of 100,000 elements consisting of 50,000 pairs of identical elements. Removing all second elements of each pair will result in a non-beautiful array.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 3 2 3 1 3 2 3 1 3 ... 1 3 2 3 1 (pattern of 1 3 2 3 1)
```
**Output**: 
```
40000
```
*Comment*: An array of 100,000 elements following the pattern 1 3 2 3 1. Removing all 2s and 3s will result in a non-beautiful array.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... 1 1 1 1 1 (all 1s) except one 2 in the middle
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Comment*: An array of 100,000 elements with all 1s except one 2 in the middle. Removing the 2 will result in a non-beautiful array.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 ... 1 2 1 2 1 (alternating 1s and 2s) except one 3 in the middle
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Comment*: An array of 100,000 elements with alternating 1s and 2s except one 3 in the middle. Removing the 3 will result in a non-beautiful array.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases, and large input sizes to ensure the solution is robust, reliable, and scalable.
