Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3
1 2 3
3 2 1
1 5 3
```
**Output**: 
```
STAIR
NONE
PEAK
```
**Explanation**: 
- The first test case forms a stair because 1 < 2 < 3.
- The second test case forms neither a stair nor a peak.
- The third test case forms a peak because 1 < 5 > 3.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
3
3 4 1
0 0 0
4 1 7
```
**Output**: 
```
PEAK
NONE
NONE
```
**Explanation**: 
- The first test case forms a peak because 3 < 4 > 1.
- The second test case forms neither a stair nor a peak because all digits are the same.
- The third test case forms neither a stair nor a peak because 4 > 1 but 1 < 7 does not form a peak or stair.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
3
4 5 7
2 2 2
1 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
STAIR
NONE
NONE
```
**Explanation**: 
- The first test case forms a stair because 4 < 5 < 7.
- The second test case forms neither a stair nor a peak because all digits are the same.
- The third test case forms neither a stair nor a peak because 1 < 3 but 3 > 2 does not form a peak or stair.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
9 8 0
```
**Output**: 
```
PEAK
```
**Explanation**: 
- The largest possible values for a and b that form a peak with the smallest value for c.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
0 9 0
```
**Output**: 
```
NONE
```
**Explanation**: 
- The smallest value for a and c with the largest value for b that does not form a stair or peak.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
NONE
```
**Explanation**: 
- Two identical values for a and b with a different value for c that does not form a stair or peak.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NONE
```
**Explanation**: 
- Two identical values for b and c with a different value for a that does not form a stair or peak.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1 9 1
```
**Output**: 
```
PEAK
```
**Explanation**: 
- The smallest value for a and c with the largest value for b that forms a peak.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
9 9 9
```
**Output**: 
```
NONE
```
**Explanation**: 
- All digits are the same, which does not form a stair or peak.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
NONE
```
**Explanation**: 
- The smallest value for a and c with a different value for b that does not form a stair or peak.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
9 8 9
```
**Output**: 
```
NONE
```
**Explanation**: 
- The largest value for a and c with a different value for b that does not form a stair or peak.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NONE
```
**Explanation**: 
- Two different values for a and c with the same value for b that does not form a stair or peak.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
9 0 9
```
**Output**: 
```
NONE
```
**Explanation**: 
- The largest value for a and c with the smallest value for b that does not form a stair or peak.
