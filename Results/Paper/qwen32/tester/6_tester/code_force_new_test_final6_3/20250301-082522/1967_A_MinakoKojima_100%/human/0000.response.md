Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10
1
```
**Output**: 
```
11
```
**Explanation**: We have 1 type of card with 1 card initially. We can buy 10 more cards of type 1. The final arrangement is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], which gives 11 subarrays of length 1 that are permutations of [1].

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 4
8 4
```
**Output**: 
```
15
```
**Explanation**: We have 2 types of cards with 8 and 4 cards initially. We can buy 4 more cards optimally to maximize the score. One optimal arrangement is [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2], which gives 15 subarrays of length 2 that are permutations of [1, 2].

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 4
6 1 8
```
**Output**: 
```
15
```
**Explanation**: We have 3 types of cards with 6, 1, and 8 cards initially. We can buy 4 more cards optimally to maximize the score. One optimal arrangement is [3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3], which gives 15 subarrays of length 3 that are permutations of [1, 2, 3].

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 9
7 6 2
```
**Output**: 
```
22
```
**Explanation**: We have 3 types of cards with 7, 6, and 2 cards initially. We can buy 9 more cards optimally to maximize the score. One optimal arrangement is [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3], which gives 22 subarrays of length 3 that are permutations of [1, 2, 3].
