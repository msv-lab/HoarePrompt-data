Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 0 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Alice can pick 1, then Bob picks 0, Alice picks 0, and Bob picks 1. The final array `c` is [1, 0], and MEX is 2.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice can pick 0, then Bob picks 1, Alice picks 2, and Bob picks 3. The final array `c` is [0, 2], and MEX is 1.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice can pick 1, then Bob picks 1. The final array `c` is [1], and MEX is 0.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice picks 0. The final array `c` is [0], and MEX is 1, but since Bob doesn't pick anything, the MEX of [0] is 1, but since Alice is the first to move and there's only one element, the MEX of the final array is 0.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice picks 1. The final array `c` is [1], and MEX is 0.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Alice picks 0, then Bob picks 1, Alice picks 2, Bob picks 3, and Alice picks 4. The final array `c` is [0, 2, 4], and MEX is 1.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice picks 0, then Bob picks 0, Alice picks 0, Bob picks 0, and Alice picks 0. The final array `c` is [0, 0, 0, 0], and MEX is 1, but since Bob doesn't pick the last 0, the MEX of the final array is 0.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
6
0 1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Alice picks 0, then Bob picks 1, Alice picks 2, Bob picks 3, Alice picks 4, and Bob picks 5. The final array `c` is [0, 2, 4], and MEX is 1, but since Bob doesn't pick the last 5, the MEX of the final array is 3.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
6
0 0 1 1 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Alice picks 0, then Bob picks 0, Alice picks 1, Bob picks 1, Alice picks 2, and Bob picks 2. The final array `c` is [0, 1, 2], and MEX is 3.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice and Bob keep picking 0s alternately. The final array `c` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], and MEX is 1, but since Bob doesn't pick the last 0, the MEX of the final array is 0.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: Alice picks 0, then Bob picks 1, Alice picks 2, Bob picks 3, Alice picks 4, Bob picks 5, Alice picks 6, Bob picks 7, Alice picks 8, and Bob picks 9. The final array `c` is [0, 2, 4, 6, 8], and MEX is 1, but since Bob doesn't pick the last 9, the MEX of the final array is 5.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
0 0 0 ... 0 (100000 zeros)
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice and Bob keep picking 0s alternately. The final array `c` will have 50000 zeros, and MEX is 0.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
0 1 2 ... 99999 (all distinct)
```
**Output**: 
```
50000
```
**Explanation**: Alice and Bob pick elements alternately, and the final array `c` will have 50000 elements, and MEX is 50000.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
2
2
1 1
3
0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
0
```
**Explanation**: For the first test case, Alice picks 1, Bob picks 1. The final array `c` is [1], and MEX is 0. For the second test case, Alice picks 0, Bob picks 0, Alice picks 0. The final array `c` is [0, 0], and MEX is 1, but since Bob doesn't pick the last 0, the MEX of the final array is 0.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
2
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1
```
**Explanation**: For the first test case, Alice can pick 1, then Bob picks 0, Alice picks 0, and Bob picks 1. The final array `c` is [1, 0], and MEX is 2. For the second test case, Alice picks 0, then Bob picks 1, Alice picks 2, and Bob picks 3. The final array `c` is [0, 2], and MEX is 1.
