Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
100 0 24
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Comments**: No friends, so the expected value of the sum of friendship values is 0.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 10
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
55
```
**Comments**: Only one pair of friends, so each time the pair is chosen, its friendship value increases by 1. The sum of the first 10 natural numbers is 55.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2 4
1 2 25
3 2 24
```
**Output**: 
```
40000020
```
**Comments**: Two pairs of friends. The expected value of the sum of friendship values is \(\frac{7}{9} = 777777784 \mod (10^9+7)\).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
4 3 1
1 2 1
2 3 2
3 4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Comments**: Three pairs of friends, each with different initial friendship values. Only one excursion, so the expected value is simply the average of the initial friendship values.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5 10 100000
1 2 1
1 3 2
1 4 3
1 5 4
2 3 5
2 4 6
2 5 7
3 4 8
3 5 9
4 5 10
```
**Output**: 
```
999999937
```
**Comments**: Many friends and a large number of excursions. The expected value is a fraction that needs to be reduced modulo \(10^9+7\).

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
1 2 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
500000000
```
**Comments**: One pair of friends with a very high initial friendship value. The expected value is simply the initial friendship value modulo \(10^9+7\).

```
**Comments**: All possible pairs are friends with an initial friendship value of 1. The expected value for one excursion is simply the average of the initial friendship values.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10 0 200000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Comments**: No friends, and a large number of excursions. The expected value remains 0.

1 2 1
2 3 1
3 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Comments**: All pairs are friends with an initial friendship value of 1. The expected value for one excursion is simply the average of the initial friendship values.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```

2 1 100000
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
500005000
```
**Comments**: One pair of friends with an initial friendship value of 1. The expected value is the sum of the first 100000 natural numbers divided by 100000, modulo \(10^9+7\).

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including no friends, all possible pairs as friends, a large number of excursions, and various combinations of initial friendship values.
