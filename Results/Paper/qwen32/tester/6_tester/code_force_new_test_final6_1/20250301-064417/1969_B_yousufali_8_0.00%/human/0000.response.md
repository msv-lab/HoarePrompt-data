Sure, here is a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem:

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
10
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The string "10" can be sorted by cyclically shifting the whole substring "10" to "01" with a cost of 2.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
0000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The string "0000" is already sorted, so no operations are needed.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
11000
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Explanation**: As described in the problem statement, the optimal strategy involves multiple cyclic shifts with a total cost of 9.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
101011
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: The string can be sorted by performing cyclic shifts with a total cost of 5.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
01101001
```
**Output**: 
```
11
```
**Explanation**: The string can be sorted by performing cyclic shifts with a total cost of 11.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: A single-character string is trivially sorted, so no operations are needed.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: A single-character string is trivially sorted, so no operations are needed.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: A string of all '1's is already sorted, so no operations are needed.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: A string of all '0's is already sorted, so no operations are needed.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010
```
**Output**: 
```
299
```
**Explanation**: The string alternates between '1' and '0', requiring multiple cyclic shifts with a total cost of 299.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
2
10
101
```
**Output**: 
```
2
2
```
**Explanation**: The first string "10" can be sorted with a cost of 2, and the second string "101" can be sorted with a cost of 2.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
3
01
10
001
```
**Output**: 
```
2
2
2
```
**Explanation**: The strings "01" and "10" can be sorted with a cost of 2 each, and "001" can be sorted with a cost of 2.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111110
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The string is almost sorted, with only one '0' at the end. A single cyclic shift of the last two characters is needed with a cost of 1.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
0111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The string is almost sorted, with only one '0' at the beginning. A single cyclic shift of the first two characters is needed with a cost of 1.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The string is almost sorted, with only one '1' at the beginning. A single cyclic shift of the first two characters is needed with a cost of 1.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The string is almost sorted, with only one '1' at the end. A single cyclic shift of the last two characters is needed with a cost of 1.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases, and large input sizes, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the solution.
