Sure, let's create a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The array is already sorted, so the optimal split is to put every other element in each subsequence to maximize the number of increasing pairs in each.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
8
8 2 3 1 1 7 4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: One optimal split is `s=[8,3,1]` and `t=[2,1,7,4,3]` which results in penalties `p(s)=0` and `p(t)=1`.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
3 3 3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Since all elements are the same, any split will result in no increasing pairs in either subsequence.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Single element array has no increasing pairs.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The only possible splits are `([2], [1])` and `([1], [2])` both resulting in zero penalties.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The optimal split is `([1], [2])` or `([2], [1])` resulting in a penalty of 1.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Explanation**: The array is sorted, and the optimal split is to distribute elements such that each subsequence has the maximum number of increasing pairs.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The array is sorted in reverse order, and any split will result in no increasing pairs.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 10 2 9 3 8 4 7 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: One optimal split is `s=[1,2,3,4,5]` and `t=[10,9,8,7,6]` resulting in penalties `p(s)=4` and `p(t)=0`.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 2 3 4 5 ... 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
99999
```
**Explanation**: The array is sorted, and the optimal split is to distribute elements such that each subsequence has the maximum number of increasing pairs.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
100000 99999 99998 ... 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The array is sorted in reverse order, and any split will result in no increasing pairs.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 1 1 ... 1 (100000 times)
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: All elements are the same, so any split will result in zero penalties.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 2 1 2 1 2 ... 1 2 (alternating)
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The array alternates between two values, and any split will result in zero penalties.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 3 2 4 3 5 4 6 5 7 ... 99999 100000 99999 (alternating increasing and decreasing)
```
**Output**: 
```
49999
```
**Explanation**: The array alternates between increasing and decreasing pairs, and the optimal split is to distribute elements such that each subsequence has the maximum number of increasing pairs.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
10000
1
1
1
2
1 2
2
1 2
1
1
1

1 2
...
```
**Output**: 
```
0
0
1
0
0
1
0
0
1
...
```
**Explanation**: Multiple test cases with small arrays to ensure the function handles multiple test cases efficiently.
