Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 2 3 4 5 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to set elements from index 2 to 5 to 1, costing (5-2+1) = 4 burles.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The array is already uniform, so no operation is needed.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
8
8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to set elements from index 4 to 5 to 8, costing (5-4+1) = 2 burles.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: A single-element array is already uniform.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to set either element to match the other, costing 1 burle.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to set either the first two or last two elements to match the third, costing 2 burles.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
7
4 3 2 7 1 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to set elements from index 1 to 7 to 1, costing (7-1+1) = 7 burles, but setting from index 4 to 7 to 1 is more optimal, costing (7-4+1) = 4 burles, and setting from index 1 to 3 to 1 is also optimal, costing (3-1+1) = 3 burles, and setting from index 5 to 7 to 1 is also optimal, costing (7-5+1) = 3 burles, and setting from index 1 to 2 to 1 and from index 4 to 7 to 1 is optimal, costing (2-1+1) + (7-4+1) = 1 + 4 = 5 burles, and setting from index 1 to 3 to 1 and from index 5 to 6 to 1 is optimal, costing (3-1+1) + (6-5+1) = 3 + 2 = 5 burles, and setting from index 1 to 2 to 1 and from index 5 to 6 to 1 and from index 7 to 7 to 1 is optimal, costing (2-1+1) + (6-5+1) + (7-7+1) = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 burles, and setting from index 1 to 2 to 1 and from index 4 to 5 to 1 and from index 7 to 7 to 1 is optimal, costing (2-1+1) + (5-4+1) + (7-7+1) = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 burles, and setting from index 1 to 2 to 1 and from index 4 to 6 to 1 is optimal, costing (2-1+1) + (6-4+1) = 1 + 3 = 4 burles, and setting from index 1 to 3 to 1 and from index 4 to 6 to 1 is optimal, costing (3-1+1) + (6-4+1) = 3 + 3 = 6 burles.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
9
9 9 2 9 2 5 5 5 3
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to set elements from index 3 to 9 to 9, costing (9-3+1) = 7 burles.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
2
2
1 1
3
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
0
```
**Explanation**: Both arrays are already uniform.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
2
3
1 2 3
3
3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
2
```
**Explanation**: For both arrays, the optimal operation is to set either the first two or last two elements to match the third, costing 2 burles.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
99999
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to set all elements from index 1 to 100000 to 1, costing (100000-1+1) = 100000 burles, but setting from index 2 to 100000 to 1 is more optimal, costing (100000-2+1) = 99999 burles.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The array is already uniform.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to set either element to match the other, costing 1 burle.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 100000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to set either the first two or last two elements to match the third, costing 2 burles.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
100000 100000 100000 100000 100000 100000 100000 100000 100000 100000 ... 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The array is already uniform.
