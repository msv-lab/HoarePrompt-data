Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
2
2 5 9
3 5 9
```
**Output**: 
```
9
14
```
**Explanation**: 
- For the first test case, buying two yogurts at the promotion price (9 burles) is cheaper than buying them individually (10 burles).
- For the second test case, buying two yogurts at the promotion price (9 burles) and one yogurt at the regular price (5 burles) is cheaper than buying all three individually (15 burles).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
3
4 5 10
5 5 10
6 5 10
```
**Output**: 
```
20
25
30
```
**Explanation**: 
- For the first test case, buying two yogurts at the promotion price twice (20 burles) is the best option.
- For the second test case, buying two yogurts at the promotion price twice and one yogurt at the regular price (25 burles) is the best option.
- For the third test case, buying two yogurts at the promotion price three times (30 burles) is the best option.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: 
- Since Maxim only needs one yogurt, it's cheaper to buy it at the regular price (1 burle) rather than the promotion price (2 burles).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: 
- Buying two yogurts at the promotion price (3 burles) is cheaper than buying them individually (2 burles).

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: 
- Buying two yogurts at the promotion price (3 burles) and one yogurt at the regular price (1 burle) is cheaper than buying all three individually (3 burles).

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
100 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
**Explanation**: 
- When the promotion price is not cheaper than the regular price, Maxim should buy all yogurts at the regular price.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
100 30 59
```
**Output**: 
```
1485
```
**Explanation**: 
- Maxim should buy 50 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (59 burles each pair), resulting in a total cost of 2950 burles. However, since the number of yogurts is even, he can buy all pairs at the promotion price (50 * 59 = 2950 burles).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
99 30 59
```
**Output**: 
```
1485
```
**Explanation**: 
- Maxim should buy 49 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (59 burles each pair) and one yogurt at the regular price (30 burles), resulting in a total cost of 2950 + 30 = 2980 burles.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1 30 59
```
**Output**: 
```
30
```
**Explanation**: 
- Since Maxim only needs one yogurt, it's cheaper to buy it at the regular price (30 burles) rather than the promotion price (59 burles).

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2 30 58
```
**Output**: 
```
58
```
