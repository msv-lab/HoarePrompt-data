Certainly! Below are a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios:

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
4
3
2 2 2
5
1 2 1 2 1
1
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
1
-1
3
```
**Comment**: This is the example provided in the problem statement. It covers a situation where the array is already beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements, a situation where one element can be removed to make the array non-beautiful, and a situation where multiple elements need to be removed.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Comment**: The smallest possible beautiful array that cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Comment**: The smallest possible beautiful array that can be made non-beautiful by removing one element.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 1 2 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Comment**: A beautiful array where removing one element (the middle '2') makes it non-beautiful.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Comment**: A beautiful array where removing three elements (the '2's and '3') is necessary to make it non-beautiful.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Comment**: A larger beautiful array where removing five elements is necessary to make it non-beautiful.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
9
1 2 3 4 3 2 1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Comment**: A beautiful array where removing five elements (the '2's, '3's, and '4') is necessary to make it non-beautiful.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Comment**: The smallest possible array that is trivially beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Comment**: A beautiful array where removing one element (the '3') makes it non-beautiful.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 1 1 ... 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Comment**: The maximum possible size of the array with all elements the same, which is trivially beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 2 1 2 1 2 ... 1 2 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
50000
```
**Comment**: The maximum possible size of the array with alternating elements, which requires removing half the elements to make it non-beautiful.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 2 3 4 5 6 ... 99999 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
99999
```
**Comment**: The maximum possible size of the array with all distinct elements, which requires removing all but one element to make it non-beautiful.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
10000
1
1
1
1
...
1
1
```
**Output**:
