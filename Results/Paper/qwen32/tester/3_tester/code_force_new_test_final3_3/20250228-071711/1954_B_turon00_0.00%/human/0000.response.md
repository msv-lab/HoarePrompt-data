Sure, let's create a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: The array is already composed of identical elements, so it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Removing any one of the middle elements (index 2 or 4) will make the array non-beautiful.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: The array has only one element, so it is trivially beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Removing the first three elements will make the array `[5, 3, 3, 3]`, which is not beautiful.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: The array has only two elements that are the same, so it is beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Removing the middle element will make the array `[1, 1]`, which is not beautiful.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 2 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Removing any one of the middle elements will make the array non-beautiful.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 3 2 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Removing the middle element (index 2) will make the array `[1, 3, 3, 1]`, which is not beautiful.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 2 1 2 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Removing any one of the middle elements will make the array non-beautiful.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Removing any one of the middle elements will make the array non-beautiful.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 2 1 2 1 2 ... 1 2 1 2 (alternating 1 and 2)
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Removing any one of the middle elements will make the array non-beautiful.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 1 1 ... 1 1 (all elements are 1)
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: The array is composed of identical elements, so it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 2 3 4 ... 100000 (all elements are distinct)
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: The array is not beautiful as no two adjacent elements are the same, so it is already non-beautiful.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 1 2 1 1 ... 1 1 (repeating pattern of 1 1 2 1 1)
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Removing any one of the middle elements (index 2 or 4) will make the array non-beautiful.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 2 3 4 5 ... 99998 99999 100000 (strictly increasing sequence)
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: The array is not beautiful as no two adjacent elements are the same, so it is already non-beautiful.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic functionality and edge cases, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the solution.
