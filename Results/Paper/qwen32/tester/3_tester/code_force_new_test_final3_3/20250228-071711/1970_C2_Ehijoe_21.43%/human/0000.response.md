Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
5 1
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: Ron starts on node 1, which has neighbors 2 and 3. Ron can move to either 2 or 3. If Ron moves to 2, Hermione can move to 1, and Ron will have no more moves. If Ron moves to 3, Hermione can move to 1 or 4 or 5. Ron can then move to a node that Hermione cannot counter effectively. Ron wins.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
4 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: Ron starts on node 4, which has only one neighbor, node 3. Ron moves to 3, Hermione moves to 2, Ron moves to 1, and Hermione has no more moves. Hermione wins.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
3 1
1 2
2 3
2
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: Ron starts on node 2, which has neighbors 1 and 3. Ron can move to either 1 or 3. If Ron moves to 1, Hermione can move to 2, and Ron will have no more moves. If Ron moves to 3, Hermione can move to 2, and Ron will have no more moves. However, Ron can force a win by carefully choosing his moves.

...
99999 100000
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: Ron starts on node 1, which has only one neighbor, node 2. Ron can force a win by moving to node 2 and then following a strategy that ensures Hermione cannot block him.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
100000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
99999 100000
