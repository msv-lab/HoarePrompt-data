Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
2
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4 1
1 2
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of the array is 2, so replacing the entire array with 2 results in the maximum sum of 4.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
3
1 3 9
```
**Output**: 
```
13 0
```
**Explanation**: The initial sum is already the maximum possible sum, so no operations are needed.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
**Explanation**: First, change the third element to 0, then change the third and fourth elements to 2, resulting in the maximum sum of 105.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 1
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of the array is 1, so replacing the single element with 1 results in the maximum sum of 1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2 1
1 2
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of the array is 0, but since 0 is already present, the next MEX is 2, so replacing the entire array with 2 results in the maximum sum of 4.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
18
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17
```
**Output**: 
```
153 0
```
**Explanation**: The initial sum is already the maximum possible sum, so no operations are needed.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
18
17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
153 0
```
**Explanation**: The initial sum is already the maximum possible sum, so no operations are needed.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
18
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
153 18

12 12
13 13
14 14
15 15
16 16
17 17
18 18
```
**Explanation**: Each element is replaced with its respective MEX, resulting in the maximum sum of 153.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
18
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
153 18
1 1
2 2
3 3
4 4
5 5
6 6
7 7
8 8
9 9
10 10
11 11
12 12
13 13
14 14
15 15
16 16
17 17
18 18
```
**Explanation**: Each element is replaced with its respective MEX, resulting in the maximum sum of 153.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
18
10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000
```
**Output**: 
```
153 18
1 1
2 2
3 3
4 4
5 5
6 6
7 7
8 8
9 9
10 10
11 11
12 12
13 13
14 14
15 15
16 16
17 17
18 18
```
**Explanation**: Each element is replaced with its respective MEX, resulting in the maximum sum of 153.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 1
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of the array is 0, but since 0 is already present, the next MEX is 1, so replacing the single element with 1 results in the maximum sum of 1.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring that the solution is robust, reliable, and scalable.
