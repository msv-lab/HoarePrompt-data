Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5 4
1 2 1 4 5
1 5
4 4
3 4
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
NO
YES
NO
```
**Explanation**: 
- The subarray `1 2 1 4 5` has a sum of 13. We can construct `b = 2 1 2 5 4` which meets the conditions.
- The subarray `4` has a sum of 4. It's impossible to construct `b` with a single element that is not equal to 4 and positive.
- The subarray `1 4` has a sum of 5. We can construct `b = 2 3`.
- The subarray `1 2 1` has a sum of 4. It's impossible to construct `b` with three elements that are not equal to `1 2 1` and positive.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
1 1 1
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: 
- The subarray `1 1 1` has a sum of 3. It's impossible to construct `b` with three elements that are not equal to `1` and positive.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1
2 2 2 2
1 4
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
- The subarray `2 2 2 2` has a sum of 8. We can construct `b = 1 3 1 3`.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
10
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: 
- The subarray `10` has a sum of 10. It's impossible to construct `b` with a single element that is not equal to 10 and positive.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
1 10
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
- The subarray `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10` has a sum of 55. We can construct `b` such that the sum is also 55 and all elements are different and positive.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10 3
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 5
6 10
1 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
NO
NO
```
**Explanation**: 
- Each subarray consists of all 1s. It's impossible to construct `b` with elements that are not equal to 1 and positive.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: 
- The subarray `5` has a sum of 5. It's impossible to construct `b` with a single element that is not equal to 5 and positive.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
1 10
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
- The subarray `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000` has a sum of 10000000000. We can construct `b` such that the sum is also 10000000000 and all elements are different and positive.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
- The subarray `2` has a sum of 2. We can construct `b = 1`.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
1 2 3
1 2
2 3
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
YES
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
- The subarray `1 2` has a sum of 3. We can construct `b = 2 1`.
- The subarray `2 3` has a sum of 5. We can construct `b = 1 4`.
- The subarray `1 2 3` has a sum of 6. We can construct `b = 2 1 3`.

These test cases should cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the solution is robust and handles both basic and edge cases effectively.
