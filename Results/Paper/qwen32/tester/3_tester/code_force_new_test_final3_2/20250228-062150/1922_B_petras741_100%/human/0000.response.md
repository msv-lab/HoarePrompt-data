Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The lengths of the sticks are 2, 4, and 8. No three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The only valid triangle is formed by sticks with lengths 2, 4, and 8. However, 2 + 4 is not greater than 8, so no valid triangle can be formed.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4
3 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Valid triangles are (2^3, 2^2, 2^3) and (2^3, 2^3, 2^1).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
35
```
**Explanation**: Any combination of three sticks can form a triangle since all sticks have the same length.

**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: All sticks have length 4, and any combination of three can form a triangle.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Not enough sticks to form a triangle.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The valid triangle is formed by sticks with lengths 2, 2, and 4.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: Valid triangles are (2, 4, 8), (2, 8, 16), (4, 8, 16), and (2, 4, 16).

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 1 1 1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
20
```
**Explanation**: Combinations involving the stick of length 2 and any two sticks of length 2 can form triangles.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
**Output**: 
```
120
```
**Explanation**: Multiple combinations can form valid triangles.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
3
3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: All sticks have length 8, and any combination of three can form a triangle.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
0 0 0 ... 0 (100000 zeros)
```
**Output**: 
```
1666616667
```
**Explanation**: Large number of sticks all of length 1, leading to a large number of valid triangles.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
0 1 2 ... 99999
```
**Output**: 
```
1666616665
```
**Explanation**: Large number of sticks with increasing powers of 2, leading to a large number of valid triangles.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The combination (2, 2, 8) does not form a valid triangle.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: Combinations involving the stick of length 2 and any two sticks of length 2 can form triangles.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
