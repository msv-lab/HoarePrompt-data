Sure, let's create a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem. We will cover both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.

### Basic Test Cases

**Test 1**
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 2 8
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The median of the array [2, 2, 8] is 2. By increasing the first element to 3, the median becomes 3.

**Test 2**
**Input**: 
```
1
4
7 3 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The median of the array [7, 3, 3, 1] is 3. By increasing two elements (e.g., the second and third elements to 4), the median becomes 4.

**Test 3**
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 5 5 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The median of the array [5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5. By increasing the fourth element to 5 three times, the median becomes 5, but to strictly increase it, we need to increase it to 6, which requires three operations.

**Test 4**
**Input**: 
```
1
6
2 1 2 3 1 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The median of the array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2. By increasing the second and third elements to 3, the median becomes 3.

**Test 5**
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The median of the array [1, 2] is 1. By increasing the first element to 2, the median becomes 2.

### Edge Test Cases

**Test 6**
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The median of the array [1000000000] is 1000000000. By increasing the element to 1000000001, the median becomes 1000000001.

**Test 7**
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The median of the array [1, 1] is 1. By increasing both elements to 2, the median becomes 2.

**Test 8**
**Input**: 
```
1
4
5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The median of the array [5, 5, 5, 5] is 5. By increasing three elements to 6, the median becomes 6.

**Test 9**
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 1 1 ... 1 (100000 ones)
```
**Output**: 
```
50000
```
**Explanation**: The median of the array with 100000 ones is 1. By increasing the first 50000 elements to 2, the median becomes 2.

**Test 10**
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 2 3 ... 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
50000
```
**Explanation**: The median of the array [1, 2, 3, ..., 100000] is 50000. By increasing the first 50000 elements by 1, the median becomes 50001.

**Test 11**
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
100000 99999 99998 ... 1
```
**Output**: 
```
50000
```
**Explanation**: The median of the array [100000, 99999, 99998, ..., 1] is 50001. By increasing the last 50000 elements by 1, the median becomes 50002.

**Test 12**
**Input**: 
```
10000
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
1
...
1
```
**Explanation**: Each of the 10000 test cases has an array of length 1 with a single element 1. The median is 1, and increasing it to 2 requires 1 operation.

These test cases should cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the solution is both correct and efficient.
