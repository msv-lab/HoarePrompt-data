Sure, let's create comprehensive test cases for the given problem. We'll cover both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
6 7 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: As per the example, after 7 minutes, one firework from each installation will be visible.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 4 10
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
**Explanation**: Fireworks from the first installation will be visible at [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21] and from the second at [4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24]. Maximum overlap occurs at minute 12.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
7 8 56
```
**Output**: 
```
17
```
**Explanation**: Fireworks overlap at minute 112, with 9 from the first installation and 8 from the second.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 6 78123459896
```
**Output**: 
```
28645268630
```
**Explanation**: Large numbers with significant overlap.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: Every minute, two fireworks are launched and visible, leading to an overlap of 4 fireworks.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
2000000000000000002
```
**Explanation**: Maximum possible value for `m`, leading to a large number of overlapping fireworks.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Overlap occurs at every minute, with fireworks from the first installation and alternating fireworks from the second.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000 1000000000000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Both installations launch fireworks at the same intervals, leading to overlap every `a` minutes.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Minimal overlap due to large difference in intervals.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: Overlap occurs at minutes 6, 12, 18, etc., with fireworks from both installations visible.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
12
```
**Explanation**: Overlap occurs at every 10 minutes, with fireworks from both installations visible.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
2000000000000000002
```
**Explanation**: Maximum possible value for `m`, leading to a large number of overlapping fireworks.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Minimal overlap due to large difference in intervals.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000000000000 1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Minimal overlap due to large difference in intervals and visibility duration.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000 1000000000000000000 1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Overlap occurs at every `a` minutes, with fireworks from both installations visible.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases with large numbers, and minimal overlap conditions.
