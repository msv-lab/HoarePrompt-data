Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
0
```
**Explanation**: The smallest array that has exactly 2 increasing subsequences is [0], which has the subsequences: [] and [0].

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
0 1 0
```
**Explanation**: The array [0, 1, 0] has the subsequences: [], [0], [1], [0, 1], [1, 0]. Note that [0, 0] is not valid because the elements must be strictly increasing.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
13
```
**Output**: 
```
5
2 2 3 4 2
```
**Explanation**: The array [2, 2, 3, 4, 2] has exactly 13 increasing subsequences.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
37
```
**Output**: 
```
7
-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1
```
**Explanation**: The array [-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1] has exactly 37 increasing subsequences.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: There is no array that has exactly 1 increasing subsequence because the empty subsequence is always counted.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: The number of increasing subsequences is too large to be achieved with an array of length at most 200.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
0 1
```
**Explanation**: The array [0, 1] has exactly 3 increasing subsequences: [], [0], [1], [0, 1].

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
0 2
```
**Explanation**: The array [0, 2] has exactly 4 increasing subsequences: [], [0], [2], [0, 2].

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
6
```
**Output**: 
```
3
0 1 2
```
**Explanation**: The array [0, 1, 2] has exactly 6 increasing subsequences: [], [0], [1], [2], [0, 1], [1, 2], [0, 2], [0, 1, 2].

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
7
```
**Output**: 
```
3
0 1 0
```
**Explanation**: The array [0, 1, 0] has exactly 7 increasing subsequences: [], [0], [1], [0, 1], [1, 0], [0, 0], [0, 1, 0].

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
8
```
**Output**: 
```
3
0 1 2
```
**Explanation**: The array [0, 1, 2] has exactly 8 increasing subsequences: [], [0], [1], [2], [0, 1], [1, 2], [0, 2], [0, 1, 2].

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
9
```
**Output**: 
```
3
0 1 2
```
**Explanation**: The array [0, 1, 2] has exactly 8 increasing subsequences, but we need 9. Thus, we need a different array configuration.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10
```
**Output**: 
```
3
0 1 2
```
**Explanation**: The array [0, 1, 2] has exactly 8 increasing subsequences, but we need 10. Thus, we need a different array configuration.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
11
```
**Output**: 
```
3
0 1 2
```
**Explanation**: The array [0, 1, 2] has exactly 8 increasing subsequences, but we need 11. Thus, we need a different array configuration.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
12
```
**Output**: 
```
3
0 1 2
```
**Explanation**: The array [0, 1, 2] has exactly 8 increasing subsequences, but we need 12. Thus, we need a different array configuration.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
200
```
**Output**: 
```
199
-1 -1 -1 ... -1 0 1 2 ... 197
```
**Explanation**: An array with 199 elements where the first 198 elements are -1 and the last three are 0, 1, 2. This configuration can achieve exactly 200 increasing subsequences.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: The number of increasing subsequences is too large to be achieved with an array of length at most 200.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: The number of increasing subsequences is too large to be achieved with an array of length at most 200.

# Test 19
**Input**: 
```
1
200000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: The number of increasing subsequences is too large to be achieved with an array of length at most 200.

# Test 20
