#### Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
6 4 3
1 2 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: With 6 vertices, Bessie has chosen 4 vertices (1, 2, 4, 5). We can choose 3 more vertices to maximize the number of triangles.

#### Test 4

1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
999999996
```
**Explanation**: With 1 billion vertices, Bessie has chosen 2 vertices (1, 1000000000). We can choose 999999998 more vertices to maximize the number of triangles.

#### Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 0
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
8
```
**Explanation**: With 10 vertices, Bessie has chosen all 10 vertices. No additional vertices can be chosen, but the maximum number of triangles can still be formed.

#### Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10 3 7
1 5 9
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: With 10 vertices, Bessie has chosen 3 vertices (1, 5, 9). We can choose 7 more vertices to maximize the number of triangles.

#### Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
8 4 3
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: With 8 vertices, Bessie has chosen 4 consecutive vertices (1, 2, 3, 4). We can choose 3 more vertices to maximize the number of triangles.

#### Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
8 4 3
1 3 5 7
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: With 8 vertices, Bessie has chosen 4 alternating vertices (1, 3, 5, 7). We can choose 3 more vertices to maximize the number of triangles.

#### Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
12 6 0
1 3 5 7 9 11
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: With 12 vertices, Bessie has chosen 6 alternating vertices (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11). No additional vertices can be chosen, but the maximum number of triangles can still be formed.

### Scalability Test Cases

#### Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
200000 100000 100000
1 2 3 ... 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
199998
```
**Explanation**: With 200,000 vertices, Bessie has chosen 100,000 vertices. We can choose 100,000 more vertices to maximize the number of triangles.

#### Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 500000 500000
1 2 3 ... 500000
```
