```
1
10 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: All cubes are the same, so the favorite cube will always be in the 1st position after sorting, so it will not be removed.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
42
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: There is only one cube, so it will always be removed.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2 3
2 2 1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The favorite cube can be in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th position after sorting, but it will always be removed.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The favorite cube is the smallest and will always be in the 2nd position after sorting, so it will be removed.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
5 3 1
3 3 2 3 2

**Input**: 
```
1
5 1 4
5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The favorite cube is the largest and will always be in the 1st position after sorting, but since k=n-1, it will be removed.

```
1
5 1 3
5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The favorite cube is the largest and will always be in the 1st position after sorting, but since k=n-2, it will be removed.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
5 1 2
5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
