**Input**: 
```
3
3 0
3 1
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
3
2
1
```
**Explanation**: 
- For the first test case, no bridges are destroyed, so Everule can visit all three islands.
- For the second test case, one bridge is destroyed, so Everule can visit two islands.
- For the third test case, two bridges are destroyed, so Everule can only visit island 1.

# Test 3
