Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4 5
1 2 4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: As per the example, the Kraken attacks the first ship, then the last, and so on. The first ship sinks after 1 attack, the last ship after 2 attacks, and the first ship again after 3 attacks. The fourth ship is attacked but does not sink after 4 attacks, and the second ship is attacked but does not sink after 5 attacks.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4 6
1 2 4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Similar to Test 1, but the Kraken attacks one more time, sinking the fourth ship after the 6th attack.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5 20
2 7 1 8 2
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks 20 times, sinking all ships as follows:
- First ship: 2 attacks
- Last ship: 2 attacks
- First ship: 2 attacks
- Last ship: 2 attacks
- First ship: 2 attacks
- Last ship: 2 attacks
- First ship: 2 attacks
- Last ship: 2 attacks

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks the first ship, reducing its durability to 2, and then attacks the last ship, reducing its durability to 1. No ship sinks after 2 attacks.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2 15
1 5
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks the first ship, reducing its durability to 0 after 1 attack, and then attacks the last ship, reducing its durability to 0 after 5 attacks. Both ships sink after 6 attacks.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 5
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks the only ship 5 times, but it sinks after the first attack.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks the only ship once, sinking it.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10
10
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks the only ship 10 times, sinking it after 10 attacks.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks the first ship once, reducing its durability to 0.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks the first and last ships alternately, sinking 5 ships after 10 attacks.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10 100
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks the ships 100 times, sinking all 10 ships.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10 5
10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks the first and last ships alternately, but no ship sinks after 5 attacks.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10 50
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks the ships 50 times, sinking all 10 ships.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10 9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks the first and last ships alternately, sinking 5 ships after 9 attacks.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1000000000000000
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks the ships a very large number of times, sinking all 10 ships.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases with minimal and maximal inputs, and large-scale scenarios to ensure the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.
