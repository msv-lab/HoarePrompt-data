Sure, let's create a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem. These test cases will cover both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5 3
4 1 1 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: As shown in the example, we can exchange 3 cards with the same number to get 2 cards. The optimal sequence of operations leads to 2 cards left.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10
7
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With only 1 card, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
7 2
4 2 1 100 5 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: We can repeatedly exchange pairs of cards until only 1 card is left.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
10 4
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: We can exchange 4 cards at a time, reducing the count by 1 each time. After 2 exchanges, we will have 3 cards left.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2
3 8 1 48 7
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: No two cards have the same number, so no operations can be performed, and the answer is 5.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
6 2
10 20 30 10 20 40
```
**Output**: 
```

```
**Explanation**: We can exchange pairs of cards with the same number until only 1 card is left.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
6 3
10 20 30 10 20 40
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: No three cards have the same number, so no operations can be performed, and the answer is 6.

# Test 8
**Input**:

```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: We can repeatedly exchange pairs of cards until only 1 card is left.

# Test 9

```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: We can repeatedly exchange 100 cards with the same number to get 99 cards, and so on, until only 1 card is left.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
50 5
1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 7 7 7 7 7 8 8 8 8 8 9 9 9 9 9 10 10 10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: We can exchange 5 cards with the same number to get 4 cards, reducing the count of each number by 1. After 10 exchanges, we will have 10 cards left, each with a different number.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```

99 3
1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 5 5 5 6 6 6 7 7 7 8 8 8 9 9 9 10 10 10 11 11 11 12 12 12 13 13 13 14 14 14 15 15 15 16 16 16 17 17 17 18 18 18 19 19 19 20 20 20 21 21 21 22 22 22 23 23 23 24 24 24 25 25 25 26 26 26 27 27 27 28 28 28 29 29 29 30 30 30 31 31 31 32 32 32 33 33 33
```
**Output**: 
```
33
```
**Explanation**: Each group of 3 cards can be exchanged for 2 cards, reducing the count of each number by 1. After 33 exchanges, we will have 33 cards left, each with a different number.
