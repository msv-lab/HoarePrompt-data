# Test 1
**Input**:

```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: 
- The tree is a simple triangle with nodes 1, 2, and 3. Starting at node 3, Ron can move to node 1 or node 2. If Ron moves to node 1, Hermione has no valid move since node 2 is not a neighbor of node 1. If Ron moves to node 2, Hermione can move to node 1, and then Ron has no valid move. Thus, Ron wins.

```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: 
- The tree is a straight line with nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Starting at node 5, Ron can only move to node 4. Hermione then moves to node 3, Ron to node 2, and Hermione to node 1. Ron then has no valid move, so Hermione wins.

Hermione
```
**Explanation**: 
- The tree is a straight line with nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. Starting at node 2, Ron can move to node 1 or node 3. If Ron moves to node 1, Hermione can move to node 2, and then Ron has no valid move. If Ron moves to node 3, Hermione can move to node 2, and then Ron has no valid move. Thus, Hermione wins.

**Explanation**: 
- The tree is a straight line with nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Starting at node 6, Ron can only move to node 5. Hermione then moves to node 4, Ron to node 3, Hermione to node 2, and Ron to node 1. Hermione then has no valid move, so Hermione wins.

Hermione
```
**Explanation**: 
- The tree is a straight line with nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Starting at node 7, Ron can only move to node 6. Hermione then moves to node 5, Ron to node 4, Hermione to node 3, Ron to node 2, and Hermione to node 1. Ron then has no valid move, so Hermione wins.

**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: 
- The tree is a straight line with nodes 1 to 10. Starting at node 5, Ron can move to node 4 or node 6. If Ron moves to node 4, Hermione can move to node 3, Ron to node 2, Hermione to node 1, Ron to node 3, Hermione to node 2, Ron to node 1, Hermione to node 4, Ron to node 5, Hermione to node 6, Ron to node 7, Hermione to node 8, Ron to node 9, and Hermione to node 10. Ron then has no valid move, so Hermione wins. If Ron moves to node 6, the sequence of moves is similar, and Hermione wins.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
100000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
99999 100000
100000
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: 
- The tree is a straight line with nodes 1 to 100000. Starting at node 100000, Ron can only move to node 99999. Hermione then moves to node 99998, Ron to node 99997, and so on. Since the number of nodes is even, Hermione will always have the last move, so Hermione wins.

# Test 9

**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: 
- The tree is a straight line with nodes 1 to 100000. Starting at node 1, Ron can only move to node 2. Hermione then moves to node 3, Ron to node 4, and so on. Since the number of nodes is even, Ron will always have the last move, so Ron wins.

# Test 10

...
99999 100000
50000
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: 
- The tree is a straight line with nodes 1 to 100000. Starting at node 50000, Ron can move to node 49999 or node 50001. If Ron moves to node 49999, Hermione can move to node 49998, Ron to node 49997, and so on. Since the number of nodes on either side of node 50000 is even, Hermione will always have the last move, so Hermione wins. If Ron moves to node 50001, the sequence of moves is similar, and Hermione wins.
