7 2 9 2 6 5 9
9 1 10 7 1 4 9
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Explanation**: Kirill can bribe the 2nd person to move to the 1st position, paying 7 + 9 = 16 coins. Then, he can bribe the 1st person to move to the 2nd position, paying 2 + 1 = 3 coins. Total = 16 - 7 = 9 coins.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
2 3
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Kirill can bribe the 1st person to move to the 1st position, paying 2 + 1 = 3 coins.

# Test 5 (Edge Case: Minimum n and m)
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Kirill is already in the 1st position, so he doesn't need to spend any coins.

# Test 6 (Edge Case: Maximum n and m)
**Input**: 
```
1
200000 200000
1 1 1 ... 1 (200000 times)
1 1 1 ... 1 (200000 times)
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Kirill is already in the 200000th position, so he doesn't need to spend any coins.

# Test 7 (Edge Case: All a_i and b_i are the same)
**Input**: 
```
1
5 3
10 10 10 10 10
10 10 10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
30
```
**Explanation**: Kirill can bribe the 3rd person to move to the 1st position, paying 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 coins.

# Test 8 (Edge Case: All a_i and b_i are different)
**Input**: 
```
1
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Explanation**: Kirill can bribe the 3rd person to move to the 1st position, paying 1 + 5 + 4 = 10 coins. Then, he can bribe the 1st person to move to the 2nd position, paying 2 + 4 = 6 coins. Total = 10 - 1 = 9 coins.

# Test 9 (Edge Case: Large values of a_i and b_i)
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
3000000000
```
**Explanation**: Kirill can bribe the 2nd person to move to the 1st position, paying 1000000000 + 1000000000 = 2000000000 coins. Then, he can bribe the 1st person to move to the 2nd position, paying 1000000000 + 1000000000 = 2000000000 coins. Total = 2000000000 + 1000000000 = 3000000000 coins.

# Test 10 (Edge Case: Large n with m = 1)
**Input**: 
```
1
5 1
1 2 3 4 5
5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
15
```
**Explanation**: Kirill can bribe the 5th person to move to the 1st position, paying 1 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 15 coins.

# Test 11 (Edge Case: Large n with m = n)
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Kirill is already in the 5th position, so he doesn't need to spend any coins.

# Test 12 (Edge Case: Random values with high n and m)
**Input**: 
```

10 5
3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3
5 9 2 6 5 3 5 9 4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
15
```
**Explanation**: Kirill can bribe the 5th person to move to the 1st position, paying 3 + 5 + 9 + 2 + 6 = 25 coins. Then, he can bribe the 1st person to move to the 2nd position, paying 1 + 9 + 2 + 6 = 18 coins. Total = 25 - 10 = 15 coins.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases, and extreme conditions, ensuring the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.
