Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1
BGECDCBDED
```
**Output**: 
```

```
1
10 2
BGECDCBDED
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: For 2 rounds, we need 2 of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. The input string lacks 2 'A's, 2 'F's, 1 'G', and 1 'C', so Vlad needs to create 5 more problems.

# Test 3

```
1
7 1
ABCDEFG
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: For 1 round, we need one of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. The input string already contains one of each, so Vlad needs to create 0 more problems.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
**Explanation**: For 1 round, we need one of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. The input string is empty, so Vlad needs to create all 7 problems.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
50 5
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
```
**Output**: 
```
35
```
**Explanation**: For 5 rounds, we need 5 of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. The input string contains 50 'A's, so Vlad needs to create 5 of each of the other 6 difficulties, totaling 35 problems.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
50 1
ABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGA
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: For 1 round, we need one of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. The input string contains at least one of each difficulty, so Vlad needs to create 0 more problems.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
49 1
ABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFG
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: For 1 round, we need one of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. The input string contains 49 characters, missing one, so Vlad needs to create 1 more problem.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
25 3
ABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFG
```
**Output**: 
```
14
```
**Explanation**: For 3 rounds, we need 3 of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. The input string contains 25 characters, missing 14 to meet the requirement, so Vlad needs to create 14 more problems.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
50 5
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFAA
```
**Output**: 
```
33
```
**Explanation**: For 5 rounds, we need 5 of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. The input string contains 48 'F's and 2 'A's, so Vlad needs to create 5 of each of the other 5 difficulties (30) and 3 more 'A's, totaling 33 problems.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1 5
A
```
**Output**: 
```
34
```
**Explanation**: For 5 rounds, we need 5 of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. The input string contains only 1 'A', so Vlad needs to create 4 more 'A's and 5 of each of the other 6 difficulties, totaling 34 problems.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
G
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: For 1 round, we need one of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. The input string contains only 1 'G', so Vlad needs to create 1 of each of the other 6 difficulties, totaling 6 problems.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
35 5
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: For 5 rounds, we need 5 of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. The input string contains 35 'A's, so Vlad needs to create 5 of each of the other 6 difficulties, totaling 30 problems, but since we already have 35 'A's, we need 5 less 'A's, which means we need 5 of each of the other 6 difficulties minus 5 'A's, so we need 5 of each of the other 5 difficulties, totaling 10 problems.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
35 1
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: For 1 round, we need one of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. The input string contains 35 'A's, so Vlad needs to create 1 of each of the other 6 difficulties, totaling 6 problems.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
35 2
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
```
**Output**: 
```
11
```
**Explanation**: For 2 rounds, we need 2 of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. The input string contains 35 'A's, so Vlad needs to create 2 of each of the other 6 difficulties, totaling 12 problems, but since we already have 35 'A's, we need 2 less 'A's, which means we need 2 of each of the other 6 difficulties minus 2 'A's, so we need 2 of each of the other 5 difficulties, totaling 11 problems.

These test cases should cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the function handles both basic and edge cases effectively.
