Sure, let's create a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem. These will include both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4 5
1 2 4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: As given in the problem statement example.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4 6
1 2 4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: One more attack than the previous test case, resulting in an additional ship sinking.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5 20
2 7 1 8 2
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: All ships will eventually sink due to the large number of attacks.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks the first ship twice, but neither ship sinks.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2 15
1 5
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks the first ship once, then the last ship multiple times until both sink.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2 7
5 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks the first ship twice, reducing its durability to 3, then attacks the last ship five times, sinking it first.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks the first and last ships once each, sinking two ships.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Only one ship with one durability point, which sinks after one attack.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10
10
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: One ship with high durability, which will eventually sink after 10 attacks.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: No attacks, so no ships sink.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000000000
1000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: One ship with extremely high durability, which will eventually sink after a very large number of attacks.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 1
1 1 1 1 1 ... 1 (100000 times)
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: 100000 ships, each with 1 durability point, and only one attack, so only one ship sinks.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 1000000000000000
1 1 1 1 1 ... 1 (100000 times)
```
**Output**: 
```
100000
```
**Explanation**: 100000 ships, each with 1 durability point, and a very large number of attacks, so all ships sink.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 1000000000000000
1000000000000000 1000000000000000 ... 1000000000000000 (100000 times)
```
**Output**: 
```
100000
```
**Explanation**: 100000 ships, each with extremely high durability, and a very large number of attacks, so all ships sink.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
10000
1 1
1
1 1
2
1 1
3
...
1 1
10000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
1
...
1
```
**Explanation**: 10000 test cases, each with one ship and one attack, resulting in one ship sinking in each case.

These test cases should cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring that the solution is robust and handles both typical and edge cases effectively.
