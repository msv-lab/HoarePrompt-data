# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: 
There is only one disk, so it's impossible to decrease the sum of radii while maintaining the conditions.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
2
0 0 1
1 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
The disks are tangent to each other. We can decrease both radii by 0.1, making the new radii 0.9, and the sum of radii decreases.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
2
0 0 1
2 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: 
The disks are not tangent and have a gap between them. Decreasing the radii will not change the fact that they do not overlap, and the sum of radii will decrease, but the condition of tangency is not met.

**Explanation**: 
The first four disks are tangent, and the fifth disk is tangent to the fourth. We can decrease the radii of the first four disks by 0.1 and the fifth disk by 0.2, making the new radii 0.9, 0.9, 0.9, 0.9, and 1.8, respectively.
