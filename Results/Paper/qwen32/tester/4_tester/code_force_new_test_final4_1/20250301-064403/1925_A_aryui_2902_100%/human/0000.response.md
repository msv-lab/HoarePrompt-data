Sure, let's create comprehensive test cases for the given problem. We will cover both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
a
```
**Explanation**: There is only one string of length 1 that can be formed using the first 1 lowercase English alphabet, which is "a".

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
aa
```
**Explanation**: There is only one string of length 2 that can be formed using the first 1 lowercase English alphabet, which is "aa".

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
ab
```
**Explanation**: There are two strings of length 1 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, which are "a" and "b". Both are present in "ab".

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
baab
```
**Explanation**: There are four strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets: "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb". All are present in "baab".

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1 26
```
**Output**: 
```
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Explanation**: There are 26 strings of length 1 that can be formed using the first 26 lowercase English alphabets. All are present in the string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2 26
```
**Output**: 
```
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Explanation**: There are 26^2 = 676 strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 26 lowercase English alphabets. A simple way to ensure all are present is to repeat the alphabet twice.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
26 26
```
**Output**: 
```
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz... (repeated 26 times)
```
**Explanation**: There are 26^26 strings of length 26 that can be formed using the first 26 lowercase English alphabets. A simple way to ensure all are present is to repeat the alphabet 26 times. Note: This is a theoretical case, and the actual output string will be very large.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 25
```
**Output**: 
```
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyza
```
**Explanation**: There are 25^2 = 625 strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 25 lowercase English alphabets. A simple way to ensure all are present is to repeat the alphabet once and add an extra 'a' at the end.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
25 1
```
**Output**: 
```
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
```
**Explanation**: There is only one string of length 25 that can be formed using the first 1 lowercase English alphabet, which is "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa".

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
baab
```
**Explanation**: There are four strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets: "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb". All are present in "baab". This is a repeat of Test 4 to ensure consistency.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
676
1 1
1 2
1 3
...
1 26
2 1
2 2
...
2 26
...
26 1
26 2
...
26 26
```
**Output**: 
```
a
ab
abc
...
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
a
aa
aab
...
aaa...a (26 times)
...
a
ab
abc
...
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
...
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz... (repeated 26 times)
```
**Explanation**: This tests all possible combinations of n and k within the given constraints. Each line of output corresponds to the expected result for each test case.

These test cases should cover a wide range of scenarios and help ensure the solution is robust and handles all edge cases effectively.
