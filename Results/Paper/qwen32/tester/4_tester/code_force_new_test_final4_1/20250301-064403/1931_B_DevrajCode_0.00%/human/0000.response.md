Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1
43
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Only one container, so it's trivially possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water is 4, which is divisible by 2, but it's impossible to make both containers have the same amount of water (2 units each) because the only operation is pouring water from a lower-indexed container to a higher-indexed container.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
4 5 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water is 15, which is divisible by 5. We can distribute the water to make each container have 3 units.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water is 6, which is divisible by 3, but it's impossible to make each container have 2 units of water using the given operation.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
7
4 5 5 0 6 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water is 28, which is divisible by 7, but it's impossible to make each container have 4 units of water using the given operation.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
7
6 5 5 1 3 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water is 28, which is divisible by 7. We can distribute the water to make each container have 4 units.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Both containers are already empty, so they trivially have the same amount of water.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers are empty, so they trivially have the same amount of water.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers already have the same amount of water.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water is 10, which is divisible by 4, but it's impossible to make each container have 2.5 units of water (which isn't feasible).

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers already have the same amount of water.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water is 55, which is divisible by 10, but it's impossible to make each container have 5.5 units of water (which isn't feasible).
