Sure, let's create a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem. We'll start with basic test cases and then move on to edge cases to ensure the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5 1
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Removing edge 1-3 splits the tree into two components: {1, 2} and {3, 4, 5}. Both components have at least 2 vertices.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
6 2
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Removing edges 2-3 and 4-5 splits the tree into three components: {1, 2}, {3, 4}, and {5, 6}. Each component has at least 2 vertices.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Removing edge 2-3 splits the tree into two components: {1, 2} and {3, 4}. Both components have at least 2 vertices.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Removing the only edge splits the tree into two components: {1} and {2}. Each component has at least 1 vertex.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
1 2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Removing edge 1-2 splits the tree into two components: {1, 3} and {2}. The component {2} has only 1 vertex, but it's valid since the minimum size is 1.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
7 2
1 2
1 3
1 4
4 5
4 6
4 7
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Removing edges 1-2 and 1-3 splits the tree into three components: {1, 4, 5, 6, 7}, {2}, and {3}. The component {1, 4, 5, 6, 7} can be further split by removing 4-5 and 4-6, resulting in components of size at least 2.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
8 3
1 2
1 3
2 4
2 5
3 6
3 7
3 8
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Removing edges 1-2, 1-3, and 2-4 splits the tree into five components: {1, 3, 6, 7, 8}, {2, 5, 4}. The component {1, 3, 6, 7, 8} can be further split by removing 3-6 and 3-7, resulting in components of size at least 1.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10 4
1 2
1 3
2 4
2 5
3 6
3 7
4 8
4 9
5 10
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Removing edges 1-2, 1-3, 2-4, and 2-5 splits the tree into six components: {1, 3, 6, 7}, {2, 5, 10}, {4, 8, 9}. The component {1, 3, 6, 7} can be further split by removing 3-6 and 3-7, resulting in components of size at least 2.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Removing edges 2-3 and 3-4 splits the tree into four components: {1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5}. Each component has at least 1 vertex.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 99999
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
99999 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Removing all but one edge splits the tree into 100000 components, each of size 1. This tests the scalability of the solution with the maximum possible input size.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
99999 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
49999
```
**Explanation**: Removing one edge splits the tree into two components: one with 49999 vertices and one with 50001 vertices. The smaller component has at least 49999 vertices.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring that the solution is robust and handles both basic and edge cases effectively.
