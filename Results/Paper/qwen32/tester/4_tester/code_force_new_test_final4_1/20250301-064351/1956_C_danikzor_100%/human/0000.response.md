**Explanation**: 
- A 1x1 matrix can only have one element, which should be set to 1 using one Type 1 operation.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
7 3
1 1 1 2
1 2 2 1
2 1 1 2
```
**Explanation**: 
- A 2x2 matrix can be filled optimally with the numbers 1, 2, 2, 1 to achieve a sum of 7. This can be done in 3 operations as shown.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
27 6
1 1 1 2 3
1 2 3 2 1
1 3 2 1 3
2 1 1 2 3
2 2 3 2 1
2 3 2 1 3
```
**Explanation**: 
- A 3x3 matrix can be filled optimally with the numbers 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3 to achieve a sum of 27. This can be done in 6 operations as shown.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
500
```
**Output**: 
```
6250000 1000
1 1 1 2 3 4 ... 500
1 2 2 1 3 4 ... 500
...
1 500 500 1 2 3 ... 499
2 1 1 2 3 4 ... 500
2 2 2 1 3 4 ... 500
...
2 500 500 1 2 3 ... 499
```
**Explanation**: 
- A 500x500 matrix can be filled optimally by setting each row and each column to the permutation [1, 2, ..., 500], achieving the maximum sum of 6250000. This can be done in 1000 operations as shown.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 1 1
7 3
1 1 1 2
1 2 2 1
2 1 1 2
```
**Explanation**: 
- Multiple test cases in a single input. The first test case is a 1x1 matrix, and the second is a 2x2 matrix. Each is handled independently.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
500
1
1
1
...
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 1 1
1 1
1 1 1
1 1
1 1 1
...
1 1
1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: 
- 500 test cases, each with a 1x1 matrix. Each test case is handled independently, and the output is the same for each.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
7 3
1 1 1 2
1 2 2 1
2 1 1 2
```
**Explanation**: 
- A 2x2 matrix filled optimally with the numbers 1, 2, 2, 1 to achieve a sum of 7. This can be done in 3 operations as shown. This test case is repeated to ensure consistency.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
7 3
1 1 1 2
1 2 2 1
2 1 1 2
```
**Explanation**: 
- A 2x2 matrix filled optimally with the numbers 1, 2, 2, 1 to achieve a sum of 7. This can be done in 3 operations as shown. This test case is repeated to ensure consistency.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
5
```
**Output**: 
```
325 10
1 1 1 2 3 4 5
1 2 2 1 3 4 5
1 3 3 2 1 4 5
1 4 4 3 2 1 5
1 5 5 4 3 2 1
2 1 1 2 3 4 5
2 2 2 1 3 4 5
2 3 3 2 1 4 5
2 4 4 3 2 1 5
2 5 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Explanation**: 
- A 5x5 matrix filled optimally by setting each row and each column to the permutation [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], achieving the maximum sum of 325. This can be done in 10 operations as shown.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including basic cases, edge cases, and multiple test cases in a single input.
