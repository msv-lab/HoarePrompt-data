Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: With only one part and one color, Bob can trivially repaint it to make all parts the same color.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: Since there is only one color, no matter how Alice paints the ribbon, Bob can repaint any part to make all parts the same color.

```
1
5 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Alice can paint the ribbon in an alternating pattern (e.g., [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]). Bob can only change one part, which won't make all parts the same color.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
50 50 50
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: Alice can paint each part a different color. Bob can change all 50 parts to make all parts the same color.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 1
