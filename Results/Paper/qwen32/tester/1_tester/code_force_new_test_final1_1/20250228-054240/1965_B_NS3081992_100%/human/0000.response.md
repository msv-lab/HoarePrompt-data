Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios:

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
**Explanation**: The only number we need to avoid is 2, and we can achieve this with the sequence [1].

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
6 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
2 3 4 5 6
```
**Explanation**: Since k=1, we need to avoid any subsequence summing to 1, which is trivially satisfied by starting from 2. All numbers from 2 to 6 can be formed.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
8 8
```
**Output**: 
```
