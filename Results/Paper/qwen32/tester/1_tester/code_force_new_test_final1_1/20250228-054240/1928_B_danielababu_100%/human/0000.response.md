Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Choosing `p = [2, 1]` results in the array `[3, 3]`, where `3` occurs twice.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
7 1 4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Choosing `p = [2, 3, 1, 4]` results in the array `[9, 4, 5, 5]`, where `5` occurs twice.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
103 102 104
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Choosing `p = [3, 1, 2]` results in the array `[106, 103, 106]`, where `106` occurs three times.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 101 1 100 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Choosing `p = [5, 2, 4, 1, 3]` results in the array `[6, 103, 5, 101, 4]`, where `101` occurs twice.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 10 100 1000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: No permutation can make any number occur more than once.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: No permutation can make any number occur more than once.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1000000000 999999997 999999999
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Choosing `p = [3, 1, 2]` results in the array `[1000000003, 999999998, 1000000001]`, where `1000000001` occurs twice.

# Test 8 (Edge Case: Single Element)
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Only one element, so the result is `1`.

# Test 9 (Edge Case: All Elements Same)
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: Choosing `p = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` results in the array `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, where no number occurs more than once. However, the original array already has all elements the same, so the answer is `5`.

# Test 10 (Edge Case: Large Numbers)
**Input**: 
```
1
3
999999999 999999998 999999997
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Choosing `p = [3, 2, 1]` results in the array `[1000000002, 1000000000, 999999998]`, where no number occurs more than once. However, the original array can be made to have all elements the same by choosing an appropriate permutation, resulting in `3`.

# Test 11 (Edge Case: Large Array Size)
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
1 2 3 ... 200000
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The array is a permutation itself, and no permutation can make any number occur more than twice.

# Test 12 (Edge Case: Multiple Test Cases)
**Input**: 
```
3
2
1 2
3
103 102 104
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
3
1
```
**Explanation**: Each test case is handled independently, and the results are as expected from the previous test cases.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the solution.
