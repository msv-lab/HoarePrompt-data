Sure, let's create a comprehensive set of test cases for the described problem. We will cover both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: As described in the example, after placing the rooks at (1, 2) and (2, 1), the remaining configurations are (3, 4) and (4, 3), or (3, 3) and (4, 4).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 0
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: With a 3x3 board and no initial moves, the first player can place a rook in any of the 3 rows and 3 columns, and the computer will mirror the move. This results in 3 * 2 = 6 possible configurations.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With a 2x2 board and an initial move at (1, 1), the computer skips its turn. The only possible configuration is placing a rook at (2, 2).

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: A 1x1 board with no initial moves. Only one configuration is possible, placing a rook at (1, 1).

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: A 1x1 board with an initial move at (1, 1). No further moves are possible, so there are no configurations.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 0
```
**Output**: 
```
9999900000
```
**Explanation**: A large board with no initial moves. The first player can place a rook in any of the 100000 rows and 100000 columns, and the computer will mirror the move. This results in 100000 * 99999 possible configurations, modulo 10^9+7.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
9999800001
```
**Explanation**: A large board with an initial move at (1, 1). The computer skips its turn. The first player can place a rook in any of the remaining 99999 rows and 99999 columns, and the computer will mirror the move. This results in 99999 * 99998 possible configurations, modulo 10^9+7.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
1 2
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: A 3x3 board with initial moves at (1, 2) and (2, 1). No further moves are possible, so there are no configurations.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
1 2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: A 3x3 board with initial moves at (1, 2) and (3, 3). The first player can place a rook at (2, 3), and the computer will place a rook at (3, 2). The first player can also place a rook at (2, 1), and the computer will place a rook at (1, 2), but this is the same configuration as the initial state.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 50000
1 2
2 1
3 4
4 3
5 6
...
99999 100000
100000 99999
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: A large board with 50000 initial moves. The board is fully occupied, so no further moves are possible, resulting in no configurations.

These test cases should cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases, and scalability.
