# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
3
7 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This is another example from the problem statement. It is not possible to make all elements zero.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
4
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
3
0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: If all elements are already zero, no operations are needed.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
3
1 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: It is impossible to make all elements zero because the middle element is zero, and the operation cannot be applied.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
3
1 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: It is impossible to make all elements zero because the operation cannot balance the array.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
4
1 2 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: It is possible to make all elements zero by applying the operation at index 2.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: It is impossible to make all elements zero because the operation cannot balance the array.

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: It is possible to make all elements zero by applying the operation at appropriate indices.

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
1
5
0 2 4 2 0
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: It is possible to make all elements zero by applying the operation at appropriate indices.

# Test 15
**Input**:
```
1
5
1 3 5 7 9
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: It is impossible to make all elements zero because the operation cannot balance the array.

# Test 16
**Input**:
```
1
5
9 7 5 3 1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: It is impossible to make all elements zero because the operation cannot balance the array.

# Test 17
**Input**:
```
1
100000
1 1 1 1 ... 1 1 1 1 (100000 ones)
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: With a large array of ones, it is impossible to make all elements zero due to the constraints of the operation.

# Test 18
**Input**:
```
1
100000
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 ... 1000000000 1000000000 (100000 elements, each 10^9)
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: With a large array of large numbers, it is impossible to make all elements zero due to the constraints of the operation.

# Test 19
**Input**:
```
10000
3
1 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
NO
NO
...
NO (10000 times)
```
**Explanation**: Repeating the same impossible case multiple times to test the scalability of the solution.

# Test 20
**Input**:
```
10000
3
0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
YES
YES
YES
...
YES (10000 times)
```
**Explanation**: Repeating the same trivial case multiple times to test the scalability of the solution.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases, and scalability considerations.
