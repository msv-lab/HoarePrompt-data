# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
6 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
6
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: 
- The tree is a path with 6 nodes. Starting from node 6, Ron can move the stone to node 5, Hermione to node 4, Ron to node 3, Hermione to node 2, and Ron to node 1. Hermione cannot make a move, so Ron wins.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
2 1
1 2
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: 
- The tree is a path with 2 nodes. Starting from node 1, Ron can move the stone to node 2. Hermione cannot make a move, so Ron wins.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
2 1
1 2
2
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: 
- The tree is a path with 2 nodes. Starting from node 2, Ron can move the stone to node 1. Hermione cannot make a move, so Hermione wins.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
100000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
99999 100000
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: 
- The tree is a path with 100,000 nodes. Starting from node 1, Ron can move the stone to node 2, Hermione to node 3, and so on. Since the number of nodes is even, Hermione will make the last move, and Ron will lose.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
100000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
99999 100000
100000

**Explanation**: 
- The tree is a path with 100,000 nodes. Starting from node 100,000, Ron can move the stone to node 99,999, Hermione to node 99,998, and so on. Since the number of nodes is even, Ron will make the last move, and Hermione will lose.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including small trees, large trees, and edge cases with minimal and maximal node counts.
