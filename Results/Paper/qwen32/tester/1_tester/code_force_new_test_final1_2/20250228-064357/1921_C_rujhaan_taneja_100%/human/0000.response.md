Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 3 1 5
3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 3 units of charge. Sending a message at moment 3 would consume 3 units, leaving 0 units, which is not allowed.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1 4 1 5
3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 4 units of charge. Sending a message at moment 3 would consume 3 units, leaving 1 unit, which is sufficient.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 10 1 2
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone can send all messages without turning off and on the phone. It consumes 3 units of charge, leaving 7 units.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 5 1 2
1 3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 5 units of charge. Sending messages at moments 1, 3, and 5 would consume 5 units, leaving 0 units after the last message. However, turning off and on the phone would consume additional energy, making it impossible to send all messages.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3 11 9 6
6 8 10
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone can turn off and on at strategic times to send all messages. For example, turn off at 0, on at 6, send at 6, turn off at 6, on at 8, send at 8, turn off at 8, on at 10, send at 10.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with a very high charge and sends a single message at a very high moment, consuming all charge but still having enough to send the message.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000 1 1000000000
1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with a very high charge but turning off and on the phone consumes more energy than the initial charge, making it impossible to send the message.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 10 1 1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone can send messages at moments 2 and 3 without turning off and on the phone, consuming 2 units of charge, leaving 8 units.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2 10 1 5
2 6
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone can turn off at 2, on at 3, send at 3, turn off at 3, on at 6, send at 6, consuming 5 units of charge for turning off and on, and 4 units for sending messages, leaving 1 unit.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
5 20 2 3
1 3 5 7 9
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone can turn off and on at strategic times to send all messages. For example, turn off at 0, on at 1, send at 1, turn off at 1, on at 3, send at 3, turn off at 3, on at 5, send at 5, turn off at 5, on at 7, send at 7, turn off at 7, on at 9, send at 9.

```
1
5 10 1 5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 10 units of charge but turning off and on the phone consumes more energy than the initial charge, making it impossible to send all messages.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 1 unit of charge and sending a message at moment 1 would consume 1 unit, leaving 0 units, which is not allowed.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2 1 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 2 units of charge and sends a message at moment 1, consuming 1 unit, leaving 1 unit.

# Test 14

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
2 10 1 1
1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone sends a message at moment 1, consuming 1 unit, leaving 9 units. It then turns off at 1, on at 1000000000, and sends a message at 1000000000, consuming 1 unit for turning off and on, and 999999999 units for sending the message, leaving 0 units.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
2 10 1 10
1 1000000000
```
