Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios:

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This is the example provided in the problem statement. After your move and the computer's mirrored move, there are three possible configurations.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 0
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: On a 3x3 board with no initial moves, the first player (you) can place a rook in 3 different positions, and the computer will mirror each move. The final configurations will be based on these initial placements.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: On a 2x2 board with no initial moves, the first player can place a rook in one position, and the computer will mirror it. The only final configuration is when both rooks are placed at (1, 2) and (2, 1).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: On a 1x1 board, there is only one possible configuration where you place a rook at (1, 1).

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2
1 2
3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Explanation**: On a 5x5 board with two initial moves, there are multiple valid configurations after both players have placed their rooks. The output is calculated based on the remaining valid positions.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
6 3
1 2
3 4
5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
27
```
**Explanation**: On a 6x6 board with three initial moves, the number of valid configurations increases as more rooks are placed. The output is calculated based on the remaining valid positions.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1000 0
```
**Output**: 
```
499500
```
**Explanation**: On a 1000x1000 board with no initial moves, the number of possible configurations is large. The output is calculated based on the number of ways to place rooks without attacking each other.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1000 1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
499001
```
**Explanation**: On a 1000x1000 board with one initial move, the computer skips its turn since the move is on the diagonal. The number of possible configurations is reduced but still large.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1000 499
1 2
3 4
5 6
7 8
...
997 998
999 1000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: On a 1000x1000 board with 499 initial moves, the board is almost full, and there are no valid positions left for further moves. The output is 0.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1000 500
1 2
2 1
3 4
4 3
...
999 1000
1000 999
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: On a 1000x1000 board with 500 initial moves, the board is full, and there are no valid positions left for further moves. The output is 0.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
300000 0
```
**Output**: 
```
44999850000
```
**Explanation**: On a 300000x300000 board with no initial moves, the number of possible configurations is extremely large. The output is calculated based on the number of ways to place rooks without attacking each other, modulo 10^9+7.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
300000 1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
44999750001
```
**Explanation**: On a 300000x300000 board with one initial move, the computer skips its turn since the move is on the diagonal. The number of possible configurations is reduced but still extremely large.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
300000 149999
1 2
3 4
5 6
7 8
...
299997 299998
299999 300000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: On a 300000x300000 board with 149999 initial moves, the board is almost full, and there are no valid positions left for further moves. The output is 0.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
300000 150000
1 2
2 1
3 4
4 3
...
299999 300000
300000 299999
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: On a 300000x300000 board with 150000 initial moves, the board is full, and there are no valid positions left for further moves. The output is 0.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including small and large board sizes, different numbers of initial moves, and edge cases like full boards and diagonal moves.
