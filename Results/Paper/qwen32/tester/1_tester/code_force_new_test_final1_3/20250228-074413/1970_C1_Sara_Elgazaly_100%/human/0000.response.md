Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem, covering both Basic and Edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3 1
2 3
3 1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a simple triangle. Starting from node 3, Ron can move to node 1 or node 2. If he moves to node 1, Hermione can move to node 2, and Ron cannot move. If he moves to node 2, Hermione can move to node 1, and Ron cannot move. In both cases, Ron wins.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
5 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: Starting from node 5, Ron can move to node 4. Hermione can then move to node 3, Ron to node 2, and Hermione to node 1. Ron cannot move, so Hermione wins.

# Test 3

```
4 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: Starting from node 1, Ron can move to node 2. Hermione can then move to node 3, and Ron to node 4. Hermione cannot move, so Ron wins.

```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: Starting from node 6, Ron can move to node 5. Hermione can then move to node 4, Ron to node 3, Hermione to node 2, and Ron to node 1. Hermione cannot move, so Hermione wins.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2 1
1 2
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: Starting from node 1, Ron can move to node 2. Hermione cannot move, so Ron wins.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
2 1
1 2
2
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: Starting from node 2, Ron can move to node 1. Hermione cannot move, so Ron wins.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
3 1
1 2
2 3
2
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: Starting from node 2, Ron can move to node 1 or node 3. If he moves to node 1, Hermione can move to node 3, and Ron cannot move. If he moves to node 3, Hermione can move to node 1, and Ron cannot move. In both cases, Ron wins.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
4 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
2
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: Starting from node 2, Ron can move to node 1 or node 3. If he moves to node 1, Hermione can move to node 3, Ron to node 4, and Hermione cannot move. If he moves to node 3, Hermione can move to node 1, Ron to node 4, and Hermione cannot move. In both cases, Hermione wins.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
10 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
6 7
7 8
8 9
9 10
5
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: Starting from node 5, Ron can move to node 4 or node 6. If he moves to node 4, Hermione can move to node 3, Ron to node 2, Hermione to node 1, Ron to node 6, Hermione to node 7, Ron to node 8, Hermione to node 9, and Ron to node 10. Hermione cannot move, so Hermione wins. If he moves to node 6, Hermione can move to node 5, Ron to node 4, Hermione to node 3, Ron to node 2, Hermione to node 1, Ron to node 7, Hermione to node 8, Ron to node 9, and Hermione to node 10. Hermione cannot move, so Hermione wins.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
100000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
99999 100000
100000
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: Starting from node 100000, Ron can move to node 99999. Hermione can then move to node 99998, Ron to node 99997, and so on. Hermione will always have a move until the last move, where Ron will be unable to move, so Hermione wins. This tests the scalability of the solution with the maximum number of nodes.
