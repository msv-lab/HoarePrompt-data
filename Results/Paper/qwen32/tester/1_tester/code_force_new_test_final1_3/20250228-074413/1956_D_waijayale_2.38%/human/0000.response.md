Sure, let's create a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem.

### Basic Test Cases

**Test 1**
**Input**: 
```
2
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4 1
1 2
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of {0, 1} is 2. Applying the operation on the entire array results in [2, 2], which gives the maximum sum of 4.

**Test 2**
**Input**: 
```
3
1 3 9
```
**Output**: 
```
13 0
```
**Explanation**: The initial sum is 13, which is already the maximum sum. No operations are needed.

**Test 3**
**Input**: 
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
**Explanation**: Applying the operation on index 3 results in [1, 100, 0, 1], then applying the operation on indices 3 and 4 results in [1, 100, 2, 2], giving the maximum sum of 105.

**Test 4**
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 1
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of {0} is 1. Applying the operation on the entire array results in [1], which gives the maximum sum of 1.

### Edge Test Cases

**Test 5**
**Input**: 
```
1
10000000
```
**Output**: 
```
0 1
1 1
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of {10000000} is 0. Applying the operation on the entire array results in [0], which gives the maximum sum of 0.

**Test 6**
**Input**: 
```
18
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17
```
**Output**: 
```
171 0
```
**Explanation**: The initial sum is 171, which is already the maximum sum. No operations are needed.

**Test 7**
**Input**: 
```
18
17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
171 0
```
**Explanation**: The initial sum is 171, which is already the maximum sum. No operations are needed.

**Test 8**
**Input**: 
```
18
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
171 18
1 1
2 2
3 3
4 4
5 5
6 6
7 7
8 8
9 9
10 10
11 11
12 12
13 13
14 14
15 15
16 16
17 17
18 18
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of {0} is 1. Applying the operation on each index results in [1, 1, 1, ..., 1], which gives the maximum sum of 171.

**Test 9**
**Input**: 
```
18
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
171 18
1 1
2 2
3 3
4 4
5 5
6 6
7 7
8 8
9 9
10 10
11 11
12 12
13 13
14 14
15 15
16 16
17 17
18 18
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of {1} is 0. Applying the operation on each index results in [0, 0, 0, ..., 0], then applying the operation again on each index results in [1, 1, 1, ..., 1], which gives the maximum sum of 171.

**Test 10**
**Input**: 
```
18
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
```
**Output**: 
```
171 1
1 18
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of {1, 2, 3, ..., 18} is 0. Applying the operation on the entire array results in [0, 0, 0, ..., 0], then applying the operation again on the entire array results in [17, 17, 17, ..., 17], which gives the maximum sum of 171.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases with all identical elements, and cases where the array is already in its optimal state.
