**Explanation**: This tests the swap operation for slightly larger values of `n`.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
100
```
**Output**: 
```
64
```
**Explanation**: This tests a larger value of `n` to ensure the swap operation is correctly implemented for a moderately large array.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This is the minimum possible value of `n`. It checks the behavior when there is only one element in the array.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This is the smallest non-trivial case. It checks the behavior when there are exactly two elements in the array.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
536870912
```
**Explanation**: This is the maximum possible value of `n`. It checks the behavior and performance of the solution for the largest possible input.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: This tests the smallest odd value of `n` greater than 1.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
4
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: This tests the smallest even value of `n` greater than 2.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
9
```
**Output**: 
```
8
```
**Explanation**: This tests a perfect square value of `n` to ensure the swap operation handles divisors correctly.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
16
```
**Output**: 
```
16
```
**Explanation**: This tests another perfect square value of `n` to ensure the swap operation handles divisors correctly.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
1024
```
**Output**: 
```
1024
```
**Explanation**: This tests a power of 2 value of `n` to ensure the swap operation handles divisors correctly.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000001
```
**Output**: 
```
536870912
```
**Explanation**: This tests a value of `n` that is just above a power of 2 to ensure the solution handles such cases correctly.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000002
```
**Output**: 
```
536870912
```
**Explanation**: This tests another value of `n` that is just above a power of 2 to ensure the solution handles such cases correctly.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases, and performance considerations.
