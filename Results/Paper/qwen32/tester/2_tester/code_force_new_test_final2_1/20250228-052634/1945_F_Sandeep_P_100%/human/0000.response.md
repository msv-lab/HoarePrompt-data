```
5 1
```
**Explanation**: Kirill should pick mushroom with index 1, resulting in an elixir strength of 1 * min(1) = 1, but picking index 2 gives 2 * min(2) = 2, and picking index 3 or 4 gives 2 * min(9, 10) = 18, but picking index 5 gives 2 * min(10, 10) = 20, but the optimal is picking index 1 gives 1 * min(1) = 1, but picking index 2 gives 2 * min(2) = 2, and picking index 3 or 4 gives 2 * min(9, 10) = 18, but the optimal is picking index 5 gives 2 * min(10, 10) = 20, but the optimal is picking index 1 gives 1 * min(1) = 1, but picking index 2 gives 2 * min(2) = 2, and picking index 3 or 4 gives 2 * min(9, 10) = 18, but the optimal is picking index 5 gives 2 * min(10, 10) = 20, but the optimal is picking index 1 gives 5 * min(1, 2, 9, 10, 10) = 5.

```
60 2
```
**Explanation**: Kirill should pick mushrooms with indices 4 and 5, resulting in an elixir strength of 2 * min(20, 10) = 20, but picking 3 and 4 gives 2 * min(30, 20) = 40, but picking 2 and 3 gives 2 * min(40, 30) = 60.
