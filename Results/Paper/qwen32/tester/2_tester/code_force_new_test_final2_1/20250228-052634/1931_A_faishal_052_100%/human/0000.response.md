# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
52
```
**Output**:

```
**Explanation**: The smallest word that sums to 27 is "aaz" (1 + 1 + 25).

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10
```
**Output**: 
```
aai
```
**Explanation**: The smallest word that sums to 10 is "aai" (1 + 1 + 8).

# Test 13

```
1
15
```
**Output**: 
```
aao
```
**Explanation**: The smallest word that sums to 15 is "aao" (1 + 1 + 13).

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
21
```
**Output**: 
```
aau
```
**Explanation**: The smallest word that sums to 21 is "aau" (1 + 1 + 19).

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
39
```
**Output**: 
```
aaz
```
**Explanation**: The smallest word that sums to 39 is "aaz" (1 + 1 + 37), but the correct smallest word is "aaz" (1 + 1 + 26).

### Multiple Test Cases

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
5
3
24
78
55
48
```
**Output**: 
```
