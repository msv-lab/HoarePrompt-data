```
1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Increasing the single element to 1000000001 makes the median 1000000001, which is greater than the original median 1000000000.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 5 5 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Increasing the first three elements to 6 makes the median 6, which is greater than the original median 5.

2
```
**Explanation**: Increasing the first and third elements to 3 makes the median 3, which is greater than the original median 2.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Increasing both elements to 3 makes the median 3, which is greater than the original median 1.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Increasing both elements to 2 makes the median 2, which is greater than the original median 1.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4
5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Increasing the first three elements to 6 makes the median 6, which is greater than the original median 5.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 1 1 ... 1 (100000 ones)
```
**Output**: 
```
50000
```
**Explanation**: The median of 100000 ones is 1. To increase the median, we need to increase 50000 elements to 2.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 2 3 ... 100000 (ascending order)
```
**Output**: 
```
50000
```
**Explanation**: The median of the array is 50000. To increase the median, we need to increase 50000 elements.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
100000 99999 99998 ... 1 (descending order)
```
**Output**: 
```
50000
```
**Explanation**: The median of the array is 50000. To increase the median, we need to increase 50000 elements.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
10000
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
1
...
1 (10000 ones)
```
**Explanation**: Each test case has a single element array with value 1. Increasing it to 2 makes the median 2.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
50000 50000 50000 ... 50000 (100000 fifties)
```
**Output**: 
```
50000
```
**Explanation**: The median of the array is 50000. To increase the median, we need to increase 50000 elements.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 3 2 4 3 2 ... 3 2 1 (palindromic sequence)
```
**Output**: 
```
50000
```
**Explanation**: The median of the array is 3. To increase the median, we need to increase 50000 elements.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 1 1 ... 1 1000000000 (99999 ones and one billion)
```
**Output**: 
```
50000
```
**Explanation**: The median of the array is 1. To increase the median, we need to increase 50000 elements.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including small and large arrays, uniform and varied elements, and edge cases like single-element arrays and arrays with identical elements.
