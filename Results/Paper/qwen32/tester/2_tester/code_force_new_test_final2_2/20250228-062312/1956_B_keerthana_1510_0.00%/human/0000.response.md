**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: All cards are unique, so no points can be scored.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: With only one card, no points can be scored.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Both cards are the same. You place one card and score a point when you place the second card.

**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: All cards are unique, so no points can be scored.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 2 3 ... 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: All cards are unique, so no points can be scored. This tests the upper limit of the input size.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 1 2 2 3 3 ... 50000 50000
```
**Output**: 
```
50000
```
**Explanation**: You have 50000 pairs of cards. You can score a point for each pair, resulting in a maximum score of 50000. This tests the upper limit of the input size with all pairs.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: You have 10 cards with the same number. You can place 5 cards and score a point for each of the remaining 5 cards, resulting in a maximum score of 4.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: You have one pair and 8 unique cards. You can score a point for the pair.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: You have one pair and 8 unique cards. You can score a point for the pair.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This is an invalid input as it contains more than 2 cards with the same number. However, since the problem guarantees that each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence at most 2 times, this test case is not applicable. It is included here for completeness.

### Scalability Test Cases

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
10000
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
0
0
...
0
```
**Explanation**: 10000 test cases, each with 1 card. No points can be scored in any of these cases.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
10000
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
1
...
1
```
**Explanation**: 10000 test cases, each with 2 cards that are the same. You can score 1 point in each case.

# Test 16
