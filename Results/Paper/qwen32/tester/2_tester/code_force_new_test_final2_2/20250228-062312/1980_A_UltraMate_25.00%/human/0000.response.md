```
1
50 1
ABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFG
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Comments**: One round is needed, and the bank has exactly six of each problem type ('A' to 'G'). This is the maximum number of problems per type possible within the constraint.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
50 5
ABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFG

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
50 5
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
```
**Output**: 
```
30
```
**Comments**: Five rounds are needed, but the bank has only 'A' problems. All other problem types ('B' to 'G') are missing, and 30 more are needed.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
25 5
ABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFG
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Comments**: Five rounds are needed, and the bank has exactly six of each problem type ('A' to 'G'). This is sufficient for five rounds.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
25 5
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
```

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
1 5
A
```
**Output**: 
```
30
```
**Comments**: Five rounds are needed, but the bank has only one 'A' problem. All other problem types ('B' to 'G') are missing, and 30 more are needed.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
7 5
ABCDEFG
```
**Output**: 
```
28
```
