Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
10
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The string "10" can be sorted by performing a cyclic shift on the entire string, resulting in "01" with a cost of 2.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
0000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The string "0000" is already sorted, so no operations are needed.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
11000
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Explanation**: The string "11000" can be sorted by performing cyclic shifts on substrings [1, 3], [2, 4], and [3, 5] with a total cost of 9.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
101011
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: The string "101011" can be sorted by performing cyclic shifts on substrings [1, 2], [3, 4], and [5, 6] with a total cost of 5.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
01101001
```
**Output**: 
```
11
```
**Explanation**: The string "01101001" can be sorted by performing cyclic shifts on substrings [2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7], and [1, 8] with a total cost of 11.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The string "1" is trivially sorted as it has only one character.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The string "0" is trivially sorted as it has only one character.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
11111111111111111111
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The string "11111111111111111111" is already sorted, so no operations are needed.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
00000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The string "00000000000000000000" is already sorted, so no operations are needed.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10101010101010101010
```
**Output**: 
```
45
```
**Explanation**: The string "10101010101010101010" can be sorted by performing cyclic shifts on substrings of increasing lengths, resulting in a total cost of 45.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
01010101010101010101
```
**Output**: 
```
45
```
**Explanation**: The string "01010101010101010101" can be sorted by performing cyclic shifts on substrings of increasing lengths, resulting in a total cost of 45.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10010010010010010010
```
**Output**: 
```
90
```
**Explanation**: The string "10010010010010010010" can be sorted by performing cyclic shifts on substrings of increasing lengths, resulting in a total cost of 90.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
11111111111111111110
```
**Output**: 
```
20
```
**Explanation**: The string "11111111111111111110" can be sorted by performing a single cyclic shift on the entire string, resulting in a cost of 20.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
01111111111111111111
```
**Output**: 
```
20
```
**Explanation**: The string "01111111111111111111" can be sorted by performing a single cyclic shift on the entire string, resulting in a cost of 20.
