Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3 1
2 3
3 1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a simple triangle. Starting from node 3, Ron can move to node 1 or node 2. Hermione will then be forced to move to the remaining node, and Ron will win.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
5 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: Starting from node 5, Ron can move to node 4. Hermione then moves to node 3, Ron to node 2, and Hermione to node 1. Hermione wins as Ron cannot make a move.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
4 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
2
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: Starting from node 2, Ron can move to node 1 or node 3. Hermione will then be forced to move to the remaining node, and Ron will win.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
2 1
1 2
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a simple edge between two nodes. Ron starts on node 1 and moves to node 2, winning the game.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2 1
1 2
2
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a simple edge between two nodes. Ron starts on node 2 and moves to node 1, Hermione wins the game.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
3 1
1 2
2 3
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: Starting from node 1, Ron can move to node 2. Hermione then moves to node 3, and Ron wins.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
3 1
1 2
2 3
2
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: Starting from node 2, Ron can move to node 1 or node 3. Hermione will then be forced to move to the remaining node, and Hermione wins.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
100000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
99999 100000
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: A very large tree with 100,000 nodes, starting from node 1. Ron will always win because the number of nodes is even, and he can force Hermione into a losing position.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
100000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
99999 100000
100000
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: A very large tree with 100,000 nodes, starting from node 100,000. Hermione will always win because the number of nodes is even, and she can force Ron into a losing position.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
5 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
3
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: Starting from node 3, Ron can move to node 2 or node 4. Hermione will then be forced to move to the remaining node, and Hermione wins.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including small trees, large trees, and different starting positions, ensuring the code's robustness and reliability.
