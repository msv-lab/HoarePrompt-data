Sure, let's create a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem. We'll start with basic test cases and then move on to edge cases.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3
10 1
BGECDCBDED
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: For 1 round, we need 1 of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. We have 'B', 'G', 'E', 'C', 'D', 'B', 'D', 'E', 'D', so we lack 'A' and 'F'.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
10 2
BGECDCBDED
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: For 2 rounds, we need 2 of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. We have 'B', 'G', 'E', 'C', 'D', 'B', 'D', 'E', 'D', so we lack 'A' x2, 'F' x2, and 'C' x1.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
9 1
BBCDEFFGG
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: For 1 round, we need 1 of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. We have 'B', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'F', 'G', 'G', so we lack 'A'.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1 1
A
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: For 1 round, we need 1 of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. We have 'A', so we lack 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
7 1
ABCDEFG
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: For 1 round, we need 1 of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. We have 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', so we have all required difficulties.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
50 5
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
```
**Output**: 
```
30
```
**Explanation**: For 5 rounds, we need 5 of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. We have 50 'A's, so we lack 'B' x5, 'C' x5, 'D' x5, 'E' x5, 'F' x5, 'G' x5.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
50 1
ABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFG
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: For 1 round, we need 1 of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. We have more than enough of each difficulty level.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1 5
A
```
**Output**: 
```
30
```
**Explanation**: For 5 rounds, we need 5 of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. We have 1 'A', so we lack 'A' x4, 'B' x5, 'C' x5, 'D' x5, 'E' x5, 'F' x5, 'G' x5.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
7 5
ABCDEFG
```
**Output**: 
```
28
```
**Explanation**: For 5 rounds, we need 5 of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. We have 1 of each, so we lack 'A' x4, 'B' x4, 'C' x4, 'D' x4, 'E' x4, 'F' x4, 'G' x4.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
50 5
GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
```
**Output**: 
```
30
```
**Explanation**: For 5 rounds, we need 5 of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. We have 50 'G's, so we lack 'A' x5, 'B' x5, 'C' x5, 'D' x5, 'E' x5, 'F' x5.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases with minimal and maximal inputs, and various combinations of difficulties.
