Certainly! Below are the comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1
BGECDCBDED
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: For 1 round, we need one of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. The input string is missing 'A' and 'F', so we need 2 more problems.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
10 2
BGECDCBDED
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: For 2 rounds, we need two of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. The input string is missing 2 'A's, 2 'F's, and 1 'G', so we need 5 more problems.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
9 1
BBCDEFFGG
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: For 1 round, we need one of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. The input string is missing 'A', so we need 1 more problem.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
7 5
ABCDEFG
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: For 5 rounds, we need five of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. The input string has exactly one of each, so no additional problems are needed.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
**Explanation**: For 1 round, we need one of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G', but the input string is empty, so we need all 7 problems.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
35 5
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
```
**Output**: 
```
25
```
**Explanation**: For 5 rounds, we need five of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. The input string has 15 'A's and no other difficulties, so we need 5 'B's, 5 'C's, 5 'D's, 5 'E's, 5 'F's, and 5 'G's, totaling 25 more problems.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
50 1
ABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDE
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: For 1 round, we need one of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. The input string has more than enough of each difficulty, so no additional problems are needed.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5
ABCDEFG
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: For 5 rounds, we need five of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. The input string has exactly one of each, so no additional problems are needed.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
5 1
GGGGG
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: For 1 round, we need one of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. The input string has 5 'G's and no other difficulties, so we need 1 'A', 1 'B', 1 'C', 1 'D', 1 'E', and 1 'F', totaling 6 more problems.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
50 5
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
```
**Output**: 
```
25
```
**Explanation**: For 5 rounds, we need five of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. The input string has 50 'A's and no other difficulties, so we need 5 'B's, 5 'C's, 5 'D's, 5 'E's, 5 'F's, and 5 'G's, totaling 25 more problems.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, ensuring that the code is robust, reliable, and scalable.
