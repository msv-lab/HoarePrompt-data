Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of test cases that cover both basic and edge scenarios for the given problem.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
6 2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: This is the example provided in the problem statement. There are 4 valid tuples as described.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: With only one element, no valid tuples can be formed since we need at least three indices x, y, z.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: There are 10 valid tuples (x, y, z) that satisfy the given condition.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: All elements are the same, so the XOR results will be zero, and no tuples will satisfy the condition.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
<expected_output>
```
**Explanation**: This is a large input size case to test the scalability of the solution. The expected output will depend on the actual computation, but the solution should handle it efficiently.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: All elements are the same large number, so the XOR results will be zero, and no tuples will satisfy the condition.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The last element is different, which can form valid tuples with the first four elements.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: This alternating pattern can form many valid tuples.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
3
1 2 3
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
10
4
0
```
**Explanation**: Multiple test cases in one input file to test the function's ability to handle multiple test cases correctly.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
1
1 1 1 1 1
1
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
0
0
```
**Explanation**: All elements are the same in each test case, so no valid tuples can be formed.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
1
5 4 3 2 1
1
1 3 5 7 9
```
**Output**: 
```
10
10
10
```
**Explanation**: Different patterns in each test case to ensure the function handles various scenarios correctly.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 1 2 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: This pattern can form several valid tuples due to the alternating and repeating elements.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 1 1 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: This pattern can form several valid tuples due to the alternating and repeating elements.

These test cases should cover a wide range of scenarios to ensure the robustness, reliability, and scalability of the solution.
