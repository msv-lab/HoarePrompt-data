Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5 4
1 2 1 4 5
1 5
4 4
3 4
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
NO
YES
NO
```
**Explanation**: 
- The entire array is good because we can construct `b` as `[2, 1, 2, 3, 6]`.
- The subarray `[4, 4]` is not good because it only contains one element and cannot have a different positive integer.
- The subarray `[3, 4]` is good because we can construct `b` as `[2, 3]`.
- The subarray `[1, 3]` is not good because the sum of `[1, 2, 1]` is 4, and any `b` with different elements and positive integers will not sum to 4.

```
1
1 1
1
1 1
```

```
NO
```
**Explanation**:

1 1 1 1 1 1
1 6
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: 
- The subarray `[1, 6]` sums to 6, and there is no way to construct `b` with different elements that also sum to 6.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
1 10
```

YES
```
**Explanation**: 
- The subarray `[1, 10]` sums to 55, and we can construct `b` as `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1]`.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 1
2 2
3 3
4 4
5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
NO
NO
NO
NO
```
**Explanation**: 
- Each subarray contains only one element, which cannot be different from itself.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
6 1
1 1 1 1 1 1000000000
1 6
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
- The subarray `[1, 6]` sums to 1000000006, and we can construct `b` as `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 999999999]`.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: 
- The subarray `[1, 3]` sums to 3000000000, and there is no way to construct `b` with different elements that also sum to 3000000000.
