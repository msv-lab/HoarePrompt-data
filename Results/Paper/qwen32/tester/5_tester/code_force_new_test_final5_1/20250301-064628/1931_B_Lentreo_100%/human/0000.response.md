Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1
43
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Only one container, so it's trivially possible to have the same amount of water in all containers.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: It's impossible to make both containers have the same amount of water using the allowed operation.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
4 5 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: As shown in the example, it's possible to make all containers have 3 units of water.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: It's impossible to equalize the water in all containers using the allowed operation.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
7
4 5 5 0 6 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The total sum is 28, which is divisible by 7, but it's impossible to make all containers have 4 units of water.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
7
6 5 5 1 3 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The total sum is 28, which is divisible by 7, and it's possible to make all containers have 4 units of water.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Both containers are already empty, so they trivially have the same amount of water.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers are already empty, so they trivially have the same amount of water.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The total sum is 55, which is not divisible by 10, but since the problem guarantees divisibility, this case should not occur. However, it's a good check for robustness.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers already have the same amount of water.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Both containers have the same amount of water, which is the maximum possible value.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1000000000 0 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: It's impossible to equalize the water in all containers using the allowed operation.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 1 1 1 ... 1 (100000 ones)
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers already have the same amount of water, which is 1.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
0 0 0 0 ... 0 (100000 zeros)
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers are already empty, so they trivially have the same amount of water.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
50000000 50000000 50000000 ... 50000000 (100000 fifties)
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers already have the same amount of water, which is 50000000.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases, and large input sizes to ensure the robustness and scalability of the solution.
