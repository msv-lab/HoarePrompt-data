Sure, let's create a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem. We'll start with basic scenarios and then move to edge cases.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 5
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: Only one number is needed, and it must be 5 to satisfy the sum condition.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
3 0
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 3, and we can use 3 and 0 to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their OR, which is 3 (11 in binary).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 5
```
**Output**: 
```
5 0
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 5, and we can use 5 and 0 to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their OR, which is 5 (101 in binary).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6 51
```
**Output**: 
```
3 1 1 32 2 12
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 51, and using these numbers, the OR of the sequence is 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 101111 (5 in binary), maximizing the number of 1s.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Only one number is needed, and it must be 1 to satisfy the sum condition.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000
```
**Explanation**: Only one number is needed, and it must be 1,000,000,000 to satisfy the sum condition.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 1 ... 1 1 1 0 (99999 ones followed by one zero)
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 100,000, and using 99,999 ones and one zero will maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their OR.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 2, and using two 1s will maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their OR, which is 1 | 1 = 11 (2 in binary).

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 0
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 1, and using 1 and 0 will maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their OR, which is 1 (1 in binary).

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
4 0
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 4, and using 4 and 0 will maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their OR, which is 4 (100 in binary).

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 10, and using nine 2s and one 0 will maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their OR, which is 1111111110 (511 in binary).

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1023
```
**Output**: 
```
1023 0
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 1023, and using 1023 and 0 will maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their OR, which is 1023 (1111111111 in binary).

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1024
```
**Output**: 
```
1024 0
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 1024, and using 1024 and 0 will maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their OR, which is 1024 (10000000000 in binary).

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1048575
```
**Output**: 
```
1048575 0
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 1,048,575, and using 1,048,575 and 0 will maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their OR, which is 1,048,575 (11111111111111111111 in binary).

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1048576
```
**Output**: 
```
1048576 0
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 1,048,576, and using 1,048,576 and 0 will maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their OR, which is 1,048,576 (100000000000000000000 in binary).

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, from basic to edge cases, ensuring the solution is robust and handles all possible inputs within the given constraints.
