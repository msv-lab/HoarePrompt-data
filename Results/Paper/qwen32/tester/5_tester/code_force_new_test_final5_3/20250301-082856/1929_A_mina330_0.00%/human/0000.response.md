Sure, let's create comprehensive test cases for the given problem. We will cover both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The array can be rearranged to [1, 2, 3] to get the maximum beauty of (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3
69 69 69
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: All elements are the same, so no matter the arrangement, the beauty will be 0.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
100 54 80 43 90
```
**Output**: 
```
57
```
**Explanation**: The array can be rearranged to [43, 54, 80, 90, 100] to get the maximum beauty of (54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 57.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
4
3 4 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The array can be rearranged to [3, 3, 3, 4] to get the maximum beauty of (3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The array can be rearranged to [1, 2] to get the maximum beauty of (2 - 1) = 1.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
999999999
```
**Explanation**: The maximum difference between two elements is when the largest element is at the end and the smallest at the beginning.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
999999999
```
**Explanation**: Similar to Test 6, but the smallest element is first.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
100
1 2 3 4 5 ... 100
```
**Output**: 
```
99
```
**Explanation**: The array is already in increasing order, so the beauty is the sum of differences from 1 to 99, which is 99.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
100
100 99 98 97 ... 1
```
**Output**: 
```
99
```
**Explanation**: The array is in decreasing order, so the beauty is the sum of differences from 99 to 1, which is 99.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100
1 100 2 99 3 98 ... 50 51
```
**Output**: 
```
99
```
**Explanation**: The array is in a zigzag pattern, but the maximum beauty achievable is still 99 by arranging it in increasing order.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
500
2
1 2
2
2 1
2
1 1
2
1000000000 1
2
1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
0
999999999
999999999
...
1
1
0
999999999
999999999
```
**Explanation**: Repeats the basic and edge cases for multiple test cases to ensure the function handles multiple inputs correctly.

These test cases should cover a wide range of scenarios and help ensure the solution is robust and reliable.
