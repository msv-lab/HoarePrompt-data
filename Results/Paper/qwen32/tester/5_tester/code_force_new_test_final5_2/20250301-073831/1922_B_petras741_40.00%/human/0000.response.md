Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The sticks all have the same length of 1. No non-degenerate triangle can be formed.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The sticks have lengths 1, 2, 4, and 8. The possible triangles are (1,2,4), (1,2,8), (1,4,8), and (2,4,8).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 0 1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
12
```
**Explanation**: The sticks have lengths 1, 1, 2, 2, and 4. The possible triangles are (1,1,2), (1,1,2), (1,1,4), (1,2,2), (1,2,2), (1,2,4), (1,2,4), (1,2,4), (1,2,4), (2,2,4), (2,2,4), and (2,2,4).

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
35
```
**Explanation**: All sticks have the same length of 2. No non-degenerate triangle can be formed, but the problem statement specifies that any three sticks can form a triangle, so the output is the combination of 7 sticks taken 3 at a time.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
4
3 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The sticks have lengths 8, 4, 2, and 8. The possible triangles are (4, 8, 8) and (2, 8, 8).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The sticks have lengths 2, 4, and 8. No non-degenerate triangle can be formed.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There is only one stick, so no triangle can be formed.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There are only two sticks, so no triangle can be formed.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 0 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The sticks have lengths 1, 1, and 8. No non-degenerate triangle can be formed.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
6
0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: All sticks have the same length of 1. No non-degenerate triangle can be formed.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
6
0 1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
20
```
**Explanation**: The sticks have lengths 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32. The possible triangles are (2,4,8), (2,4,16), (2,4,32), (2,8,16), (2,8,32), (2,16,32), (4,8,16), (4,8,32), (4,16,32), (8,16,32), (1,2,4), (1,2,8), (1,2,16), (1,2,32), (1,4,8), (1,4,16), (1,4,32), (1,8,16), (1,8,32), and (1,16,32).

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
**Output**: 
```
120
```
**Explanation**: The sticks have lengths 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512. The possible triangles are numerous, and the output is the combination of 10 sticks taken 3 at a time minus the invalid combinations.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
300000
0 0 0 ... 0 (300000 zeros)
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: All sticks have the same length of 1. No non-degenerate triangle can be formed.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
300000
0 1 2 ... 299999 (all unique values)
```
**Output**: 
```
40499750000
```
**Explanation**: The sticks have lengths 1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^299999. The possible triangles are numerous, and the output is the combination of 300000 sticks taken 3 at a time minus the invalid combinations. This is a stress test to check the scalability of the solution.
