# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 6 78123459896
```
**Output**: 
```
28645268630
```
**Explanation**: The fireworks are visible for 78123459897 minutes. The first installation launches at 5, 10, 15, ..., and the second at 6, 12, 18, ..., etc. The maximum overlap occurs at the least common multiple of 5 and 6, which is 30. The number of fireworks visible at the overlap is calculated based on the visibility period.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The fireworks are visible for 2 minutes. Both installations launch fireworks every minute. The maximum overlap is at every minute where 4 fireworks are visible (two from each installation).

**Explanation**: The fireworks are visible for 1000000000000000001 minutes. Both installations launch fireworks every minute. The maximum overlap is at every minute where 2000000000000000002 fireworks are visible (two from each installation).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
2
2 3 1
2 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
3
4
```
**Explanation**: 
- For the first case, fireworks are visible for 2 minutes. The first installation launches at 2, 4, 6, ..., and the second at 3, 6, 9, ..., etc. The maximum overlap is at 6 minutes where 3 fireworks are visible.
- For the second case, fireworks are visible for 3 minutes. The first installation launches at 2, 4, 6, ..., and the second at 3, 6, 9, ..., etc. The maximum overlap is at 6 minutes where 4 fireworks are visible.

```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The fireworks are visible for 2000000000000000001 minutes. Both installations launch fireworks every 1000000000000000000 minutes. The maximum overlap is at every 1000000000000000000 minutes where 3 fireworks are visible (two from each installation and one overlapping).

# Test 9
