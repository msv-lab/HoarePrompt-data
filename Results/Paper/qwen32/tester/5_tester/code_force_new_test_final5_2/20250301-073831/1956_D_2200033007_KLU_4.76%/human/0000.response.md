Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios:

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
2
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4 1
1 2
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of {0, 1} is 2. Setting both elements to 2 results in the maximum sum of 4.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
3
1 3 9
```
**Output**: 
```
13 0
```
**Explanation**: The initial sum is already the maximum possible sum, so no operations are needed.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
**Explanation**: First, set the third element to 0, then set the third and fourth elements to 2, resulting in the maximum sum of 105.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 1
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of {0} is 1. Setting the single element to 1 results in the maximum sum of 1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0 1
1 1
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of {1} is 0. Setting the single element to 0 results in the maximum sum of 0.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
5
0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
5 1
1 5
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of {0, 0, 0, 0, 0} is 1. Setting all elements to 1 results in the maximum sum of 5.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0 1
1 5
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of {1, 1, 1, 1, 1} is 0. Setting all elements to 0 results in the maximum sum of 0.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
5
0 1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
15 0
```
**Explanation**: The initial sum is already the maximum possible sum, so no operations are needed.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
5
5 5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0 1
1 5
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of {5, 5, 5, 5, 5} is 0. Setting all elements to 0 results in the maximum sum of 0.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
18
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17
```
**Output**: 
```
171 0
```
**Explanation**: The initial sum is already the maximum possible sum, so no operations are needed.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
18
17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
171 0
```
**Explanation**: The initial sum is already the maximum possible sum, so no operations are needed.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
18
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
18 1
1 18
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0} is 1. Setting all elements to 1 results in the maximum sum of 18.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
18
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
```
**Output**: 
```
153 1
1 18
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18} is 0. Setting all elements to 0 results in the maximum sum of 0, but the correct MEX is 18, setting all to 18 results in 153.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
18
1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
9 1
1 18
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of {1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0} is 2. Setting all elements to 2 results in the maximum sum of 9.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
18
9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9
```
**Output**: 
```
0 1
1 18
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of {9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9} is 0. Setting all elements to 0 results in the maximum sum of 0.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including arrays with all identical elements, arrays with elements in ascending or descending order, and arrays with mixed elements. They also test the edge cases where the array length is at its minimum (1) and maximum (18).
