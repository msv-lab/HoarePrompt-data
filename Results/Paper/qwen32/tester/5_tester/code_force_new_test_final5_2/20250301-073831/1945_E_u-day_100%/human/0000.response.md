Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
6 3
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The permutation is already sorted, and 3 is at the correct position.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
6 5
3 1 6 5 2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1
3 4
```
**Explanation**: Swapping elements at positions 3 and 4 makes the permutation [3, 1, 5, 6, 2, 4], and binary search will find 5 correctly.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5 1
3 5 4 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
2 4
1 5
```
**Explanation**: Swapping elements at positions 2 and 4, and then 1 and 5 makes the permutation [1, 2, 4, 5, 3], and binary search will find 1 correctly.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```
**Output**: 
```
2
4 5
1 5
```
**Explanation**: Swapping elements at positions 4 and 5, and then 1 and 5 makes the permutation [2, 3, 1, 5, 4, 6], and binary search will find 3 correctly.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
4 5
2 4
```
**Explanation**: Swapping elements at positions 1 and 2, and then 2 and 3 makes the permutation [2, 3, 1], and binary search will find 2 correctly.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The permutation is trivially sorted, and 1 is at the correct position.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1 2
```
**Explanation**: Swapping elements at positions 1 and 2 makes the permutation [1, 2], and binary search will find 1 correctly.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The permutation is already sorted, and 2 is at the correct position.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
3 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1 3
```
**Explanation**: Swapping elements at positions 1 and 3 makes the permutation [2, 1, 3], and binary search will find 3 correctly.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 100000
100000 99999 99998 ... 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1 2
1 100000
```
**Explanation**: Swapping elements at positions 1 and 2, and then 1 and 100000 makes the permutation [2, 100000, 99999, ..., 3, 1], and binary search will find 100000 correctly.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 1
100000 99999 99998 ... 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1 100000
2 100000
```
**Explanation**: Swapping elements at positions 1 and 100000, and then 2 and 100000 makes the permutation [1, 100000, 99999, ..., 3, 2], and binary search will find 1 correctly.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
2
2 1
2 1
2 2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1 2
0
```
**Explanation**: The first test case requires one swap, and the second test case is already correct.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
3
3 1
3 2 1
3 2
3 2 1
3 3
3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1 3
2 3
2
1 3
2 3
1
1 3
```
**Explanation**: Each test case requires two swaps to sort the permutation and make the binary search find the correct element.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including the simplest cases, larger permutations, and multiple test cases in a single input.
