The code snippet provided initializes a variable `mn` with the value `100`. This change affects the variable `mn` only, while the other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `q`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `mn` and retain the initial conditions for the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; `q` is an input integer; `mn` is 100.**
