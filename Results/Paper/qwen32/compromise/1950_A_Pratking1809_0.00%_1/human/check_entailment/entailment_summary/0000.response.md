Reasoning:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a "stair", a "peak", or neither. The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then checks:
- If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
- If `a < b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
- If neither of the above conditions are met, it prints "NONE".

The execution summary aligns with the program's behavior, and it correctly handles the conditions specified in the problem description. The program also correctly handles the input and output as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
