Correctness: **False**

The provided program has an issue in the else block. The else block is incorrectly placed, which means it will execute whenever the second condition is not met, even if the first condition is true. This will cause the program to print "NONE" when it should print "STAIR". To fix this, you should use elif for the second condition to ensure that it only executes when the first condition is false. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

With this change, the program should work as expected.
