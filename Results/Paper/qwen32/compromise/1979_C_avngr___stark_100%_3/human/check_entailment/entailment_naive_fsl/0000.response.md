Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not implement the solution for the problem described. The code includes two functions (`func_1` and `func_2`), but these functions do not address the problem of distributing the coins such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The code calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers, which is not directly related to the problem requirements. The problem requires finding a valid distribution of bets for each outcome, not calculating the LCM of the multipliers.

To solve the problem, a possible approach would be to find a set of bets that satisfy the conditions. For example, one simple solution is to bet `1` coin on the first outcome and `0` coins on the rest. If this does not satisfy the condition, we can try other distributions.

Here is an example of a correct implementation:

```python
def find_bets(k):
    n = len(k)
    bets = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        bets[i] = 1
        if all(k[j] * bets[j] > sum(bets) for j in range(n)):
            return bets
        bets[i] = 0
    return [-1]

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    t = int(input[0])
    idx = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[idx])
        k = list(map(int, input[idx+1:idx+1+n]))
        idx += 1 + n
        bets = find_bets(k)
        results.append(" ".join(map(str, bets)))
    print("\n".join(results))

# Example usage:
# main()
```

This code attempts to find a valid distribution of bets by setting each bet to `1` one by one and checking if the conditions are met. If no valid distribution is found, it returns `-1`.

Since the provided code does not implement the required functionality, it is incorrect.
