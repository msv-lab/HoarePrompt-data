The only variable in the loop head is `num`, and it is being iterated over the slice `numbers[1:]` of the list `numbers`. Therefore, we need to adjust `num` to the next element in the list `numbers` for the next iteration of the loop. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is the current element being processed, and `result` is the output of `func_1(result, num)`. For the next iteration, `num` should be the next element in the list `numbers` after the current `num`.

Given that `numbers` is a list of integers with at least two elements, and `num` is the next element in `numbers` after the current `num`, we need to adjust `num` to the subsequent element in the list.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `result` is the output of `func_1(result, num)`; `num` is the next element in `numbers` after the current `num`**.

To be more specific, if `num` was the second element in the list during the previous iteration, it should now be the third element for the next iteration. If `num` was the third element, it should now be the fourth, and so on.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `result` is the output of `func_1(result, num)`; `num` is the next element in `numbers` after the current `num`**.

Since we are only adjusting `num` and it is determined by the iteration over `numbers[1:]`, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `result` is the output of `func_1(result, num)`; `num` is the next element in `numbers` after the current `num`**.

For a more concrete example, if `numbers` was `[a, b, c, d]` and during the previous iteration `num` was `b`, then for the next iteration `num` should be `c`.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `result` is the output of `func_1(result, num)`; `num` is the next element in `numbers` after the current `num`**.

So the final state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `result` is the output of `func_1(result, num)`; `num` is the next element in `numbers` after the current `num`**.
