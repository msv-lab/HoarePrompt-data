To determine the output state, we need to understand the function `func_1` and how it affects the variables. However, since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we can only describe the change in terms of the function's output.

Given:
- `numbers` is a list of integers with at least two elements.
- `result` is initially the first element of `numbers`.

The code snippet:
```
result = func_1(result, num)
```

Assume `num` is a variable that holds a value, possibly from the list `numbers` or another source. Since `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `result` after the function call. However, we can describe the state in terms of the function's output.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `result` is the output of `func_1(result, num)`**.

In natural language, this means that after the function `func_1` is called with `result` and `num` as arguments, `result` will hold the value returned by `func_1`. The list `numbers` remains unchanged.
