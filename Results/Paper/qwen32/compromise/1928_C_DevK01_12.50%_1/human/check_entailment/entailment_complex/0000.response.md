### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is structured to solve the problem by iterating through multiple test cases and determining the number of valid `k` values for each case based on the given conditions. However, there are several issues in the code that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Parameter Handling in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to take two parameters: `q` and `x`. However, in the context of the program, `q` is being passed as `(y - 2) // 2` or `(n - x) // 2`, which are integers, not a list of tuples as mentioned in the comment.
   - The comment incorrectly states that `q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x`. This is not the case in the actual function call.

2. **Incorrect Handling of the Square Root:**
   - The code attempts to compute the square root of `q` using `math.sqrt(q)`. If `q` is an integer, this operation is valid. However, if `q` were a list (as incorrectly stated in the comment), this would raise a `TypeError`.

3. **Logic for Divisor Collection:**
   - The logic for collecting divisors of `q` is correct in the sense that it checks divisors up to the square root of `q` and adds them to the list `M` if they meet the condition `i >= x - 1`. However, the context in which `q` is used is incorrect due to the earlier mentioned issues.

4. **Incorrect Handling of `n >= 3 * x - 2`:**
   - The logic to add additional divisors when `n >= 3 * x - 2` is correct, but it relies on the correct handling of `q` as an integer.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The final output is the length of the unique divisors collected in `M`. However, due to the incorrect handling of `q` as a list instead of an integer, the program would not work as intended.

### Correctness:

Given the issues outlined above, the program is incorrect due to the incorrect handling of the parameter `q` in the function `func_1`.

**Correctness: False**
