You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = L[0]
    x = L[1]
    ans = 0
    y = n + x
    if y % 2 != 0:
        print(0)
        continue
    else:
        L1 = func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)
        if n >= 3 * x - 2:
            L1 += func_1((n - x) // 2, x)
        L1 = list(set(L1))
        print(len(L1))
        continue

def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1:
        M += [w]
    for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M += [i]
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M += [q // i]
    return M



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of tuples `q`, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ `x` < `n` ≤ 10^9, and an integer `x`. It returns a list `M` containing the divisors of `n` from each tuple in `q` that are greater than or equal to `x`. However, due to an error in the code, the function will raise a `TypeError` when attempting to compute the square root of `q`, which is a list instead of a number.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step by step to determine if the given program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Understanding the Settling Process**:
   - The sequence of numbers repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - The first `k` numbers are `1, 2, 3, ..., k`.
   - The next `k - 2` numbers are `k-1, k-2, ..., 2`.
   - This pattern repeats.

2. **Objective**:
   - Given Vasya's position `n` and the number `x` he received, find all possible values of `k` that could generate this sequence.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - For a given `k`, Vasya's position `n` and number `x` must satisfy the sequence pattern.
   - The sequence length is `2k - 2`, so `n` must fit within these cycles.
   - The value of `x` within a cycle depends on the position `n` modulo `2k - 2`.

### Code Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`.
   - If `y` is odd, the program immediately prints `0` because the sequence length `2k - 2` must be even.
   - If `y` is even, the program calls `func_1` to find possible `k` values.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it calls `func_1` again with a different argument.
   - The results from `func_1` are combined, duplicates are removed, and the length of the resulting list is printed.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function finds divisors of `q` that are at least `x - 1`.
   - It includes both the divisor and its complement if they are valid.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding `k`**:
   - The logic for finding `k` is not directly related to the sequence pattern described in the problem.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to find divisors of `q` that fit the pattern, but it does not consider the position `n` within the sequence cycle.

2. **Incorrect Handling of `n` and `x`**:
   - The program does not correctly map the position `n` and number `x` to the sequence pattern.
   - It does not consider the cycle length `2k - 2` and how `n` fits within these cycles.

3. **Incorrect Use of `y`**:
   - The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`, but it is not clear how this value is used to determine `k`.
   - The condition `y % 2 != 0` is correct for ensuring the sequence length is even, but the subsequent logic is flawed.

### Correctness

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find all possible values of `k` based on the given position `n` and number `x`.

**Correctness: False**

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly determine the number of possible `k` values that fit the given constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
