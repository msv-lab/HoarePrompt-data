Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state provided.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers read from the input and split into their respective variables.
- The value of `a` is dependent on the value of `x` relative to `k - 1` and follows specific conditions:
  - If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then `a` is either greater than or equal to `x + 1` or less than `x + 1`.
  - If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, then `a` is either greater than or equal to `x + 3` or less than `x + 3`.
  - If `x` is greater than `k - 1`, `z` is calculated by iterating the formula \( z = z + \left(\frac{z}{k - 1}\right) + 1 \) for `x + 1` times, and `a` is either greater than or equal to the final value of `z` or less than the final value of `z`.
- The program does not change the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, or `z` based on the given conditions.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, or `z`. The statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

### Output:
Since the `print` statement is fixed and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state, the output will always be `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
