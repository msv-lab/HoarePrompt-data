The given code snippet is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This print statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variables, conditions, or calculations described in the initial state. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided and will be printed as is.

Hereâ€™s the breakdown:
- The initial state describes conditions and calculations for variables `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `z`, but these variables are not used in the print statement.
- The print statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **YES**
