Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers read from the input and split into their respective variables. The current value of `x` is less than `k - 1`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, then the condition `a >= x + 1` holds. Otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 1`.**
