Given the initial state, we have the following conditions:

- `t` is an integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers read from the input.
- `z` is defined as:
  - `x + 1` if `k > 2`
  - \(2^{(x+1)} - 1\) if `k = 2`
- The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z`.

The code snippet provided is:
```
print('YES')
```

The `print` statement in the code snippet does not depend on the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, or `z`. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **YES**
