### Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules described. The logic in the `func_1` function is flawed and does not align with the game's mechanics.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Initial Check for `set_[0] != 1`:**
   - The function checks if the smallest pile has more than 1 stone. If true, it immediately returns 'Alice'. This is incorrect because the game does not depend solely on the smallest pile's size. The game's outcome depends on the configuration of all piles, not just the smallest one.

2. **Checking Consecutive Values:**
   - The function checks if all unique pile sizes are consecutive. If they are, it toggles the value of `A` based on the count of unique pile sizes. This logic is not related to the game's rules. The game is about the parity of the Grundy numbers (or Nimbers) of the piles, which is a concept from combinatorial game theory.

3. **Grundy Number Concept:**
   - The correct approach to determine the winner is to calculate the Grundy number for each pile and then XOR all the Grundy numbers. If the result is non-zero, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. The Grundy number for a pile with `x` stones is `x` itself in this game because each move reduces all piles by the same number of stones.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect because it does not implement the correct logic for determining the winner based on the game's rules.

**Correctness: **False**
