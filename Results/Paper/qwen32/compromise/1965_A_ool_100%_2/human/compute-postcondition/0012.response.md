To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the conditions and values of the variables `A` and `not_c`.

1. `A` is initially set to `True` if the number of unique elements in `set_` (excluding the first element) is even, otherwise `False`.
2. `not_c` is `True` if all elements in `set_` are consecutive, otherwise `False`.
3. If `not_c` is `True`, then `A` is negated.

The final return value depends on the value of `A` after these evaluations.

Output State: **The program returns 'Alice' if A is True else 'Bob'**

To provide a more specific output state, we need to consider the possible values of `A` after the evaluation of `not_c`:

- If `not_c` is `True`, `A` is flipped. So if `A` was initially `True`, it becomes `False`, and vice versa.
- If `not_c` is `False`, `A` remains unchanged.

Since we don't have specific values for `set_`, we can't definitively say whether `A` is `True` or `False` before the evaluation of `not_c`. However, we can describe the final output based on the described logic.

Output State: **The program returns 'Alice' if the final value of A is True, otherwise it returns 'Bob'**
