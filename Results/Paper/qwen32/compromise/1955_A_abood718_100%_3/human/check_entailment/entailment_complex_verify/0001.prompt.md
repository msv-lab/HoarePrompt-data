You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three integers n, a, and b where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three integers n, a, and b where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on specific conditions related to the input integers.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given the number of yogurts `n` Maxim wants to buy.
   - We are also given the price `a` of one yogurt and the price `b` of two yogurts during the promotion.
   - The goal is to find the minimum cost to buy exactly `n` yogurts.

2. **Logic to Find Minimum Cost:**
   - **Case 1:** If the cost of buying two yogurts at the regular price (2*a) is less than the promotion price (b), then it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually. The total cost is `n * a`.
   - **Case 2:** If the cost of buying two yogurts during the promotion (b) is cheaper or equal to the cost of buying two yogurts individually (2*a), then:
     - If `n` is even, Maxim can buy all yogurts in pairs, and the total cost is `(n/2) * b`.
     - If `n` is odd, Maxim can buy `(n-1)` yogurts in pairs (which costs `((n-1)/2) * b`) and buy the remaining one yogurt individually (which costs `a`). The total cost is `(((n-1)/2) * b) + a`.

### Program Analysis

Let's analyze the provided program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

- **Input Parsing:**
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the values `n`, `a`, and `b`.

- **Logic Implementation:**
  - **Case 1:** If `2*a < b`, it correctly calculates the cost as `n * a`.
  - **Case 2:** 
    - If `n` is even (`A % 2 == 0`), it correctly calculates the cost as `(n/2) * b`.
    - If `n` is odd, it calculates the cost as `(n//2) * b + a`. However, the variable names are a bit misleading. Here, `A` stands for `n`, `B` stands for `a`, and `C` stands for `b`. So, the cost should be `(A // 2) * C + B`, which is correctly implemented.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.
