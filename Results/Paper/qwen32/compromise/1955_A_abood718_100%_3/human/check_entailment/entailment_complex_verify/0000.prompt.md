You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three integers n, a, and b where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():

        elif A % 2 == 0:

        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three integers n, a, and b where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on specific conditions related to the input integers.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the problem requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective**: Determine the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts.
- **Prices**:
  - One yogurt costs `a` burles.
  - Two yogurts cost `b` burles (promotion price).
- **Input**:
  - Number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- **Output**:
  - Minimum cost for each test case.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it calculates the minimum cost based on the following logic:
1. If the cost of two yogurts (`b`) is greater than or equal to twice the cost of one yogurt (`2 * a`), then it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually. The cost is `n * a`.
2. If `n` is even, the cost is simply `(n / 2) * b`.
3. If `n` is odd, the cost is `((n - 1) / 2) * b + a` (buying `n - 1` yogurts in pairs and the last one individually).

### Code Review:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

### Issues:
- The condition `if B * 2 < C` is incorrect. It should be `if B * 2 <= C` to correctly handle the case where buying two yogurts at the promotion price is as cheap or cheaper than buying them individually.
- The logic for handling odd `n` is correct, but the logic for handling even `n` and the condition check need to be corrected.

### Corrected Logic:
1. If `b <= 2 * a`, it's cheaper to buy two yogurts at the promotion price.
2. Calculate the number of pairs (`n // 2`) and the remaining yogurts (`n % 2`).
3. The cost is `(n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        pairs = n // 2
        remaining = n % 2
        if b <= 2 * a:
            print(pairs * b + remaining * a)
        else:
            print(n * a)

```

### Conclusion:
The original program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it does not correctly compare the cost of buying two yogurts at the promotion price versus individually when `b` is exactly twice `a`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The original program incorrectly compares the cost of buying two yogurts at the promotion price versus individually when `b` is exactly twice `a`. The condition `if B * 2 < C` should be `if B * 2 <= C` to handle this edge case correctly.
