### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts under the promotion rules provided. Let's break down the logic of the program and compare it with the problem requirements.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts under promotion).

2. **Logic for Minimum Cost:**
   - The program uses the following logic to determine the minimum cost:
     - If buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than the promotion price (`b`), then it's better to buy all yogurts individually. The cost would be `n * a`.
     - If `n` is even and buying two yogurts under promotion is cheaper or equal in price to buying them individually, then it's better to buy all yogurts in pairs. The cost would be `(n / 2) * b`.
     - If `n` is odd, the program calculates the cost by buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible and then buying the remaining yogurt individually. The cost would be `(n // 2) * b + a`.

3. **Implementation Details:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where buying two yogurts individually is cheaper by checking `if B * 2 < C`.
   - It also correctly handles the case where `n` is even and the promotion price is cheaper or equal by checking `elif A % 2 == 0`.
   - For odd `n`, the program correctly calculates the cost as `(A // 2) * C + B`.

### Comparison with Example:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - Since `5 * 2 < 9` is false and `2 % 2 == 0` is true, the cost is `(2 / 2) * 9 = 9`.
   - Output: `9` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - Since `5 * 2 < 9` is false and `3 % 2 == 0` is false, the cost is `(3 // 2) * 9 + 5 = 14`.
   - Output: `14` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - Since `5 * 2 < 11` is true, the cost is `3 * 5 = 15`.
   - Output: `15` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - Since `5 * 2 < 11` is true, the cost is `4 * 5 = 20`.
   - Output: `20` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts given the promotion rules. It handles all edge cases and the provided example inputs correctly.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
