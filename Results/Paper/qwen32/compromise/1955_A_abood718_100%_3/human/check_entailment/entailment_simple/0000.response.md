Reasoning: 
The provided program aims to determine the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy `n` yogurts given the price `a` for one yogurt and the price `b` for two yogurts on promotion. Let's analyze the logic of the program:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cost Calculation**:
   - **Condition 1**: If `b * 2 < a`, the program prints `n * a`. However, this condition seems incorrect because it would mean buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than the promotion, which contradicts the problem's premise. The correct condition should be `b < a * 2` to check if the promotion price is cheaper than buying two yogurts individually.
   - **Condition 2**: If `n % 2 == 0`, the program prints `int(n * b / 2)`. This is correct because if `n` is even, you can buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price.
   - **Condition 3**: If `n` is odd, the program calculates the number of pairs `X = n // 2` and then prints `X * b + a` (the cost of the pairs plus the cost of the remaining single yogurt). This is also correct.

However, the first condition in the code is incorrect. It should be `if b < a * 2:` instead of `if b * 2 < a:` to correctly determine when the promotion is cheaper. Given the incorrect condition, the program might not always output the correct minimum cost.

Given the incorrect condition, the program is not correct for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
