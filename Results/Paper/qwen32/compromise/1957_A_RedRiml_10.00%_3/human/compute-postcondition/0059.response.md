The code appends the current value of `i` to the list `pl`. This means that the length of `pl` increases by one, and the last element of `pl` is now `i`.

No other variables are explicitly modified by this line of code, so their values remain unchanged. Specifically, `shapes`, `w`, `ln`, `palka`, and `i` retain their previous values.

Output State: **`shapes` is the total number of unique elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d` (updated if `i`'s count became 3 or more); `w` is incremented by 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element; `i` is the next element in `palka`; `pl` has had `i` appended to it.**
