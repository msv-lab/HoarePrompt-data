The code snippet `pl.append(i)` adds the current element `i` to the list `pl`. This means that if `i` was not already in `pl`, it will now be included, and if it was already in `pl`, it will be added again.

Here's the updated state of the variables:
- `palka` remains unchanged as a list of integers from the input.
- `w` remains unchanged as the length of `palka` minus 1.
- `pl` now includes the new element `i`.
- `d` might be updated depending on whether `i` was already in `d` or not. If `i` was not in `d`, `d[i]` is set to 1. If `i` was already in `d`, `d[i]` is incremented by 1.
- `shapes` might be updated if the addition of `i` causes a unique element in `pl` to appear at least 3 times in `palka`.
- `ln` remains unchanged as an input integer.
- `i` remains unchanged as the next element in `palka`.

Given these changes, the output state is:

Output State: **`palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one element; `w` is the length of `palka` minus 1; `pl` is a list that contains the element `i` (added if it was not previously in `pl`); `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is `1` if `i` was not previously in `d` or incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `d`; `shapes` is the number of unique elements in the previous `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka` (updated if necessary); `ln` is an input integer; `i` is the next element in `palka`.**
