To determine what will be printed by the `print(shapes)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

- `w` is the length of `palka`. This tells us how many elements are in the list `palka`.
- `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka`. This means `pl` contains no duplicates and includes every distinct element found in `palka`.
- `d` is a dictionary with counts of each element in `palka`. Each key in this dictionary corresponds to a unique element from `palka`, and the value associated with each key is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`.
- `shapes` is the number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`. This means `shapes` is counting how many different elements in `palka` have a count of 3 or more in the dictionary `d`.

Given these definitions, the `print(shapes)` statement will output the number of unique elements in `palka` that have a frequency of at least 3.

Since the specific contents of `palka` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `shapes`. However, we can describe it precisely based on the information given.

Output: **shapes (where shapes is the number of unique elements in `palka` that appear at least 3 times)**
