The code assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. Since the initial state specifies that `d.get(i)` is `None`, it implies that `i` was not previously a key in `d`. After the assignment, `d[i]` will be `1`.

The other variables (`palka`, `w`, `pl`, `shapes`, and `ln`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one element, `w` is the length of `palka` minus 1, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with `d[i]` equal to `1`, `shapes` is the number of unique elements in the previous `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`, `ln` is an input integer.**
