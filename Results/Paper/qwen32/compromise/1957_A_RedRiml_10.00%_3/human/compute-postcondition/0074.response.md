Output State: **`w` is the length of `palka`, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` that must have at least 2 elements, `d` is a dictionary with counts of each element in `palka`. If there exists an element `j` in `d` such that the count of `j` in `d` is greater than or equal to 3, then `shapes` is 2. Otherwise, `shapes` is 1. `j` is the second element of `pl`.**

Explanation: The value of `shapes` is incremented by 1. If `shapes` was initially 0 (because no element in `d` had a count of 3 or more), it becomes 1. If `shapes` was initially 1 (because there was at least one element in `d` with a count of 3 or more), it becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
