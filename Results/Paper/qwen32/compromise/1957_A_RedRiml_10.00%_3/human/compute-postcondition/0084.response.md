The code snippet `pl = []` reassigns the variable `pl` to an empty list. This means that the previous list of unique elements from `palka` is discarded, and `pl` now holds no elements.

Other variables remain unchanged:
- `palka` is still a list of integers from the input.
- `w` is still the length of `palka` minus 1.
- `d` is still a dictionary with counts of each element in `palka`.
- `shapes` is still the number of unique elements in `pl` (which was previously a list of unique elements from `palka`) that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.
- `ln` is still an input integer.

Output State: **`palka` is a list of integers from the input, `w` is the length of `palka` minus 1, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with counts of each element in `palka`, `shapes` is the number of unique elements in the previous `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`, `ln` is an input integer.**
