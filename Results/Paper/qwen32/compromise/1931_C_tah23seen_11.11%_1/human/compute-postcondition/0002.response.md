To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to ensure that the condition `i <= j` is satisfied. 

Let's analyze the given state:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= n`, and the length of `arr` (n) satisfies `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is `len(arr) - 1`.

The loop condition is `i <= j`.

Given that `i` is 0, for the loop to execute, `j` must be at least 0. Since `j` is defined as `len(arr) - 1`, this means that `len(arr)` must be at least 1 for `j` to be 0 or greater.

Therefore, the only requirement is that `arr` should not be an empty list. If `arr` has at least one element, `j` will be 0, and the condition `i <= j` will be satisfied.

No other states need to be adjusted since the condition only depends on `i` and `j`, and `i` is already 0.

State: **`arr` must have at least one element, `i` is 0, `j` is len(arr) - 1**
