Let's break down the provided Python program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Program Explanation:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads a single line of input which is the balanced parentheses sequence.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1(s)` is called with the input string `s`.
   - `n` is assigned the length of the string `s`.
   - `ans` is initialized as an empty string, which will be used to build the final result.
   - A dictionary `d` is initialized with the key-value pair `{0: 0}`. This dictionary will store the balance of the prefix at each position.
   - The program then iterates through each character in the string `s`:
     - If the character is `'('`, it increments the balance by 1.
     - If the character is `')'`, it decrements the balance by 1.
     - The balance at each position `i + 1` is stored in the dictionary `d`.
   - The entry for the last position `n` is removed from the dictionary `d` using `d.pop(n)`. This is unnecessary because the balance at the last position is not needed for the final result.
   - The dictionary `d` is then sorted by the balance values in ascending order. If two balances are the same, the positions are sorted in descending order.
   - The characters from the original string `s` are appended to `ans` in the order determined by the sorted dictionary `d`.

3. **Output:**
   - The final result `ans` is printed, which is the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

### Correctness Analysis:

- The program correctly computes the balance of the prefix at each position.
- The sorting step ensures that the characters are rearranged according to the rules defined in the problem statement.
- The removal of the last balance entry is not necessary for correctness but does not affect the result.
- The program handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem description.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program, it appears that it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
