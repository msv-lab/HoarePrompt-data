Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000. The function returns `ans`, which is likely an integer representing some property or characteristic of the balanced parentheses sequence, such as the maximum depth of nested parentheses or the length of the longest valid subsequence.**
