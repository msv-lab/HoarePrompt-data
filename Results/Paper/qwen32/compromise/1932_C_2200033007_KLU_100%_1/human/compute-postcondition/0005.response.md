Output State: **`b` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= b_i <= 10^4, arranged according to the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in the string `s`; `l` is the number of 'L' characters encountered in `s`; `r` is `n - 1` minus the number of 'R' characters encountered in `s`; `ans` is an empty list.**

Natural Language: The list `b`, the count `l` of 'L' characters, and the derived count `r` of effectively non-'R' characters (adjusted by `n - 1`) remain unchanged. The new variable `ans` is initialized as an empty list.
