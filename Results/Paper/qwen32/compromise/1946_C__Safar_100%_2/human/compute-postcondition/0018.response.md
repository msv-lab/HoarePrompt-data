Postcondition: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree with `n` vertices such that `g[1]` contains at least one neighbor, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k < n`. If `node` is not equal to `p`, `stack` is `[(1, 1), (node, x)]`; otherwise, `stack` remains `[(1, 1)]`. `visited` is `{1}`, `d` is `{1: 1}`, `r` is `0`, `x` is `1`, `p` is `1`, and `node` is the next element in `g[1]` after the current `node`.**
