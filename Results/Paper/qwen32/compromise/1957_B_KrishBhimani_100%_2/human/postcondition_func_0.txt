The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it computes a specific list of integers based on the values of `n` and `k`, and prints this list. If `n` is 1, it simply prints `k`. Otherwise, it constructs a list starting with the largest power of 2 minus one that is less than `k`, followed by the remainder when `k` is subtracted by the sum of the list so far, and fills the rest of the list with zeros to ensure its length is `n`.
