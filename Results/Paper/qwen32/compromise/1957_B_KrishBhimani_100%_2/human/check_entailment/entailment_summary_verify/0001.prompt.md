You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        if n == 1:
            print(k)
        else:
            arr = []
            k0 = k
            i = 0
            ans = []
            temp = 1
            while True:
                if temp * 2 < k:
                    temp *= 2
                    i += 1
                else:
                    break
            ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
            ans.append(k - sum(ans))
            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
            print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it computes a specific list of integers based on the values of `n` and `k`, and prints this list. If `n` is 1, it simply prints `k`. Otherwise, it constructs a list starting with the largest power of 2 minus one that is less than `k`, followed by the remainder when `k` is subtracted by the sum of the list so far, and fills the rest of the list with zeros to ensure its length is `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap
We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers whose sum equals `k`, and the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers should be maximized.

### Program Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Handling Single Element Case (`n == 1`):**
   - If `n == 1`, the program simply prints `k`. This is correct because there is only one element, and it must be equal to `k`.

3. **General Case (`n > 1`):**
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` and sets `k0` to `k`.
   - It then enters a loop to find the largest power of 2 less than `k`. This is done by doubling `temp` until `temp * 2 >= k`.
   - After exiting the loop, `temp` holds the largest power of 2 less than `k`.
   - The program appends `(1 << i) - 1` to `ans`, where `i` is the exponent of the largest power of 2 found. This value is the largest number with `i + 1` bits set to 1.
   - It then appends `k - sum(ans)` to `ans` to ensure the sum of the elements equals `k`.
   - Finally, it appends zeros to `ans` to make its length equal to `n` and prints the sequence.

### Issues in the Program

- **Maximizing the Number of 1s in Bitwise OR:**
  - The current approach does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.
  - The program only considers one large number with many 1s in its binary representation and fills the rest with zeros. This might not be optimal.
  - For example, consider `n = 3` and `k = 5`. The program might output `[3, 2, 0]` (where `3` is `11` in binary and `2` is `10`), resulting in `3 | 2 = 11` (two 1s). However, a better solution would be `[1, 1, 3]` (where `1` is `01` and `3` is `11`), resulting in `1 | 1 | 3 = 11` (two 1s), but another optimal solution could be `[1, 1, 1, 2]` which is not possible here due to `n=3`, but `[1, 1, 3]` is still better than `[3, 2, 0]` in terms of maximizing 1s in OR for this specific case.
  - The optimal strategy would involve distributing the sum `k` across multiple numbers in a way that maximizes the number of 1s in their bitwise OR.

### Conclusion

The program does not guarantee that the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized, especially for larger values of `n` and `k`. Therefore, the program is incorrect based on the problem's requirements.
