Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings obtained from the new input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`; If `n` equals 1, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `temp * 2` is less than `k` or not; `temp` is multiplied by 2.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `temp` is now doubled. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
