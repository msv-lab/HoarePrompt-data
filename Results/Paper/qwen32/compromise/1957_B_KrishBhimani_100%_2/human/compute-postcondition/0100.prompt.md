Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each of the next t lines contains two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l1 = input().split()
    n, k = list(map(int, l1))
    if n == 1:
        print(k)
    else:
        arr = []
        k0 = k
        i = 0
        ans = []
        temp = 1
        while True:
            if temp * 2 < k:
                temp *= 2
                i += 1
            else:
                break
        ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
        ans.append(k - sum(ans))
        ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
        print(*ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained from the input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`. If `n` equals 1, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing `n` elements where the first two elements are `[(1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1)]` and the remaining `n - 2` elements are `0`; `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became not less than `k`; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is still less than `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings obtained from the new input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`. If `n` equals 1, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is a list of length `n` where the first two elements are `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`, and the remaining elements are zeros; `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became greater than or equal to `k`; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings obtained from the new input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`. If `n` equals 1, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is a list of length `n` where the first two elements are `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`, and the remaining elements are zeros; `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became greater than or equal to `k`; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
