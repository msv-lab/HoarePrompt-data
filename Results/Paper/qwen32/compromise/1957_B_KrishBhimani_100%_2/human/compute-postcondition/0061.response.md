To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses and when it terminates. The loop continues to execute as long as `temp * 2` is less than `k`. Each iteration doubles the value of `temp` and increments `i` by 1 until `temp * 2` is no longer less than `k`.

Let's analyze the loop step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `temp` starts at 1.
   - `i` starts at 0.

2. **First Iteration**:
   - If `temp * 2 < k` (i.e., `2 < k`), then `temp` becomes `2` and `i` becomes `1`.
   - If `temp * 2 >= k`, the loop breaks.

3. **Second Iteration**:
   - If `temp * 2 < k` (i.e., `4 < k`), then `temp` becomes `4` and `i` becomes `2`.
   - If `temp * 2 >= k`, the loop breaks.

4. **Third Iteration**:
   - If `temp * 2 < k` (i.e., `8 < k`), then `temp` becomes `8` and `i` becomes `3`.
   - If `temp * 2 >= k`, the loop breaks.

The loop will continue doubling `temp` and incrementing `i` until `temp * 2` is no longer less than `k`. At this point, `temp` will be the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`, and `i` will reflect the number of doublings performed.

### Final Output State:
- `t`: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `l1`: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `n`: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `k`: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `k0`: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `arr`: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `ans`: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `i`: Will be the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became greater than or equal to `k`.
- `temp`: Will be the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.

In natural language, the final output state means that `temp` will be the highest power of 2 that is still less than `k`, and `i` will indicate how many times `temp` was doubled to reach this value. All other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `arr`, `ans`) remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings obtained from the new input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`; If `n` equals 1, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became greater than or equal to `k`; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.**
