The given code snippet updates the `l1` variable by reading a new line of input and splitting it by whitespace. This means that `l1` will now hold the new list of substrings from the input.

Since the input operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `ans`, `i`, or `temp`, these variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings obtained from the new input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`. If `n` equals 1, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is a list of length `n` where the first two elements are `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`, and the remaining elements are zeros; `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became greater than or equal to `k`; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.**
