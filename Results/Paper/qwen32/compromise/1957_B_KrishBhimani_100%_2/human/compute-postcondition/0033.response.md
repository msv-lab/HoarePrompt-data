To determine the output of the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the `ans` list step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable does not directly influence the `ans` list or the print statement, so it can be ignored for this specific task.
   
2. **`l1`**: A list of substrings obtained from the input line split by whitespace. It contains at least two elements: `n` and `k`.

3. **`n`**: The integer value of the first element of `l1`. It represents the number of elements in the `ans` list and is not equal to 1.

4. **`k`**: The integer value of the second element of `l1`. It is used to calculate the first two elements of the `ans` list.

5. **`arr`**: An empty list. It is not used in the construction of the `ans` list or the print statement.

6. **`k0`**: Equal to `k`. This variable is also not used in the construction of the `ans` list or the print statement.

7. **`ans`**: A list containing `n` elements:
   - The first element is \((1 << i) - 1\), where `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became not less than `k`.
   - The second element is \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\).
   - The remaining \(n - 2\) elements are `0`.

8. **`i`**: The number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became not less than `k`.

9. **`temp`**: The largest power of 2 that is still less than `k`.

### Construction of `ans` List:

- **Finding `i` and `temp`**:
  - Start with `temp = 1` (which is \(2^0\)).
  - Double `temp` until `temp * 2` is no longer less than `k`.
  - Each time `temp` is doubled, increment `i`.

- **Calculating the First Element of `ans`**:
  - The first element is \((1 << i) - 1\), which is equivalent to \(2^i - 1\).

- **Calculating the Second Element of `ans`**:
  - The second element is \(k - (2^i - 1)\).

- **Remaining Elements of `ans`**:
  - All remaining elements (from index 2 to \(n-1\)) are set to `0`.

### Example Calculation:

Let's assume `n = 5` and `k = 10` for illustration:

1. **Determine `i` and `temp`**:
   - Start with `temp = 1` and `i = 0`.
   - Double `temp`:
     - `temp = 2`, `i = 1` (since \(2 < 10\))
     - `temp = 4`, `i = 2` (since \(4 < 10\))
     - `temp = 8`, `i = 3` (since \(8 < 10\))
     - `temp = 16`, `i = 4` (but \(16 \geq 10\), so stop here)

2. **Calculate the First Element**:
   - First element = \((1 << 3) - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7\).

3. **Calculate the Second Element**:
   - Second element = \(10 - 7 = 3\).

4. **Construct the `ans` List**:
   - `ans = [7, 3, 0, 0, 0]` (since \(n = 5\)).

### Final Output:

Given the above steps, the `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list separated by spaces.

Output: **7 3 0 0 0 (where the first element is \(2^i - 1\), the second element is \(k - (2^i - 1)\), and the remaining \(n - 2\) elements are 0)**

This format ensures that the output is described precisely based on the given initial state.
