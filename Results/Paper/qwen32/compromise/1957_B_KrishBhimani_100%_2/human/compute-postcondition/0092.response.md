Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings obtained from the new input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`; If `n` equals 1, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `temp * 2` is less than `k`; `temp` is either 1 or 4 if `temp * 2` is less than `k`, otherwise `temp` is 2; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only terminates the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
