Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained from the input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `n` is not equal to 1; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the new `temp` is less than `k` or not; `temp` is either 2, 4, or 8. If the new `temp` is less than `k`, then `i` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` was initially 0, it becomes 1. If `i` was initially 1, it becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
