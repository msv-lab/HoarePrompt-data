The code snippet `temp *= 2` doubles the value of `temp`. Based on the initial state, `temp` can be 1, 2, or 4. After executing `temp *= 2`, the new value of `temp` will be 2, 4, or 8 respectively.

Given the conditions:
- If `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `i` is set to 1 and `temp` is doubled.
- If `temp * 2` is not less than `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Since `temp` is doubled, we need to check if the new value of `temp` is less than `k` to determine the value of `i`.

Let's consider the possible values of `temp` after doubling:
- If `temp` was 1, it becomes 2.
- If `temp` was 2, it becomes 4.
- If `temp` was 4, it becomes 8.

The value of `i` will be updated to 1 only if the new value of `temp` is less than `k`. Otherwise, `i` remains unchanged (which could be 0 or 1 based on the initial condition).

However, since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we cannot definitively say whether `i` will be 0 or 1 after the operation. We can only specify the new value of `temp` and the condition under which `i` would change.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained from the input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `n` is not equal to 1; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the new `temp` is less than `k` or not; `temp` is either 2, 4, or 8. If the new `temp` is less than `k`, then `i` is 1. Otherwise, `i` remains unchanged.**
