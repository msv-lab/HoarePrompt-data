To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop operates and when it terminates. The loop continues to double the value of `temp` until `temp * 2` is no longer less than `k`. At that point, the loop breaks.

Let's break down the loop behavior:

- Initially, `temp` is set to 1.
- In each iteration, `temp` is doubled if `temp * 2 < k`.
- The loop increments `i` each time `temp` is doubled.
- The loop terminates when `temp * 2` is no longer less than `k`.

Given this, the final state will be when `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is still less than `k`. Let's denote this final value of `temp` as `2^m` where `2^m < k` and `2^(m+1) >= k`. The value of `i` will be `m`, representing the number of times `temp` was doubled.

Therefore, the final output state will be:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `l1` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `k` remains unchanged.
- `k0` remains unchanged.
- `ans` remains unchanged.
- `arr` remains unchanged.
- `i` will be the number of times `temp` was doubled before the loop terminated.
- `temp` will be the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings obtained from the new input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`; If `n` equals 1, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before the loop terminated; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `temp` will be the highest power of 2 that is still smaller than `k`, and `i` will be the count of how many times `temp` was doubled to reach that value. All other variables remain unchanged.
