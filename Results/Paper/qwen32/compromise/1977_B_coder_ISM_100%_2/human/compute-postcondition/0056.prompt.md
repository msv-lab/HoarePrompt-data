Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an integer read from the input; `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each either the string `'1'` or the string `'0'`, representing the binary digits of `x` starting from the least significant bit (rightmost) to the most significant bit (leftmost); `length` is 30; `flag` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an integer read from the input; `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each either the string `'1'` or the string `'0'`; `length` is 30; `flag` is either 0 or 1. If `flag` was 0 and `s[i]` was `'1'` and `s[i + 1]` was also `'1'`, then `s[i]` is changed to `'-1'` and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1, then `s[i]` is specifically set to `'0'`. Additionally, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not `'1'`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an integer read from the input; `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each either the string `'1'` or the string `'0'`; `length` is 30; `flag` is either 0 or 1; `i` is 28. If `flag` was 1 and `s[28]` was `'0'`, then `s[28]` is now `'1'` and `flag` is now 0. Otherwise, `s` and `flag` remain unchanged. Additionally, if `flag` is 0 and `s[28]` is `'1'` and `s[29]` is `'1'`, then no changes occur to `s` or `flag`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an integer read from the input; `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each either the string `'1'` or the string `'0'`; `length` is 30; `flag` is either 0 or 1; `i` is 29. If `flag` was 1 and the 30th element of `s` was `'0'`, then the 30th element of `s` is changed to `'1'` and `flag` is set to 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to `s` or `flag`. Additionally, if `flag` is 0, `s[i]` equals `s[i + 1]`, and both are `'1'`, no changes are made to `s` or `flag`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
