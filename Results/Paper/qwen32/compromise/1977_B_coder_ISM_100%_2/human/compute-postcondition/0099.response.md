Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `x` is a new integer read from the input; `s` is a list containing either `['1', '1', '1']`, `['0', '1', '1']`, `['1', '0', '1']`, `['0', '0', '1']`, `['1', '1', '0']`, `['0', '1', '0']`, `['1', '0', '0']`, or `['0', '0', '0']`; `flag` is 0 or 1; `length` is 30; `nalla` is incremented by 1; `i` is 6. If `x` has the 6th bit set (i.e., `x & pow(2, 6)` is true), then the third element of `s` is '1'. Otherwise, the third element of `s` is '0'.**
