Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an integer read from the input; `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each either the string `'1'` or the string `'0'`; `length` is 30; `flag` is either 0 or 1; `i` is 29. If `flag` was 1 and the 30th element of `s` was `'0'`, then the 30th element of `s` is changed to `'1'` and `flag` is set to 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to `s` or `flag`.**
