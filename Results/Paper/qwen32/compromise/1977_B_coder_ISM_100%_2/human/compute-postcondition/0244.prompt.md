Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; for each of the `t` test cases, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < 2^30.
Code of the loop:
for nalla in range(t):
    x = int(input())
    s = []
    length = 30
    for i in range(30):
        if x & pow(2, i):
            s.append('1')
        else:
            s.append('0')
    flag = 0
    for i in range(0, 29):
        if flag and s[i] == '0':
            s[i] = '1'
            flag = 0
        if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
            s[i] = '-1'
            flag = 1
        elif flag == 1:
            s[i] = '0'
        else:
            pass
    if flag and s[29] == '0':
        s[29] = '1'
    elif flag:
        s[29] = '0'
        s.append('1')
        length += 1
    for i in range(1, length):
        if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
            s[i] = '0'
            s[i - 1] = '-1'
    print(length)
    print(*s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer read from the input, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `x` is an integer read from the input; `s` is a list containing either 30 or 31 elements, with no consecutive `'1'` and `'-1'` elements; `flag` is 0 or 1 depending on the initial conditions; `length` is either 30 or 31, matching the number of elements in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The list `s` will not contain any consecutive `-1` and `1` pairs. The `length` of the list remains unchanged unless the initial condition involving `flag` and `s[29]` modifies it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The list `s` will have the `-1` moved as far left as possible, stopping at the first `'0'` or the beginning of the list. If there is no `-1`, `s` remains unchanged. The value of `length` and any other variables not modified by the loop remain the same.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
