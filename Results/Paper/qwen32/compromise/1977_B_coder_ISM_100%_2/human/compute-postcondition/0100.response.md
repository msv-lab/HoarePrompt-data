Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `x` is a new integer read from the input; `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each either `'1'` or `'0'`, representing the binary representation of `x` from the least significant bit to the 30th bit; `flag` is 0 or 1 depending on the initial conditions; `length` is 30; `nalla` is incremented by 1.**

In simple terms, after the loop completes all 30 iterations, the list `s` will contain the binary digits of the integer `x`, starting from the least significant bit up to the 30th bit. All other variables (`t`, `flag`, `length`, and `nalla`) remain unchanged except that `nalla` is incremented by 1.
