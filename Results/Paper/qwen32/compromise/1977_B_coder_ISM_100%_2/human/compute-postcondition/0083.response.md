The code snippet `x = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `x`. This means the value of `x` changes to whatever integer is provided as input. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer read from the input, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `x` is an integer read from the input
- `s` is a list containing either 30 or 31 elements, with no consecutive `'1'` and `'-1'` elements
- `flag` is 0 or 1 depending on the initial conditions
- `length` is either 30 or 31, matching the number of elements in `s`
- `nalla` is incremented by 1

After executing the code snippet, the value of `x` changes to the new integer input. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `flag`, `length`, and `nalla`) remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `x` is a new integer read from the input; `s` is a list containing either 30 or 31 elements, with no consecutive `'1'` and `'-1'` elements; `flag` is 0 or 1 depending on the initial conditions; `length` is either 30 or 31, matching the number of elements in `s`; `nalla` is incremented by 1.**
