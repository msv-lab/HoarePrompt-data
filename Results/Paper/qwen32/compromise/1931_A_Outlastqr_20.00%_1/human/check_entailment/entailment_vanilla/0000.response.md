Let's analyze the given problem and the provided Python program to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that can be formed from a given encoded integer. The encoding is based on the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve this problem by using a direct approach based on the value of `n` (the encoded integer):

1. **For `n > 52`:** The program suggests that the first letter is `alphabet[n - 53]` and the last two letters are 'zz'. This is incorrect because the sum of the positions of three letters cannot exceed 78 (26 + 26 + 26). Also, `n - 53` might not always yield a valid letter index.
   
2. **For `26 < n <= 52`:** The program suggests that the first letter is 'a', the second letter is `alphabet[n - 28]`, and the third letter is 'z'. This logic is flawed because `n - 28` might yield an invalid index for the alphabet (less than 0 or greater than 25).

3. **For `n <= 26`:** The program suggests that the first two letters are 'aa' and the third letter is `alphabet[n - 3]`. This logic is incorrect because `n - 3` might yield an invalid index for the alphabet (less than 0 or greater than 25).

### Correct Approach
To find the lexicographically smallest word, we should start with the smallest possible letters and incrementally adjust the letters to reach the target sum `n`.

### Correctness
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases and does not ensure that the generated word is lexicographically smallest. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
