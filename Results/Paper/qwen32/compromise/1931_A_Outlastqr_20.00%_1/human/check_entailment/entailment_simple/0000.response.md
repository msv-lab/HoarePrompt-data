Let's analyze the given program and determine if it correctly solves the problem based on the provided logic and test cases.

The problem requires finding the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to a given integer `n`. The logic in the program is as follows:

1. **For n > 52**: The program suggests a word starting with `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`. This means the first letter is chosen such that its position in the alphabet plus 53 equals `n`, and the remaining two letters are 'z'. This is because 'z' is the largest letter, and using it twice ensures the word is lexicographically small while achieving the required sum.

2. **For 27 <= n <= 52**: The program suggests a word starting with 'a' followed by `alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. This means the second letter is chosen such that its position in the alphabet plus 28 equals `n`, and the remaining letter is 'z'. This ensures the word is lexicographically small while achieving the required sum.

3. **For 3 <= n <= 26**: The program suggests a word starting with 'aa' followed by `alphabet[n - 3]`. This means the third letter is chosen such that its position in the alphabet plus 3 equals `n`. This ensures the word is lexicographically small while achieving the required sum.

Let's verify the logic with the provided test cases:

- **n = 24**: The program suggests 'aav'. The sum is 1 + 1 + 22 = 24. This is correct.
- **n = 70**: The program suggests 'rzz'. The sum is 18 + 26 + 26 = 70. This is correct.
- **n = 3**: The program suggests 'aaa'. The sum is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. This is correct.
- **n = 55**: The program suggests 'czz'. The sum is 3 + 26 + 26 = 55. This is correct.
- **n = 48**: The program suggests 'auz'. The sum is 1 + 21 + 26 = 48. This is correct.

All the test cases match the expected output, and the logic in the program seems to correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for the given sum.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Reasoning: The logic in the program correctly handles all possible cases for the given range of `n` and produces the lexicographically smallest word for each case. The test cases provided align with the expected output based on the program's logic.

Correctness: **True**
