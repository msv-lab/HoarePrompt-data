Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters for all possible encoded values. The logic used in the program is not sufficient to cover all cases, especially when the encoded value is not very close to the maximum possible sum of 78 (which is 'zzz' or 26 + 26 + 26).

To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible combinations of three letters and find the combination that sums up to the given encoded value and is lexicographically smallest. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        for a in range(1, 27):
            for b in range(1, 27):
                for c in range(1, 27):
                    if a + b + c == n:
                        current_word = chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96)
                        if word == '' or current_word < word:
                            word = current_word
        print(word)

func()
```

This program correctly iterates through all possible combinations of three letters, checks if their sum equals the encoded value, and keeps track of the lexicographically smallest word that matches the condition.
