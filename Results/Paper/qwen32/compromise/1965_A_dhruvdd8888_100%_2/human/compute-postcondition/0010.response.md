Let's break down the loop and see how the variables `nw` and `cw` change with each iteration. The list `nums` consists entirely of 1s, so the condition `if nums[i] == 1` will always be true. The loop iterates from the second last element of the list to the second element (since the range is `range(len(nums) - 2, 0, -1)`).

1. **Initial State**: `nums` is a list of 1s, `ls` is the sum of the original `nums`, `nw` is `True`, `cw` is `True`.
2. **First Iteration (i = len(nums) - 2)**:
   - Since `nums[i] == 1`, `cw` becomes `not nw`, which is `not True` or `False`.
   - `nw` then becomes the value of `cw`, which is `False`.
3. **Subsequent Iterations**:
   - For each subsequent iteration, `nums[i]` will still be 1, so `cw` will become `not nw`.
   - Since `nw` was set to `False` in the first iteration, `cw` will be `not False` or `True`.
   - `nw` will then be set to the value of `cw`, which is `True`.
   - This pattern continues, alternating `cw` and `nw` between `False` and `True` with each iteration.

Since the list `nums` is composed entirely of 1s, the loop will alternate `cw` and `nw` between `False` and `True` for each iteration. However, after the final iteration, `nw` will be `True` and `cw` will be `False` because the last iteration will set `cw` to `not nw` (which is `not True` or `False`), and then `nw` to the value of `cw` (which is `False`).

Output State: **`nums` is a list of 1s with the same length as the initial `nums`, `ls` is the sum of the original `nums` list, `nw` is `True`, `cw` is `False`.**
