The given code snippet only initializes a variable `ls` to 0. No other variables are modified or introduced. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain as described in the initial state; `nums` is a sorted list of integers derived from the unique strings in the initial `nums` set; `ls` is 0.**
