Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 100. The list of integers `c_1, c_2, ..., c_n` represents the numbers written on the cards and each `c_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 100.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is now assigned the value of the integer input, which is between 1 and 500, inclusive. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged as they have not been affected by this input statement.
