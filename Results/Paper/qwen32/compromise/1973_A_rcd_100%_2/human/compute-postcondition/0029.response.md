The value of `x` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `y`) remain unchanged. The conditions on `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and the relationship between `y` and `x` still hold true.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`; `y` must be at least `x`; `x` is increased by 1.**
