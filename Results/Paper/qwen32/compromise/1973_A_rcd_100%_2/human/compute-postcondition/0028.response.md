Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`; `y` must be at least `x` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, but the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
