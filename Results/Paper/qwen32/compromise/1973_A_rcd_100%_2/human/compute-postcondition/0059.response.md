Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499; `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `x` and `y` are such that `y >= x + 1`.**

The value of `x` has been incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `y` remain unchanged. The condition `y >= x` still holds, but now `y` must be at least `x + 1`.
