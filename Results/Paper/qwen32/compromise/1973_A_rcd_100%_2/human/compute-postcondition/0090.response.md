Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 â‰¤ `t` - 1 â‰¤ 499; `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` must be at least 4; `x` is increased by 1; `y` is decreased by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `y` has been decreased by 1, and the value of `x` has been increased by 1. All other conditions and values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged.
