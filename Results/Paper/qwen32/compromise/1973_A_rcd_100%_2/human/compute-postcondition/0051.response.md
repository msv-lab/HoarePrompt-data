Let's break down the problem step by step based on the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 499\).
- `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- Conditional assignment for `x` and `y`:
  - If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, then `x` remains 0 and `y` remains `p3`.
  - Otherwise, `x` is set to 1 and `y` is set to `max(1, p3 - 1)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(p1 - x + p3)
```

### Analysis:
The value printed by the `print` statement depends on the values of `p1`, `p3`, and `x`.

1. **Determine `x`**:
   - The value of `x` is determined by the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y`.
   - If the condition is true, `x` remains 0.
   - If the condition is false, `x` is set to 1.

2. **Expression to be printed**:
   - The expression to be printed is `p1 - x + p3`.
   - Since `x` can only be 0 or 1, the expression simplifies to either `p1 + p3` (if `x` is 0) or `p1 + p3 - 1` (if `x` is 1).

### Possible Scenarios:
- **Scenario 1: `x` is 0**:
  - This happens if `p1 - 0 <= p2 - y` which simplifies to `p1 <= p2 - y`.
  - Since `y` is `p3` in this scenario, the condition becomes `p1 <= p2 - p3`.
  - If this condition is true, the expression `p1 - x + p3` evaluates to `p1 + p3`.

- **Scenario 2: `x` is 1**:
  - This happens if `p1 - 0 > p2 - y` which simplifies to `p1 > p2 - y`.
  - Since `y` is `max(1, p3 - 1)` in this scenario, the condition becomes `p1 > p2 - max(1, p3 - 1)`.
  - If this condition is true, the expression `p1 - x + p3` evaluates to `p1 + p3 - 1`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement will be either `p1 + p3` or `p1 + p3 - 1`, depending on the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` and the condition that determines `x`.

Output: **p1 + p3 - x (where x is 0 if p1 <= p2 - p3, otherwise x is 1)**
