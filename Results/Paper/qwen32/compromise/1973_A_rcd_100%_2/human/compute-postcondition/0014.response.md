Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
2. `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input.
3. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
4. `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.
5. `x` is 0.
6. `y` is equal to `p3`.
7. `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(p1 - x + p3)
```

### Analysis:
- Since `x` is 0, the expression simplifies to `p1 + p3`.
- The condition that `p3` is less than `p1 + p2` and `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y` (which is `p2 - p3` since `y = p3`) does not affect the value of `p1 + p3` directly. These conditions are more about the relationship between the variables rather than the value of `p1 + p3`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the sum of `p1` and `p3`.

Output: **p1 + p3**
