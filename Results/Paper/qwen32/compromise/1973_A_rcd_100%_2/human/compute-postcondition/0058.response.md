Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499; `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `x` and `y` are such that `y >= x` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of the variables `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
