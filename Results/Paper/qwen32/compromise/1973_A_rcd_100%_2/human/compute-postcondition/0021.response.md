To determine what will be printed by the `print(p1 - x + p3)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the provided conditions:

1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500. This variable `t` does not directly influence the calculation in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for this specific task.

2. `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input. Additionally, we know:
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.
   - `p3` must be at least 2 if `x` is 1 and `y` is `p3 - 1`.

3. The variable `x` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is used in the print statement. This means we need to consider the possible values of `x` to understand the output.

Let's analyze the print statement `print(p1 - x + p3)`:

- `p1` and `p3` are integers read from the input.
- `x` is an integer that could be either 0 or 1 (since no other values are mentioned, and it's common for such variables to be binary in such contexts).

### Case Analysis for `x`:

#### Case 1: `x = 0`
- The expression becomes `p1 - 0 + p3`, which simplifies to `p1 + p3`.

#### Case 2: `x = 1`
- The expression becomes `p1 - 1 + p3`, which simplifies to `p1 + p3 - 1`.

### Additional Condition:
- `p3` must be at least 2 if `x` is 1 and `y` is `p3 - 1`. This condition does not directly affect the output of the print statement but provides a constraint on `p3` when `x = 1`.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, we can conclude that the output of the `print` statement depends on the value of `x`. Therefore, the output will be either `p1 + p3` or `p1 + p3 - 1`, depending on whether `x` is 0 or 1.

Output: **p1 + p3 - x (where x is either 0 or 1)**
