Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` - 1 ≤ 499; `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` must be at least 4. If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `x` is increased by 1 and `y` is decreased by 1.**
