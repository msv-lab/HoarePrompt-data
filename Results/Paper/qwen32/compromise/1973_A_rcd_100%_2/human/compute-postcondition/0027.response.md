To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Given Information:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500.
2. `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input.
3. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
4. `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.
5. `y` must be at least `x`.

### Code to Analyze:
```python
print(p1 - x + p3)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement outputs the result of the expression `p1 - x + p3`.
- From the initial state, we know the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, but `x` is not explicitly defined in the initial state.
- Since `x` is not provided, we cannot compute an exact numerical value for `p1 - x + p3`.
- However, we can describe the expression in terms of the known and unknown variables.

### Output Description:
The output will be the result of the expression `p1 - x + p3`, where `p1` and `p3` are known integers (from the input), and `x` is an unknown integer.

### Final Output:
Output: **p1 - x + p3 (where p1 and p3 are integers from the input, and x is an unknown integer)**
