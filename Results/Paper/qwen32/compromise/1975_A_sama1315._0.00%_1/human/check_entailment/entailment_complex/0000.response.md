### Reasoning:

The task is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where the array is split into two parts and the parts are swapped. The key insight here is that the array can be split into two parts at any point, and the parts can be swapped. This operation is equivalent to rotating the array, and the problem essentially boils down to checking if the array can be rotated to become sorted.

The provided program consists of two functions:

1. **`func_1(arr)`**: This function checks if the array `arr` is already in non-decreasing order. If it is, it returns 'Yes'. If not, it seems to have a redundant check (since the `all` condition already ensures the array is sorted, the `any` condition is unnecessary). However, the logic is correct in that it returns 'No' if the array is not sorted.

2. **`func_2()`**: This function reads multiple test cases from the input, processes each test case by calling `func_1` on the array, and then prints the results.

The problem description, however, requires checking if the array can be rotated to become sorted, not just if it is already sorted. The provided `func_1` does not implement this logic. It only checks if the array is already sorted. To correctly solve the problem, `func_1` should check if the array can be rotated to become sorted.

Hereâ€™s an example where the current implementation fails:

- Consider the array `[3, 1, 2]`. This array is not sorted, so `func_1` will return 'No'. However, it can be rotated to become `[1, 2, 3]`, which is sorted. The correct implementation should return 'Yes' for this array.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is **incorrect** because it does not correctly determine if the array can be rotated to become sorted. The current implementation only checks if the array is already sorted.

**Correctness: False**
