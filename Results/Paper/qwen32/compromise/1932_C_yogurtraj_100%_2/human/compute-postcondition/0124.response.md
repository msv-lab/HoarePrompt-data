Postcondition: **The first element of `y` is now either `k * a[q2] % m` if `t[i] == 'R'`, or `k * a[q1] % m` otherwise, and the last element of `y` remains the same as the first element. The element at index `n-3` of `y` is `k`. `i` is `n-4`, and `n` remains the same. If `t[i] == 'R'`, then `q2` is incremented by 1. If `t[i] != 'R'`, then `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m` and `q1` is decreased by 1.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block has executed, considering both the if and else parts.
