The value of `q2` is updated to `l + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input string, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer from input, `m` is an integer from input, `a` is a list of integers from the input line, `l` is the count of 'L' in `t`, `k` is `a[l] % m`, `q1` is `l - 1`, and `q2` is `l + 1`. The last character of `t` is not 'L'.
