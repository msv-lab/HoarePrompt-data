To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the state of the variables as described in the initial state and how they are related to the `print(*y)` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is the new input string.
- `ii` is set to 1.
- `n` is the first integer from the new input.
- `m` is the second integer from the new input.
- `a` is a list of integers from the new input line.
- `l` is the count of 'L' in the new `t`.
- `y` is a list of `n` elements where each element `y[i]` is the value of `k` after the corresponding iteration.
- `i` is 0.
- `k` is the final value after the last iteration.
- `q1` and `q2` are adjusted based on the number of 'R' and non-'R' characters encountered.

### The `print(*y)` Statement:
The `print(*y)` statement will print all the elements of the list `y` separated by spaces.

### Analysis of `y`:
- `y` is a list of `n` elements.
- Each element `y[i]` is the value of `k` after the corresponding iteration.

Since the exact values of `n`, `k` after each iteration, and the list `y` are not explicitly provided, we can describe the output based on the structure of the problem.

### Output Description:
The `print(*y)` statement will print the values of `k` after each of the `n` iterations, separated by spaces.

Output: **y[0] y[1] ... y[n-1] (where each y[i] is the value of k after the i-th iteration)**
