Postcondition: **`t` is the new input string, `ii` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a new list of integers from the latest input line, `l` is the count of 'L' in the new `t`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element updated to `k`, `i` is 0. If the first character of `t` is 'R', then `k` is `(a[l - 1] % m) * a[l] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `k` is `(a[l] % m) * a[l + 1] % m`. `q1` is `l - 2` and `q2` is `l + 1` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q1` is `l - 1` and `q2` is `l + 2`. If the first character of `t` is not 'R', then `k` is `k * a[q1] % m`. If the last character of `t` is 'L', then `k` is `a[l - 1] % m`, `q1` is `l - 3`, and `q2` is `l`. Otherwise, `k` is `a[l] % m`, `q1` is `l - 2`, and `q2` is `l + 1`.**
