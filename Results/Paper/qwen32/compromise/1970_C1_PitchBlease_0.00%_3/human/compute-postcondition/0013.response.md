Output State: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree where `tree[start]` must have at least one neighbor, `queue` is a deque, `visited` is a set containing `start` and `neighbor` and possibly other elements, `current` is equal to `start` or another node, `dist` is a non-negative integer, and `current` is not equal to `target`. `neighbor` is the next neighbor in `tree[current]` that has not yet been processed in this iteration.**

In simple terms, the `visited` set now includes the `neighbor` node, which was not in the set before. All other variables remain unchanged.
