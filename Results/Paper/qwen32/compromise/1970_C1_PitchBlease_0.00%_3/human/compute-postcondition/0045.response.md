Output State: **`queue` is not empty, `visited` contains all reachable nodes from `start` including `neighbor`, `current` is the first element of the tuple removed from the queue and is a key in `tree` with `tree[current]` having at least one element, `dist` is the second element of the tuple removed from the queue, and `neighbor` is not in `visited` (but now it is added to `visited`).**

In simpler terms, the `neighbor` has been added to the `visited` set, so it is now part of the set of all reachable nodes from `start`. All other variables retain their previous states.
