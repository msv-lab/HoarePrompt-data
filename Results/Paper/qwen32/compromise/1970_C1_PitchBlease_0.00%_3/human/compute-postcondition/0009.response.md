The code `visited.add(neighbor)` adds the `neighbor` to the `visited` set. This means that `neighbor` is now part of the set `visited`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree where `tree[start]` must have at least one neighbor, `queue` is a deque (now empty), `visited` is a set containing the single element `start` and possibly other elements including `neighbor`, `current` is equal to `start` or another node, `dist` is a non-negative integer, `current` is not equal to `target`, and `neighbor` is not in `visited` (previously true, now false).**
