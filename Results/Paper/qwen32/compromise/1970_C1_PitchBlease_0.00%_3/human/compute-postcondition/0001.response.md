Output State: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree where each key is a node and its value is a list of its neighbors, `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`, `visited` is a set containing the single element `start`.**

In simple terms, the output state is that `visited` now contains the starting node `start`, and all other variables remain unchanged.
