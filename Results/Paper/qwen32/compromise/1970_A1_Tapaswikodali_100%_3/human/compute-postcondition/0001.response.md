The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `balance_info`. This does not affect the values of `s` or `n`. The string `s` remains a string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000. The length of `s` remains `n`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` is an empty list.**
