The code snippet initializes a variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `x`, or `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `x` is the first integer from the input such that 1 <= x <= 10^8; `n` is the second integer from the input such that 1 <= n <= x; `ans` is 0.**
