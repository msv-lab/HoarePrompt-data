To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, we need to understand the value of `ans` based on the given initial state.

The variable `ans` is defined as the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or whose corresponding pair divisor (i.e., `x // i`) is less than or equal to `n`.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Identify Divisors of `x`:**
   - A divisor of `x` is any integer `i` such that `x % i == 0`.
   - For each divisor `i`, there is a corresponding pair divisor `x // i`.

2. **Condition for `ans`:**
   - `ans` should be the largest value of `i` such that `i <= n` or `x // i <= n`.

3. **Finding `ans`:**
   - We need to iterate through the divisors of `x` and check the conditions.
   - For each divisor `i`:
     - If `i <= n`, then `i` is a candidate for `ans`.
     - If `x // i <= n`, then `x // i` is also a candidate for `ans`.
   - Among all candidates, `ans` is the largest one.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3 (though `t` is not directly used in the calculation of `ans`).
- `x` is the first integer from the input such that 1 <= x <= 10^8.
- `n` is the second integer from the input such that 1 <= n <= x.

The output of `print(ans)` will be the largest divisor of `x` that meets the specified condition.

Output: **ans (where ans is the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to n or whose corresponding pair divisor (x // i) is less than or equal to n)**
