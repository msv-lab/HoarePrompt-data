Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to solve the problem of constructing the maximum number of regular (equal-sided) polygons from given sticks. However, there is a discrepancy between the problem's requirements and the implementation in the `func_1` function.

The problem requires constructing polygons with equal-sided lengths, meaning the number of sticks of a particular length must be divisible by the number of sides of a polygon (which can be 3 for a triangle, 4 for a square, 5 for a pentagon, etc.). The function `func_1` only considers forming triangles (dividing the count of each stick length by 3). This is not sufficient for solving the general problem, as it does not account for the possibility of forming polygons with more than 3 sides.

For example, in the fourth test case, the function will return 0 because it only considers sets of three sticks of the same length, whereas the correct answer is 2, as a pentagon with side length 2 and a square with side length 4 can be formed.

Therefore, the program is not correct for the given problem description.

Correctness: **False**
