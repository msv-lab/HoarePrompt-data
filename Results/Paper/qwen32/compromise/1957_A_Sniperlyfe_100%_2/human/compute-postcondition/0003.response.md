Output State: **The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the dictionary `freq` by 3.**

This means that for each unique integer in the list `arr`, the program calculates how many times that integer appears in `arr` (which is the value in `freq`), divides that count by 3 (integer division), and sums all these results.
