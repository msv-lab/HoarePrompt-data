To determine the output of the `print(p1 + p2)` statement, we need to carefully consider the initial state and the given conditions.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). This variable `t` is not directly involved in the `print(p1 + p2)` statement, so we can ignore it for this specific print statement.
2. `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers.
3. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
4. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the program continues without further action. However, this condition does not affect the `print(p1 + p2)` statement directly.
5. The loop condition and the subsequent print statements are irrelevant to the `print(p1 + p2)` statement.

### Analysis:
The `print(p1 + p2)` statement directly prints the sum of `p1` and `p2`. Since the exact values of `p1` and `p2` are not provided, we cannot compute a numerical value for `p1 + p2`. However, we know that the sum of `p1` and `p2` is part of the condition that the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. This means that `p1 + p2` must be even (since the sum of an even number and an odd number is odd).

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state, the `print(p1 + p2)` statement will output the sum of `p1` and `p2`, which is an even integer based on the condition that the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 + p2 is an even integer as the sum of p1, p2, and p3 is odd)**
