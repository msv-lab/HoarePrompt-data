Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 499; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `cur` is equal to `low + 1`; `p1 - cur` is greater than `p2 - (p3 - cur)`**

The value of `cur` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
