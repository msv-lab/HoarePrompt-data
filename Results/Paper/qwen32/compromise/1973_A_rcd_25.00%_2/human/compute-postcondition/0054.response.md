Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` and must be greater than `low + 1`; `cur` is less than `high` and has been incremented by 1.**

In simple terms: The value of `cur` has increased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
