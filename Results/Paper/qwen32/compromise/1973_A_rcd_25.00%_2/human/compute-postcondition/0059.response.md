The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer within a certain range, and `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers with the sum being odd. The initial state also includes a condition that if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the program continues without further action. Otherwise, it checks another condition involving `cur`, `low`, and `high` which are not defined in the current snippet.

Since the snippet provided only reads the input values and assigns them to `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, the output state will reflect these changes. The variables `t`, `low`, `high`, and any other conditions remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 499; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.**
