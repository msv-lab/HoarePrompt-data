Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `cur` is equal to `low`; `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`**

In simpler terms, the postcondition states that `t` is still an integer within the range of 1 to 500, and `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` retain their values with the sum being odd. The variables `low` and `high` are calculated as the minimum and maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, respectively, and `cur` is set to `low`. Additionally, the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` holds true.
