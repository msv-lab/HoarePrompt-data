To determine what will be printed by the `print(p1 - cur + p3)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the calculation involved.

1. **Variables and Conditions**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500 (though `t` does not directly influence the print statement).
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` and must be greater than `low + 1`.
   - `cur` is less than `high`.

2. **Expression to Evaluate**:
   - The expression to be printed is `p1 - cur + p3`.

3. **Analysis**:
   - We need to calculate the value of `p1 - cur + p3`.
   - The values of `p1`, `p3`, and `cur` are not explicitly provided, but we know that `cur` is less than `high`, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.

4. **Output**:
   - The output will be the result of the expression `p1 - cur + p3`. Since the exact values of `p1`, `p3`, and `cur` are not given, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **p1 - cur + p3 (where p1, p3, and cur are integers such that cur is less than the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2)**
