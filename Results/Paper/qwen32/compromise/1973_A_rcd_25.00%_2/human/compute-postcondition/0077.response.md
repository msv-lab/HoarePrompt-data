Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 499; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` must be at least `cur`. If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, `cur` remains equal to `low`. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 1.**
