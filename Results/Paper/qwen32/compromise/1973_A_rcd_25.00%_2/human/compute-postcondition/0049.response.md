The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. Given the initial state, `cur` was either `low` or `low + 1`. After the increment, `cur` will be `low + 1` or `low + 2`, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` and must be greater than `low + 1`; If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, `cur` was `low`. Otherwise, `cur` was `low + 1`. Now, `cur` is either `low + 1` or `low + 2`.**
