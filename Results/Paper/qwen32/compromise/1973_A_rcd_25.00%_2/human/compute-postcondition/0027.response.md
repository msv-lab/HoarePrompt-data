Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input; The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` must be at least `cur`; `cur` is increased by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `cur` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and constraints as described.
