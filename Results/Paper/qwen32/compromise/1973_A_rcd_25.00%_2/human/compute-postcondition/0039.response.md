To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the variables `high` and `cur` as they are the only ones involved in the loop condition `high >= cur`.

Given:
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `cur` is equal to `low`, where `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.

The loop condition `high >= cur` will be satisfied if `high` is greater than or equal to `low`. Since `high` is defined as the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is defined as the minimum of the same two values, it logically follows that `high` will always be greater than or equal to `cur`.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute the first time, as the condition `high >= cur` is inherently satisfied by the definitions of `high` and `cur`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `cur` is equal to `low`**
