The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, in the provided code snippet, there is no loop structure, so the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the program flow. Therefore, none of the variables `t`, `p1`, `p2`, or `p3` are modified.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 499; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.**
