Step-by-step analysis:

The initial state provides the following information:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 499. However, `t` is not used in the provided print statement.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.

The print statement is:
```python
print(p1 + p2)
```

From the given information, we know that the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. This implies that the sum of any two of these numbers (`p1 + p2`, `p2 + p3`, `p3 + p1`) could either be odd or even. However, since `p1 + p2 + p3` is odd, and the sum of two integers is odd if and only if one is odd and the other is even, we can deduce the parity (odd or even nature) of `p1 + p2` based on the parity of `p3`.

If `p3` is odd, then `p1 + p2` must be even to make their sum (`p1 + p2 + p3`) odd.
If `p3` is even, then `p1 + p2` must be odd to make their sum (`p1 + p2 + p3`) odd.

However, the exact values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not provided, so we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `p1 + p2`. We can only determine its parity based on the given condition.

Since the exact values of `p1` and `p2` are not provided, we cannot specify the exact numerical output. However, we can describe the output based on the given condition.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 + p2 is an integer such that the sum of p1, p2, and p3 is odd)**
