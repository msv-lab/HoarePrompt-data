Reasoning:  
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to validate whether the logic within the function correctly computes the maximum number of draws based on the given scores or returns `-1` when the scores are inconsistent with any valid set of games and results.

1. **Sum Check**: The program first checks if the sum of the scores (p1, p2, p3) is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because it's impossible to have an odd total score since each game awards a total of 2 points (either 2 to the winner and 0 to the loser or 1 to each in case of a draw).

2. **Direct Draw Calculation**: If the sum is even, the program checks if `p3` (the highest score) is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`. If true, it prints `p1 + p2`. This is because, in the best-case scenario where the highest scorer (p3) has drawn with both other players, the maximum number of draws would be `p1 + p2` (since p1 and p2 could have only drawn among themselves and with p3).

3. **Iterative Draw Calculation**: If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, the program enters a loop to find the maximum number of draws. It calculates `low` and `high` as the minimum and maximum possible values of `cur` (a variable representing the number of games where `p3` has played against `p1` and `p2` respectively). The program then iterates through possible values of `cur` within this range to find the maximum number of draws that satisfy the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`. If such a `cur` is found, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` as the maximum number of draws. If no such `cur` is found, it defaults to printing `p3`.

The logic seems to cover all the scenarios correctly and efficiently given the constraints. The provided examples in the problem statement are also handled correctly by the program.

Correctness: **True**
