You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            (low, high) = (min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2))
            cur = low
            while high >= cur:
                if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                    print(p1 - cur + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    cur += 1
            else:
                print(p3)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integer scores in non-decreasing order. For each test case, it determines and prints a specific value based on the scores. If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints `-1`. If the sum is even and the highest score is at least the sum of the other two scores, it prints the sum of the two lower scores. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the largest possible value that satisfies a certain condition involving the scores, or the highest score if no such value exists.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided code does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to correctly determine the maximum number of draws for certain score combinations. Let's analyze why this is the case by looking at a few test cases.

Consider the following test case:

#### Test Case:
```
1
0 2 4
```

#### Expected Output:
```
2
```

#### Explanation of Expected Output:
- The scores are 0, 2, and 4. One possible scenario is:
  - Player 3 wins against Player 2 (2 points for Player 3, 0 points for Player 2).
  - Player 3 wins against Player 1 (2 points for Player 3, 0 points for Player 1).
  - Player 2 and Player 1 draw (1 point each).
- This results in 2 draws and the scores 0, 2, 4.

#### Actual Output from the Code:
```
4
```

#### Why the Code Fails:
The code incorrectly calculates the maximum number of draws. It uses the logic `(low, high) = (min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2))` and then iterates to find a valid configuration. For the test case `0 2 4`, the code will incorrectly compute the maximum number of draws as 4, which is not possible given the constraints.

Another problematic test case is:

#### Test Case:
```
1
1 1 2
```

#### Expected Output:
```
2
```

#### Explanation of Expected Output:
- The scores are 1, 1, and 2. One possible scenario is:
  - Player 3 wins against Player 2 (2 points for Player 3, 0 points for Player 2).
  - Player 3 wins against Player 1 (2 points for Player 3, 0 points for Player 1).
  - Player 2 and Player 1 draw (1 point each).
- This results in 2 draws and the scores 1, 1, 2.

#### Actual Output from the Code:
```
2
```

#### Why the Code Works for This Case:
For this specific case, the code happens to give the correct answer. However, this does not mean the code is correct in all cases, as demonstrated by the first test case.

To ensure correctness, the code needs to be thoroughly reviewed and possibly rewritten to handle all edge cases and ensure it computes the maximum number of draws accurately for any valid input.

### Conclusion:
The code fails for at least one test case, making it incorrect. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
