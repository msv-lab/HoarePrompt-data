Reasoning: 
The problem requires us to maximize the score by always choosing the smallest number possible in each pair we pick from the list of integers. To achieve this, sorting the list in ascending order and then summing up the numbers at even indices (which will be the smaller numbers in each pair) is an optimal strategy.

Let's break down the provided program:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
3. It converts the list of integers from strings to integers and sorts them.
4. It then sums up the integers at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) of the sorted list, which correspond to the smaller numbers in each pair.
5. Finally, it prints the score for each test case.

This approach aligns perfectly with the optimal strategy described above. The execution summary confirms that the program follows this process correctly.

Correctness: **True**
