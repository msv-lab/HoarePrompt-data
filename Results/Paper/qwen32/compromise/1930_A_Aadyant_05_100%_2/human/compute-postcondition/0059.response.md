The code appends the integer value of `str` to the list `list2`. Given that `str` is the second element of `list1`, and `list1` is a list of substrings derived from `b`, the integer value of `str` will be appended to `list2`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50, `a` is a string input by the user, `final` is a list containing the value of `s` and the value of `s` appended, `s` is 0, `b` is a string input by the user that contains at least one character, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of `n` and the integer value of the second element of `list1`, `num` is `num + 1`, `list1` is a list of substrings derived from `b` that contains at least two elements, `str` is the second element of `list1`**

In simpler terms, `list2` now includes the integer value of the second element of `list1` in addition to the integer value of `n`. All other variables retain their initial values.
