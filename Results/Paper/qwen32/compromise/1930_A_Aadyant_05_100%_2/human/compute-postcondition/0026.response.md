The only variables in the loop head are `num` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust only these two variables for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for num in range(int(n)):
    # the loop body is omit
```
At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is an integer such that `0 ≤ num < int(n)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be incremented by 1, and `n` remains the same.

Let's determine the new state:
- `num` was the value at the end of the previous iteration. Since the loop increments `num` by 1 in each iteration, we need to increase `num` by 1.
- `n` remains unchanged because it is the upper limit of the range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50; `a` is a string input by the user; `final` is a list containing the value of `s`; `s` is the sum of the integers at even indices in `list2`; `b` is a non-empty string input by the user; `list2` is a sorted list of integer values of all substrings from `b` split by whitespace; `num` is incremented by 1**.

Since we do not know the exact value of `num` at the end of the previous iteration, we can represent it as `num + 1`:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50; `a` is a string input by the user; `final` is a list containing the value of `s`; `s` is the sum of the integers at even indices in `list2`; `b` is a non-empty string input by the user; `list2` is a sorted list of integer values of all substrings from `b` split by whitespace; `num` is `num + 1`**.

To make it clear, if `num` was 2 at the end of the last iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `num` should be 3. Therefore, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50; `a` is a string input by the user; `final` is a list containing the value of `s`; `s` is the sum of the integers at even indices in `list2`; `b` is a non-empty string input by the user; `list2` is a sorted list of integer values of all substrings from `b` split by whitespace; `num` is the value of `num` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**.

Since we need to adjust only the variables in the loop head, the final state is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50; `a` is a string input by the user; `final` is a list containing the value of `s`; `s` is the sum of the integers at even indices in `list2`; `b` is a non-empty string input by the user; `list2` is a sorted list of integer values of all substrings from `b` split by whitespace; `num` is 4** (assuming `num` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration).

However, in a generalized form without specific values:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50; `a` is a string input by the user; `final` is a list containing the value of `s`; `s` is the sum of the integers at even indices in `list2`; `b` is a non-empty string input by the user; `list2` is a sorted list of integer values of all substrings from `b` split by whitespace; `num` is `num + 1`**.
