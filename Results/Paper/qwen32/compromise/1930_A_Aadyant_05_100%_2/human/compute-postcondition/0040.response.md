The code sorts the list `list2`, which contains the integer values of all substrings from `b` split by whitespace. The sorting operation does not affect any other variables except `list2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `final`, `s`, `b`, `list1`, and `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50; `a` is a string input by the user; `final` is a list containing the value of `s`; `s` is 0; `b` is a non-empty string input by the user; `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer values of all substrings from `b` split by whitespace; `num` is `num + 1`; `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` split by whitespace.**
