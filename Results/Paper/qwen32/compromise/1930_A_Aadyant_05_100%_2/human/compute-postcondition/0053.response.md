The given code snippet sets `list1` to an empty list. This affects only the variable `list1`, while all other variables remain unchanged. Here is the updated state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50; `a` is a string input by the user; `final` is a list containing the value of `s` and the value of `s` appended; `s` is 0; `b` is a non-empty string input by the user; `list2` is an empty list; `num` is `num + 1`; `list1` is an empty list**.
