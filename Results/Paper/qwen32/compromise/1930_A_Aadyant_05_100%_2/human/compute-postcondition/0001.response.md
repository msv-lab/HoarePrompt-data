Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50; `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7; `final` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the variable `final` has been initialized as an empty list, while the values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from the initial state.
