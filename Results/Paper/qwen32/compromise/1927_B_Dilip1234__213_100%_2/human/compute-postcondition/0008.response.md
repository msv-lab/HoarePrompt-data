Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is a list of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n); `s` is a string. If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, then `s` contains the character corresponding to `chr(j + ord('a'))` and `char_count[j]` is `a[i] + 1`. Otherwise, `s` remains an empty string and `char_count` remains a list of 26 zeros. `j` is 0.**
