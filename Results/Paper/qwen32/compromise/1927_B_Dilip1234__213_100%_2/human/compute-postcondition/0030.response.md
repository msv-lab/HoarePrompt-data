Output State: **`s` is a string containing characters 'a' to 'z' in the order they were matched with `a[i]` and now includes 'b' at the end; `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, `char_count[0]` is incremented by 1, `char_count[1]` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must still be greater than `i`, and `j` is 1, with the most internal loop or if statement being exited.**

Explanation: The `break` statement exits the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not change the values of the variables `s`, `char_count`, `i`, `n`, or `j`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the fact that the loop or if statement has been exited.
