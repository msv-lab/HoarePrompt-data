The code snippet `s += chr(j + ord('a'))` appends a character to the string `s`. The character is determined by converting the ASCII value of 'a' (which is 97) plus the value of `j` to a character. Given that `j` is 0, the character appended to `s` is 'a'.

The other variables (`char_count`, `i`, `n`) remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`s` is a string containing characters 'a' to 'z' in the order they were matched with `a[i]` and now also includes 'a' at the end; `char_count` has incremented values for the matched characters; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` must be greater than `i`; `j` is 0.**
