The given code snippet only imports a function (`readline`) from the `sys.stdin` module, which is used for reading input from standard input. This operation does not affect the values of any existing variables (`t`, `n`, `a`). It merely prepares the program to read input more efficiently.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, and each integer from 1 through `n` appears in the list `a` at most 2 times. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The `input` variable is now a reference to `sys.stdin.readline`.**
