Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, and each integer from 1 through `n` appears in the list `a` at most 2 times. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The `input` variable is now a reference to `sys.stdin.readline`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = [0] * (n + 1)
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] += 1
    ans = 0
    for x in cnt:
        ans += max(0, x - 1)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: 

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `iterations_left` is 0; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `x` is the count of how many times `x` appears in `a`; `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: iterations_left is 1, n is the new input integer, a is the new list of integers read from the input, cnt is a list of n + 1 elements where each element at index i represents the frequency of integer i in a, ans is the sum of (x - 1) for all x in cnt where x > 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
