Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
- There are `2n` cards, with each integer from `1` to `n` appearing exactly twice.
- Cards are distributed between two players such that each player gets `n` cards.
- Players take turns placing cards on the table.
- A player earns a point if they place a card that already exists on the table.
- Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

### Objective:
Determine the maximum number of points you can achieve if you play optimally.

### Key Observations:
- Since each number appears exactly twice, every number will eventually be placed on the table twice.
- For each number that appears twice in your hand, you can earn a point if you place the second card after the first one has been placed on the table by either player.
- The strategy revolves around how many pairs of numbers you have in your hand because each pair can potentially give you a point.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution calculates the number of pairs of cards in your hand and sums them up to determine the maximum number of points you can achieve.

Here's the breakdown of the solution:
1. **Counting Occurrences**: The code uses a list `cnt` to count the occurrences of each number in your hand.
2. **Calculating Points**: For each number `x` in your hand, if it appears more than once (`cnt[x] > 1`), you can earn a point for each additional occurrence beyond the first one (`max(0, cnt[x] - 1)`).
3. **Summing Points**: The total points you can earn is the sum of these values for all numbers.

### Correctness Verification:
- The logic correctly identifies that for each number appearing twice in your hand, you can earn one point.
- The solution assumes that Nene plays optimally, but since the question asks for the maximum points you can achieve regardless of Nene's strategy, the focus is on maximizing your own points based on the distribution of cards in your hand.
- The provided solution efficiently counts the pairs and calculates the points, which aligns with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can achieve based on the given constraints and the problem statement.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
