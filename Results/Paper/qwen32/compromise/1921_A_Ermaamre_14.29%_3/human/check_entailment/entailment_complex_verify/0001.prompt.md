You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

    #State: The output state consists of `a` lines, each line containing the area of a square calculated from the input coordinates for each of the `a` test cases. The variables `t` and `a` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. It then calculates and prints the area of the square for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The given Python program aims to calculate the area of a square based on the coordinates of its corners. The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of four lines with two integers representing the coordinates of the square's corners. The area of the square is determined by the difference in either the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of the corners, as the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes.

The program correctly identifies that two pairs of x-coordinates will be the same (since opposite sides of a square are equal and parallel to the axes). It then calculates the side length of the square by finding the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of one pair of corners or the x-coordinates of the other pair. Finally, it prints the square of this difference, which is the area of the square.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program. The program only checks three possible configurations of the corners (based on which x-coordinates are equal), but it does not handle all possible permutations of the corners. Specifically, it does not account for the scenario where x1 == x3 and x2 == x4, but the correct side length is determined by the y-coordinates of (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) or (x1, y1) and (x4, y4). Similarly, it does not handle the scenario where x1 == x2 and x3 == x4, but the correct side length is determined by the y-coordinates of (x1, y1) and (x3, y3) or (x2, y2) and (x4, y4). The same issue applies to the scenario where x1 == x4 and x3 == x2.

To fix this, the program should calculate the side length by finding the maximum difference between the x-coordinates and the maximum difference between the y-coordinates, and then use the larger of these two differences as the side length of the square.
