To understand the output state, let's break down what the provided code does. The code iterates `a` times, where `a` is the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The code then calculates the side length of the square and prints the area of the square.

The logic for finding the side length checks the x-coordinates of the corners to determine which pair of y-coordinates to use for calculating the side length of the square. Once the side length is found, it squares this value to get the area of the square and prints it.

Since the loop iterates `a` times and prints the area of the square for each test case, the output state will be the sequence of printed areas for each of the `a` test cases. The variables `t` and `a` remain unchanged, and the coordinates of the corners are read from the input for each iteration.

Output State: **The output state consists of `a` lines, each line containing the area of a square calculated from the input coordinates for each of the `a` test cases. The variables `t` and `a` remain unchanged.**
