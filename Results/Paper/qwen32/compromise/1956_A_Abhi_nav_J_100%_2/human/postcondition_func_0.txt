The function `func_1` takes two lists as input: `a`, which contains `k` distinct integers in strictly increasing order between 1 and 100 inclusive, and `b`, which contains `q` integers between 1 and 100 inclusive. It returns a new list where each element is one less than the corresponding element in `a` if `a` is considered less than or equal to `b`. Otherwise, it returns the list `b`.
