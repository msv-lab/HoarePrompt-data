Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` is incorrectly defined. It does not simulate the process of kicking out players based on the sequence `a`. Instead, it simply returns `a-1` if `a` is less than or equal to `b`, otherwise it returns `b`. This does not match the rules of the game.

2. The main loop iterates over the test cases and reads the necessary inputs, but it incorrectly calls `func_1` with only the first element of the sequence `a` and each value of `n_i`. It should instead process the entire sequence `a` to determine which players are kicked out in each round.

3. The logic for simulating the rounds of the game and keeping track of which players remain is completely missing.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def simulate_game(a, n):
    players = list(range(1, n + 1))
    while True:
        kicked_out = set()
        for position in a:
            if position - 1 < len(players):
                kicked_out.add(players[position - 1])
        if not kicked_out:
            break
        players = [player for player in players if player not in kicked_out]
    return len(players)

n = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(n):
    k, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n_values = list(map(int, input().split()))
    results.append([simulate_game(a, n_i) for n_i in n_values])

for result in results:
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
```

This corrected program properly simulates the game for each value of `n_i` using the sequence `a` to determine which players are kicked out in each round until no more players can be kicked out. It then counts the remaining players as the winners.
