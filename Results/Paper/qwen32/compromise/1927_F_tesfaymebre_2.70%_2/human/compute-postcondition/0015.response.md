To determine what will be printed by the `print(*res)` statement, we need to understand the context and the values of the variables involved. Here's a step-by-step breakdown based on the given initial state:

1. **Variables and Objects**:
   - `n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
   - `graph` is a data structure representing the graph (unchanged).
   - `edges` is a list of edges (unchanged).
   - `dsu` reflects the connected components of the graph.
   - `_min_edge` is the smallest edge weight in any connected component.
   - `node_u` and `node_v` are the nodes of the edge with the smallest weight in the connected component.
   - `colors` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, used for marking nodes during traversal.
   - `res` holds the result of `dfs(node_u, -1, [])`, which is the result of a depth-first search starting from `node_u`.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - The DFS function is called with `node_u` as the starting node, `-1` as the parent node (indicating no parent), and an empty list `[]` to store the result.
   - The DFS will traverse the graph starting from `node_u`, visiting all nodes in the connected component that includes `node_u`.
   - The result of the DFS, stored in `res`, will be a list of nodes visited in the order they were encountered during the traversal.

3. **Output**:
   - The `print(*res)` statement will print the elements of the `res` list, which contains the nodes visited during the DFS starting from `node_u`.

Given the information provided, we can't determine the exact numerical values of the nodes in `res` because the specific graph structure and the starting node `node_u` are not provided. However, we can describe the output in terms of the DFS traversal.

Output: **res (where res is the list of nodes visited during the DFS traversal starting from node_u)**
