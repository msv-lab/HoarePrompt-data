### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the code, and the function summary provided.

1. **Input Parsing and Graph Representation:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m`.
   - It then reads each edge, storing the vertices and the weight in an adjacency list (`graph`) and a list of edges (`edges`).
   - This part is correctly implemented.

2. **Edge Sorting:**
   - The edges are sorted in descending order based on their weights. This is correctly implemented.

3. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU):**
   - The DSU data structure is used to detect cycles in the graph. The DSU keeps track of the minimum edge weight in each connected component.
   - The DSU is implemented but the union method does not correctly update the minimum edge weight in the set when a new edge is added. This is an issue.

4. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted edges, using the DSU to detect cycles. When a cycle is detected (i.e., two vertices are already in the same set), it checks if the minimum edge weight in the cycle is smaller than the current smallest.
   - This part is conceptually correct but the DSU implementation has issues.

5. **Cycle Reconstruction:**
   - Once the cycle with the smallest minimum edge weight is found, the program reconstructs the cycle using a Depth-First Search (DFS).
   - The DFS function `dfs` uses global variables `graph`, `node_u`, and `node_v`, which is incorrect. These variables should be passed as arguments.
   - The DFS function modifies the `path` list in place and returns it. However, the `path` list is not reset between test cases, which could lead to incorrect results.
   - The DFS function checks if `node_v` is in the set of visited nodes to determine if a cycle has been found. This is not the correct approach for reconstructing a cycle correctly. The correct approach involves keeping track of the path from the start node to the current node and identifying the cycle when a back edge is encountered.

6. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the minimum weight of the edge in the cycle and the vertices in the cycle.
   - Due to the issues mentioned in cycle reconstruction and DSU implementation, the output is not guaranteed to be correct.

### Issues Identified:
- **DFS Function:** The DFS function `dfs` uses global variables `graph`, `node_u`, and `node_v`, which should be passed as arguments.
- **DFS Function:** The `path` list is not reset between test cases, which could lead to incorrect results.
- **Cycle Reconstruction:** The DFS function checks if `node_v` is in the set of visited nodes to determine if a cycle has been found. This is not the correct approach for reconstructing a cycle correctly.
- **Edge Weight Update:** The DSU's `union` method should update the minimum edge weight in the set when a new edge is added. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: False**
