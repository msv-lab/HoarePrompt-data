### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to carefully analyze the logic used to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. The program uses a dictionary (`freq`) to keep track of the frequency of pairs of modular residues `(mod_x, mod_y)` for each element in the array. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: For each test case, initialize a dictionary `freq` to store the frequency of pairs of modular residues `(mod_x, mod_y)` and a counter `beautiful_count` to count the number of beautiful pairs.

2. **Iterate through the array**: For each number `num` in the array `a`:
   - Calculate `mod_x = num % x` and `mod_y = num % y`.
   - Determine `required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x`. This is because for `a_i + a_j` to be divisible by `x`, `(a_i % x) + (a_j % x)` should be divisible by `x`. If `a_i % x = mod_x`, then `a_j % x` should be `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y = mod_y` because for `a_i - a_j` to be divisible by `y`, `(a_i % y) - (a_j % y)` should be divisible by `y`. If `a_i % y = mod_y`, then `a_j % y` should also be `mod_y`.

3. **Check for beautiful pairs**: If the pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in the dictionary `freq`, it means there are elements in the array that can form beautiful pairs with the current element `num`. Add the frequency of this pair to `beautiful_count`.

4. **Update frequency dictionary**: Update the frequency of the current pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the dictionary `freq`.

5. **Return results**: After processing all test cases, return the list of beautiful pair counts.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- The program correctly identifies the conditions for a pair to be beautiful.
- It efficiently keeps track of the necessary modular residues using a dictionary, which allows it to count beautiful pairs in linear time relative to the size of the array.
- The logic for calculating `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` is correct based on the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. It accurately counts the number of beautiful pairs for each test case and handles the constraints appropriately.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
