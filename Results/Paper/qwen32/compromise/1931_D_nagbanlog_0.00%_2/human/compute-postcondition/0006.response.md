To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`t`**: An integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
2. **`test_cases`**: A list containing at least one test case. Each test case is a tuple `(n, x, y, a)` where:
   - `n`: An integer representing the length of the array `a`, with the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
   - `x`: An integer with the constraint 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.
   - `y`: An integer with the constraint 1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9.
   - `a`: A list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
3. **`results`**: An empty list that will likely store the results of processing each test case.
4. **`n`**: Extracted from `case['params']`, which is the first element of the tuple representing the current test case.
5. **`x`**: Extracted from `case['params']`, which is the second element of the tuple representing the current test case.
6. **`y`**: Extracted from `case['params']`, which is the third element of the tuple representing the current test case.
7. **`a`**: Extracted from `case['array']`, which is the fourth element of the tuple representing the current test case.
8. **`freq`**: An empty dictionary used to store frequency counts (not directly relevant to this print statement).
9. **`beautiful_count`**: An integer initialized to 0 (not directly relevant to this print statement).

Given the print statement:
```python
print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
```

We need to determine the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` based on the initial state.

- **`n`**: This is the length of the array `a` for the current test case.
- **`x`**: This is an integer provided in the current test case.
- **`y`**: This is another integer provided in the current test case.
- **`a`**: This is the array of integers provided in the current test case.

Since the exact values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` depend on the specific test case being processed, we cannot provide concrete numerical values without knowing the specific test case. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Therefore, the output will be a formatted string showing the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` for the current test case.

Output: **Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a] (where n is the length of the array a, x and y are integers provided in the test case, and a is the array of integers provided in the test case)**
