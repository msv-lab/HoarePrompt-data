Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case and the newly appended `beautiful_count`, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is `case['array']`, `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair encountered during the loop, `beautiful_count` is the total count of "beautiful" pairs found during the loop.`results` now includes an additional element which is the current value of `beautiful_count`.**

In simpler terms, the `results` list now has one more entry, which is the value of `beautiful_count` from the latest test case processed. All other variables retain their previous values.
