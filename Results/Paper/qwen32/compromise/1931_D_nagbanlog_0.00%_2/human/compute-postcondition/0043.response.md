To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the context of the code snippet:

1. **Variables and their meanings:**
   - `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `test_cases`: A list containing at least one test case. Each test case is a tuple `(n, x, y, a)`, where:
     - `n`: An integer representing the length of the array `a`.
     - `x`: An integer used in calculating the modulo operation.
     - `y`: Another integer used in calculating the modulo operation.
     - `a`: A list of integers.
   - `results`: An empty list that presumably stores results of processing each test case.
   - `n`, `x`, and `y`: These are extracted from the `params` attribute of each test case.
   - `a`: This is the `array` attribute of each test case.
   - `freq`: A dictionary that keeps track of the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs seen in the array `a`.
   - `beautiful_count`: This variable holds the total number of "beautiful" pairs found during the processing of the array `a`.

2. **Processing logic:**
   - For each test case, the code likely iterates through the array `a`, calculates `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs for each element, updates the `freq` dictionary, and counts the number of "beautiful" pairs based on some criteria.
   - After processing all elements in `a` for a particular test case, the `beautiful_count` is determined.
   - The `print` statement outputs the `beautiful_count` for the current test case.

Given this context, the `print` statement will output the total count of "beautiful" pairs found after processing the current test case.

**Output Description:**
The `print` statement will output the `beautiful_count`, which is the total number of "beautiful" pairs found in the array `a` for the current test case.

Output: **Beautiful pairs count: [beautiful_count] (where beautiful_count is the total number of "beautiful" pairs found in the array `a` for the current test case)**
