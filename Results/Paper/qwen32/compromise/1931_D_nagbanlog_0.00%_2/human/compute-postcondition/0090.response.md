The code snippet assigns the values from the dictionary `case['params']` to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. This means that `n`, `x`, and `y` will now hold the respective values from the `params` dictionary of the current test case.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case and the newly appended `beautiful_count`, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`**.
