The only variable in the loop head is `num`, which iterates over the elements in the list `a`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how `num` changes.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a).
- `results` is an empty list.
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from `case['params']`.
- `a` is `case['array']` and must contain at least one element.
- `freq` is a dictionary where the count of `(mod_x, mod_y)` has been incremented by 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` was the current element being processed from the list `a`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be updated to the next element in the list `a`.

Let's assume that in the previous iteration, `num` was the `k`-th element of `a`. In the next iteration, `num` should be the `(k+1)`-th element of `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary where the count of `(mod_x, mod_y)` has been incremented by 1, `num` is the next element in the list `a`**.

Since we don't know the exact position of `num` in the previous iteration, we can denote the new state as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary where the count of `(mod_x, mod_y)` has been incremented by 1, `num` is the next element in the list `a` after the previously processed element**.
