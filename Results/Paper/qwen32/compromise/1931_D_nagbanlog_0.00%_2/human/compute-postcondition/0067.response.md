The given code snippet calculates `required_mod_x` using the formula `(x - mod_x) % x`. This calculation updates the value of `required_mod_x` based on the current values of `x` and `mod_x`.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `test_cases` remains a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a).
- `results` remains a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case.
- `case` remains the next test case in `test_cases`.
- `n` remains the first element of `case['params']`.
- `x` remains the second element of `case['params']`.
- `y` remains the third element of `case['params']`.
- `a` remains `case['array']` and must contain at least one element.
- `freq` remains a dictionary with `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1.
- `mod_x` remains `num % x`.
- `mod_y` remains `num % y`.
- `num` remains the first element of `a`.
- `required_mod_x` is now calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary with `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `num` is the first element of `a`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.**
