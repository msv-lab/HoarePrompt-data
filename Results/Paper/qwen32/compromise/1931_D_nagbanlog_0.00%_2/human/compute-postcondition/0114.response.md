The given code snippet increments the `beautiful_count` by the frequency of pairs `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in the `freq` dictionary. Here's the updated state after the code execution:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case and the newly appended `beautiful_count`, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `num` is the next element in `a`, `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`.**

In simpler terms, the `beautiful_count` has been updated by adding the frequency of the pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in the `freq` dictionary. All other variables retain their previous values.
