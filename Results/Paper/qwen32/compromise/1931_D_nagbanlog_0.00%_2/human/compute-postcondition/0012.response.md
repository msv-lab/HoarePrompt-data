Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a).
- `results` is an empty list.
- For each test case in `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are extracted from `case['params']`, and `a` is extracted from `case['array']`.
- `freq` is an empty dictionary.
- `beautiful_count` is initialized to 0.
- `mod_x` is calculated as `y % x`.
- `mod_y` is calculated as `x % y`.
- `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - (y % x)) % x`.
- `required_mod_y` is calculated as `x % y`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(
    f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
)
```

From the initial state, we know the following:
- `mod_x` is `y % x`.
- `mod_y` is `x % y`.
- `required_mod_x` is `(x - (y % x)) % x`.
- `required_mod_y` is `x % y`.

However, there is no explicit mention of the variable `num` in the initial state. Given the context, it seems like `num` might be intended to represent some value related to the current test case, but since it is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value.

### Conclusion:
Given the provided initial state, we can describe the values of `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` in terms of `x` and `y`. However, `num` remains undefined.

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: y % x, mod_y: x % y, required_mod_x: (x - (y % x)) % x, required_mod_y: x % y (where num is the value of num, x and y are the parameters from the current test case)**
