The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`. Therefore, we need to adjust `num` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case
- `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case and the newly appended `beautiful_count`
- `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`
- `n` is `case['params'][0]`
- `x` is `case['params'][1]`
- `y` is `case['params'][2]`
- `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element
- `mod_x` is `num % x`
- `mod_y` is `num % y`
- `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`
- `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`
- `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1
- `num` is the next element in `a`
- If `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not in `freq`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is set to 0 before incrementing
- If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`

For the loop to execute one more time, `num` should be updated to the next element in the array `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case and the newly appended `beautiful_count`, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element, `num` is the next element in `a`**
