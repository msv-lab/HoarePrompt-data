To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

The code snippet is:
```python
beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
```

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a)
- `results` is an empty list
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from `case['params']`
- `a` is `case['array']` and must contain at least one element
- `freq` is a dictionary with the count of `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1
- `mod_x` is `num % x`
- `mod_y` is `num % y`
- `required_mod_x` is `(x - (num % x)) % x`
- `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`
- `num` is the next element in `a`

The line of code increments `beautiful_count` by the value stored in `freq` for the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)`. 

Since the exact values of `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` depend on the current `num` being processed, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `beautiful_count` without knowing these values. However, we can express the updated state in terms of the existing variables.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary with the count of `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - (num % x)) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `num` is the next element in `a`, `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`.**
