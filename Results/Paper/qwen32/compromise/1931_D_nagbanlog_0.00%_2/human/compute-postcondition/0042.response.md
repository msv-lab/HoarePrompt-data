Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']`, `freq` is a dictionary with counts of all `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs seen in `a`, `beautiful_count` is the total number of "beautiful" pairs found based on the criteria in the loop, and the loop has finished processing all elements in `a`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, the state will include:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it represents the number of test cases.
- `test_cases` remains unchanged as it holds the input data.
- `results` remains an empty list since no results are appended in the provided loop.
- `n`, `x`, and `y` remain as they were initially extracted from the current test case's parameters.
- `a` remains unchanged as it holds the array of numbers being processed.
- `freq` is now a dictionary that contains the frequency of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair encountered in the array `a`.
- `beautiful_count` holds the total number of times a pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` was found in the `freq` dictionary during the loop's execution, indicating how many "beautiful" pairs were identified.
