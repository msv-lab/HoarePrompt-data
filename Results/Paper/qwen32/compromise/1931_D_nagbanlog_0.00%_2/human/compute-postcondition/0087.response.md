To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and understand the context:

- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case.
- `results` is a list that contains the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case.
- `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`.
- `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, representing the length of the array `a`.
- `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, representing a parameter used in calculating the modulus.
- `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, representing another parameter used in calculating the modulus.
- `a` is `case['array']` and must contain at least one element.
- `freq` is a dictionary that increments `(mod_x, mod_y)` by 1 for each occurrence in `a`, where `mod_x` is the element modulo `x` and `mod_y` is the element modulo `y`.
- `beautiful_count` is the total count of beautiful pairs found in `a`.

A "beautiful pair" is typically defined in problems involving pairs of elements that meet certain criteria, often related to their modular properties. However, the exact definition of a "beautiful pair" isn't explicitly stated here, but it is counted and stored in `beautiful_count`.

Given this context, the `print` statement will output the value of `beautiful_count`, which is the total count of beautiful pairs found in the current test case array `a`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **Beautiful pairs count: [beautiful_count] (where beautiful_count is the total count of beautiful pairs found in the array `a` of the current test case)**

This output reflects the precise value of `beautiful_count` as determined by the logic processing the current test case.
