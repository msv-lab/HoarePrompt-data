The code snippet assigns the value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. No other variables are modified.

Given the initial state, the value of `required_mod_y` is now explicitly set to `mod_y`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary with `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `num` is the first element of `a`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.**
