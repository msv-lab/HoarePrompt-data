To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given information. The loop iterates over each element `num` in the array `a`, calculates certain modulo values, and updates the `beautiful_count` based on these values.

Here's a summary of the steps involved in each iteration:
1. For each `num` in `a`, compute `mod_x = num % x` and `mod_y = num % y`.
2. Compute `required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x` and `required_mod_y = mod_y`.
3. Check if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in the frequency dictionary `freq`. If it does, add the corresponding value to `beautiful_count`.
4. Update the frequency dictionary `freq` with the key `(mod_x, mod_y)`. If the key doesn't exist, initialize it to 0 before incrementing.

After all iterations, the final state will include the fully computed `beautiful_count` and the complete frequency dictionary `freq`.

### Final Output State:
- `t` remains the same as the initial integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `test_cases` remains the same list of test cases.
- `results` will contain the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case and the newly appended `beautiful_count` after processing the current test case.
- `case` remains the current test case being processed.
- `n`, `x`, and `y` remain the parameters of the current test case.
- `a` remains the array of numbers from the current test case.
- `freq` will be a dictionary containing the frequency of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair encountered during the loop.
- `beautiful_count` will be the total count of "beautiful" pairs found during the loop.

### Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case and the newly appended `beautiful_count`, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is `case['array']`, `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair encountered during the loop, `beautiful_count` is the total count of "beautiful" pairs found during the loop.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all iterations, `beautiful_count` will reflect the total number of "beautiful" pairs found, and `freq` will have the count of how many times each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair appeared in the array `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or intermediate states as described in the problem statement.
