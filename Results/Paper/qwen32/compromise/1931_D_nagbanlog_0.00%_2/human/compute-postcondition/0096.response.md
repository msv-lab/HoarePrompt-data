The code snippet calculates the modulus of `num` with `x` and assigns it to `mod_x`. However, the variable `num` is not defined in the given initial state. Assuming `num` is intended to be `n` (as it's the only variable among `n`, `x`, and `y` that could logically be used here), the calculation would be `n % x`.

Given this assumption, the updated state would include the new variable `mod_x` with the calculated value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case and the newly appended `beautiful_count`, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0, `mod_x` is `n % x`**.
