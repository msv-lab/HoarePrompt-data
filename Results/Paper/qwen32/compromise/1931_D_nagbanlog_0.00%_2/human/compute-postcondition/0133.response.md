Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from all processed test cases, `case` is the last test case in `test_cases`, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is `case['array']`, `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair encountered during the last iteration of the loop, `beautiful_count` is the total count of "beautiful" pairs found during the last iteration of the loop. All test cases have been processed and their respective `beautiful_count` values have been appended to `results`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `results` will contain the count of "beautiful" pairs for each test case processed. The loop has gone through every test case in `test_cases`, calculated the number of beautiful pairs for each, and stored these counts in the `results` list. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `freq`, and `beautiful_count` will reflect the state of the last test case processed.
