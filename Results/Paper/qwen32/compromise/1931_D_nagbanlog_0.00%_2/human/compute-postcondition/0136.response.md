Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the number of "beautiful" pairs based on specific modular conditions involving `x` and `y`, and returns a list of these counts for all test cases.**
