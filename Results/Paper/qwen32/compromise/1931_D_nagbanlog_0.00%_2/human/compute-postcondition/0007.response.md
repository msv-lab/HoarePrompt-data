In the given task, the for loop iterates over the list `a`. To ensure that the loop executes, we need to focus on the list `a` and the variable `num` in the loop head.

Here's the analysis:

- The loop is defined as `for num in a:`, which means the loop will iterate over each element in the list `a`.
- For the loop to execute at least once, the list `a` must contain at least one element.
- The variable `num` is initialized to the first element of `a` during the first iteration of the loop, but its initial state before the loop starts is not relevant because it gets assigned a value from `a` during the first iteration.

Given this, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `a` contains at least one element. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `freq`, and `beautiful_count`) are not directly involved in the execution of this specific for loop and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a) with 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `results` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0**
