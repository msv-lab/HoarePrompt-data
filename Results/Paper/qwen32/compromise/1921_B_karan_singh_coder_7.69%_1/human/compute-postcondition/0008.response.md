The code snippet `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` increments the variable `cnt` by 1 if the characters at position `i` in strings `s` and `t` are not equal. Since `cnt` is initially 0, it will be incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`, otherwise, it will remain 0.

Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `s1`, `t1`, and `cnt` remain unchanged except for `cnt`, which is incremented based on the comparison of `s[i]` and `t[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is a string representing the input, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the input string, `s1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in `t`, `cnt` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`.**
