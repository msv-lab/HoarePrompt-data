The code snippet `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` will increment `cnt` by 1 if the characters at index `i` in strings `s` and `t` are not equal. Given the initial state, `i` is set to `n`, and the condition `n > n+1` is impossible, implying `n` must be set to a value that makes this condition false. Therefore, let's assume `n` is a valid index for both `s` and `t`.

The output state will be:
- `t` remains the new input string.
- `n` remains the value it was initially set to (though the condition `n > n+1` is contradictory and should be re-evaluated in a real scenario).
- `s` remains the new input string.
- `s1` remains the count of '1's in the new `s`.
- `t1` remains the count of '1's in the new `t`.
- `i` remains `n`.
- `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is the new input string, `n` must be greater than `n+1` (contradictory condition), `s` is the new input string, `s1` is the count of '1's in the new `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in the new `t`, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`.**
