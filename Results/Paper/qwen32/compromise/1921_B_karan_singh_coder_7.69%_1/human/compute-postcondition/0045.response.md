The code snippet `s1 = s.count('1')` updates the value of `s1` to be the count of '1's in the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the new input string, `n` is the input integer from the user, `s` is the new input string, `s1` is the count of '1's in the new `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in the new `t`, and `cnt` is the number of positions where `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.**
