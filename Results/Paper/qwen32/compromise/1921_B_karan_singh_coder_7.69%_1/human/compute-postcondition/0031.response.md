The code snippet increments `cnt` by 1 if the characters at index `i` in strings `s` and `t` are not equal. The value of `i` is then incremented by 1. Other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `cnt` is increased by 1 if `s[i] != t[i]`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`. The conditions `n > i + 1`, the counts `s1` and `t1`, and the strings `t` and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the new input string, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `s` is the new input string, `s1` is the count of '1's in the new `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in `t`, `cnt` is increased by 1 if `s[i] != t[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
