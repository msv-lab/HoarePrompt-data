The code snippet `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` increments `cnt` by 1 if the characters at the `i`-th position in strings `s` and `t` are not equal. Given the initial state, `i` is incremented by 2 in the previous step, so we need to consider the characters at the new `i` position.

Output State: **`t` is the new input string, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`, `s` is the new input string, `s1` is the count of '1's in the new `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in `t`, `cnt` is increased by 1 if `s[i] != t[i]`, `i` is `i + 2`. The value of `cnt` has been updated based on whether `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `cnt` has been adjusted by 1 if the characters at the new `i` position in `s` and `t` are different. All other variables retain their previous states except for `cnt`, which has been updated.
