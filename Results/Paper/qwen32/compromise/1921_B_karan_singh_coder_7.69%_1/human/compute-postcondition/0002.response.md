`s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which means `s` will hold the string input provided by the user. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the integer value of `t`; `s` is the input string.**
