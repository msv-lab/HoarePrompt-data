The code snippet provided initializes a variable `cnt` to 0. This does not affect any of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `s1`, `t1`). Therefore, the output state simply reflects the initialization of `cnt`.

Output State: **`t` is a string representing the input; `n` is the integer value of the input; `s` is the input string; `s1` is the count of '1's in `s`; `t1` is the count of '1's in `t`; `cnt` is 0.**
