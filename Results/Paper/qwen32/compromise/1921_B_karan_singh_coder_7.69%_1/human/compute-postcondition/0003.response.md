The code snippet `t = input()` changes the type of `t` from an integer to a string, as `input()` always returns a string. The value of `t` is now the string representation of whatever was input. The variable `n` still holds the previous integer value of `t` before the input operation. The variable `s` remains unchanged as it is the input string.

Output State: **`t` is a string representing the input; `n` is the integer value of the input; `s` is the input string.**
