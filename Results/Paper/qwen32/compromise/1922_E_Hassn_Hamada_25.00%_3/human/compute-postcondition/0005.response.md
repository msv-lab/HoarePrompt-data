To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop:

The loop condition is:
```
while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number:
```

This condition can be broken down as follows:
- `1 << size + 1` is a bitwise left shift operation, which is equivalent to `2^(size + 1)`.
- The loop will execute if `2^(size + 1) - 1` is less than or equal to `number`.

Given the initial state:
- `number` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000).
- `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) represents the number of increasing subsequences required for each test case.
- `size` is 1.

Let's substitute `size = 1` into the condition:
- `2^(1 + 1) - 1 = 2^2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3`.

So, the loop condition becomes:
- `3 <= number`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `number` must be at least 3. If `number` is less than 3, the loop will not execute.

Now, let's adjust the state accordingly:

State: **`number` must be at least 3, `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18), `size` is 1**

This ensures that the condition `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number` is satisfied for the first iteration of the loop.
