Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `a` is now the new list of `n` integers provided by the user input, `max` is 0. If `n` is equal to 2, `max` remains unchanged as there are no slices of 3 consecutive elements in the array `a`. Otherwise, `max` is the maximum value of the middle elements of all possible slices of 3 consecutive elements in the array `a`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 2):
    temp = a[i:i + 3]
    temp.sort()
    if temp[1] > max:
        max = temp[1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input and must be at least 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by the user input, `i` is 0, `temp` is a sorted list containing the first three elements of `a` in non-decreasing order. If the second element of `temp` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to the second element of `temp`. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input and must be at least 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by the user input, `i` is 1, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]` in ascending order. If the second element of `temp` (before sorting) was greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to that value; otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is an integer value provided by the user input and must be at least 3; `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by the user input; `i` is 2; `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[2]`, `a[3]`, and `a[4]`; `max` is updated to be the second element of the sorted list `temp` if the second element of `temp` (before sorting) was greater than the original `max`; otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
