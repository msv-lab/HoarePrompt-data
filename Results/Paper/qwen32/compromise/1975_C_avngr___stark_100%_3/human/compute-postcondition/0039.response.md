Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input and must be at least 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by the user input, `i` is 0, `temp` is a sorted list containing the first three elements of `a` in non-decreasing order. If the second element of `temp` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to the second element of `temp`. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.**
