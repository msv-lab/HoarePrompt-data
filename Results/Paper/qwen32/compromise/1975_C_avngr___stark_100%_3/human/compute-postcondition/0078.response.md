Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a`, followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the elements of the array. The function processes up to 500 test cases, with the total number of elements across all test cases not exceeding 100,000. For each test case, the function returns the maximum value found in the array `a`.**
