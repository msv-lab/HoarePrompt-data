You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 500) and a list of n-1 integers x_2, x_3, ..., x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500). The sum of all n values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to construct an array `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that:
  - `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` for all `1 <= i <= n`.
  - `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`.
- We are given `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n` and need to find `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input('')
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        a = [1000]
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The array `a` is initialized with `a[0] = 1000`. This is a valid starting point since `1000` is within the range `[1, 10^9]`.

2. **Loop**:
   - For each `i` from `1` to `n-1`, the program sets `a[i] = a[i-1] + T[i-1]`.
   - This ensures that `a[i]` is always greater than `a[i-1]` and `a[i]` is within the range `[1, 10^9]` as long as `T[i-1]` is within `[1, 500]` and `a[i-1]` does not exceed `10^9 - 500`.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` needs to be checked. Given the construction `a[i] = a[i-1] + T[i-1]`, we have:
     - `a[i] % a[i-1] = (a[i-1] + T[i-1]) % a[i-1] = T[i-1] % a[i-1]`.
     - Since `T[i-1] < a[i-1]` (because `T[i-1]` is at most `500` and `a[i-1]` starts from `1000` and increases by at most `500` each time), `T[i-1] % a[i-1] = T[i-1]`.
     - Therefore, `a[i] % a[i-1] = T[i-1] = x_i`, which satisfies the condition.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly constructs the array `a` such that `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n` and ensures that all `a_i` are within the range `[1, 10^9]`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**. The program correctly constructs the required array `a` for all valid inputs as per the problem description.
