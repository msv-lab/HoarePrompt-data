You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input('')
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        a = [1000]
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n-1` integers. For each test case, it calculates a new list where each element is the cumulative sum starting from 1000, adding each integer from the input list sequentially. It then prints this new list as a space-separated string for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find an array `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that:
1. Each `a_i` is between 1 and \(10^9\).
2. For every `i` from 2 to `n`, `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}`.

Given an array `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n`, we need to construct the array `a` that satisfies the above conditions.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the input and processes each test case as follows:
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and the array `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n`.
- It initializes the array `a` with a single element `1000`.
- For each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, it appends `a[i-1] + T[i-1]` to `a`.
- It prints the array `a` for each test case.

### Verification:
The program's logic is flawed. Let's examine the construction of the array `a`:
- The program initializes `a` with `[1000]`.
- For each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, it appends `a[i-1] + T[i-1]` to `a`.

This means that `a_2` will be `1000 + x_2`, `a_3` will be `a_2 + x_3`, and so on. However, this construction does not guarantee that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` for all `i` from 2 to `n`.

### Correctness Check:
Let's consider the first example provided in the problem:
- Input: `4 2 4 1`
- Expected Output: `a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4` such that:
  - `a_2 % a_1 = 2`
  - `a_3 % a_2 = 4`
  - `a_4 % a_3 = 1`

If the program follows its logic:
- `a_1 = 1000`
- `a_2 = 1000 + 2 = 1002`
- `a_3 = 1002 + 4 = 1006`
- `a_4 = 1006 + 1 = 1007`

However:
- `a_2 % a_1 = 1002 % 1000 = 2` (correct)
- `a_3 % a_2 = 1006 % 1002 = 4` (correct)
- `a_4 % a_3 = 1007 % 1006 = 1` (correct)

While the program's output for this specific example happens to be correct, it does not guarantee correctness for all possible inputs. The logic used in the program is not robust enough to ensure that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` for all `i` from 2 to `n`.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not provide a general solution to the problem. While it may produce correct results for some test cases, it does not guarantee correctness for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
