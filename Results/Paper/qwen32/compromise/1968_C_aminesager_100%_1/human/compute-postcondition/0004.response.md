The code snippet provided is `line = input('')`, which means it will take a line of input from the user. The initial state of the variables is not affected by the input operation directly, except for the new variable `line` that will hold the input value.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer minus 1, `n` is the integer value provided by user input (2 <= n <= 500), `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n` are a list of n-1 integers (1 <= x_i <= 500), `line` is the string input by the user.**
