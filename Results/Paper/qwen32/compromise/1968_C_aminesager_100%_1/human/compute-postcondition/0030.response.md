Let's break down the given information and determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is initialized to 0.
2. `n` is an integer provided by user input, where \(2 \leq n \leq 500\).
3. `line` is a string input by the user.
4. `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting the string `line`.
5. `a` is a list calculated as:
   - The first element is 1000.
   - The second element is \(1000 + T[0]\).
   - The third element is \((1000 + T[0]) + T[1]\).
   - And so on, until the \(n\)-th element which is \((1000 + T[0] + T[1] + \ldots + T[n-2]) + T[n-1]\).
6. `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The user inputs an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 500).
   - The user then inputs a string `line` which is split into a list of integers `T`.

2. **List `a` Construction**:
   - The list `a` is constructed as follows:
     - `a[0] = 1000`
     - For \(i = 1\) to \(n-1\), `a[i] = a[i-1] + T[i-1]`
     This means that each subsequent element in `a` is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `T`.

3. **String `result` Construction**:
   - The `result` string is formed by joining all the elements of `a` with a space.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume the user inputs:
- `n = 4`
- `line = "10 20 30"`

This results in:
- `T = [10, 20, 30]`
- `a` is calculated as:
  - `a[0] = 1000`
  - `a[1] = 1000 + 10 = 1010`
  - `a[2] = 1010 + 20 = 1030`
  - `a[3] = 1030 + 30 = 1060`
- `result = "1000 1010 1030 1060"`

### Output Explanation:
The `print(result)` statement will output the space-separated string of the elements in the list `a`.

Output: **1000 1010 1030 1060 (where the numbers are the cumulative sums starting from 1000 with the values from the list T added sequentially)**

### General Output:
Given the initial state and the steps above, the output will be a space-separated string of the cumulative sums starting from 1000 with the values from the list `T` added sequentially.

Output: **1000 [1000 + T[0]] [1000 + T[0] + T[1]] ... [1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-1]] (where each term in brackets represents the cumulative sum as described)**
