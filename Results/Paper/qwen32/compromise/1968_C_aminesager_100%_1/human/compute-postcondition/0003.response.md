The code snippet `n = int(input())` will change the value of `n` to the integer value provided by the user input. The initial state specified that `n` was an integer between 2 and 500. However, after the execution of the code, `n` will be whatever integer value is entered by the user, as long as it fits within the constraints of the `int` type in Python (which is quite large).

The other variables, `t` and `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n`, are not affected by this line of code and retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer minus 1, `n` is the integer value provided by user input (2 <= n <= 500), `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n` are a list of n-1 integers (1 <= x_i <= 500).**
