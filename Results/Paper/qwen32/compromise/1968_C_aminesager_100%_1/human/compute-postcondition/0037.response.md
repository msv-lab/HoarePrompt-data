To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n):`. This means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `n`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `n`:** The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1. The problem states that `n` is an input integer with the constraint `2 <= n <= 500`. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `n` as it is already within the required range.

2. **Variable `i`:** The loop variable `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n-1`. Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to the initial value of the range, which is 1.

The other variables (`t`, `T`, `line`, `a`, `result`) are not part of the loop head and, therefore, do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be 1.

State: **`t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer (2 <= n <= 500), `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting the new string `line`, `line` is the new string input by the user, `a` is [1000], `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`, `i` is 1**
