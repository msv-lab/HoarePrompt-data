The function reads a number of test cases and for each test case, it processes six integers representing the dimensions of a rectangle and the coordinates of two points within that rectangle. It then determines and prints whether a player named Alice or Bob wins or if the game is a Draw based on the positions of the points and the rules defined in the code.
