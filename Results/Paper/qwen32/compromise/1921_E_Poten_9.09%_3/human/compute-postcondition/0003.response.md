To determine the output state, we need to understand what the loop does and how it modifies the `answers` list based on the input `clues` provided in each iteration. The loop iterates `test_cases` times, and in each iteration, it reads a list of integers `clues` and appends a string ('Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw') to the `answers` list based on certain conditions.

Since the exact input values for `clues` are not provided, we can't determine the specific contents of the `answers` list. However, we can describe the state of `answers` in a general form after all iterations are completed.

Given that the loop appends a result for each test case, the `answers` list will contain exactly `test_cases` elements, each being one of 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw'.

Therefore, the output state can be described as:

Output State: **`answers` is a list of length `test_cases` containing strings 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw'.**
