Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game for all possible cases. There are several issues and missing logic in the program that need to be addressed:

1. **Alice's and Bob's Movement Logic:** The program does not correctly implement the movement logic for both players. Alice can move down, down-left, or down-right, while Bob can move up, up-left, or up-right. The program incorrectly uses conditions involving the parity of the row positions to determine the winner, which does not accurately reflect the movement rules.

2. **Edge Cases:** The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example:
   - If Alice is in the last row (`x_a = h`), she cannot make any moves, and the game should end in a draw.
   - If Bob is in the first row (`x_b = 1`), he cannot make any moves, and the game should end in a draw.
   - The program does not correctly handle scenarios where Alice and Bob are in the same column but different rows, or vice versa.

3. **Simplification of the Problem:** The problem can be simplified by considering the relative positions of Alice and Bob. If Alice can reach Bob's position before Bob can reach Alice's position, Alice wins. If Bob can reach Alice's position before Alice can reach Bob's position, Bob wins. If neither can reach the other, the game is a draw.

Here is an example of a case where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
3 3 1 1 3 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Draw
```

**Explanation of the Case:**
- Alice starts at (1, 1) and Bob starts at (3, 3).
- Alice can move to (2, 1), (2, 2), or (2, 3).
- Bob can move to (2, 3), (2, 2), or (2, 1).
- Regardless of Alice's move, Bob can always move to the same cell in his next turn, and vice versa.
- Therefore, neither player can win, and the game ends in a draw.

The provided program does not correctly handle this scenario and would likely output an incorrect result. Thus, the program is incorrect.
