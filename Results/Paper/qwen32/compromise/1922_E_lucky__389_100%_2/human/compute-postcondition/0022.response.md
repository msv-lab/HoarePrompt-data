The given code snippet updates the variable `mx` by comparing it with `i - 1` and taking the maximum of the two. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `mx` or `i`. Since `mx` is updated based on the comparison, we need to consider its potential new value. The values of `t` and `X` remain unchanged, and `x` is described as an integer decreased by 2, but its exact value is not specified and is not affected by the code snippet.

Given that `mx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i - 1`, the output state will reflect this change. We do not have the initial value of `mx` or `i`, so we will express the output state in terms of `mx` and `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is an integer decreased by 2, `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `i - 1`.**
