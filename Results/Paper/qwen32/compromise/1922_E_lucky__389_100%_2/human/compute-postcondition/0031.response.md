Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is at least 8; `subseq_lens` is an empty list; `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `i - 1` if `i` is not 0; `i` is 4.**

In this output state, the only change is that the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, making it 4. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
