To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition `2 ** i <= x`. The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18.
- `x` is any non-zero integer and `x` must be at least 1.
- `subseq_lens` is an empty list.
- `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `i - 1` if `i` is not 0.
- `i` is 1.

The loop condition is `2 ** i <= x`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need `2 ** i` to be less than or equal to `x`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again:
- `2 ** 1` (which is 2) should be less than or equal to `x`.

Since `x` must be at least 1, to ensure the loop can execute again, `x` should be at least 2.

No other states need to be adjusted because only `i` and `x` are in the loop head, and `i` is already set to 1, which is appropriate for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure `x` is at least 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is any non-zero integer and `x` must be at least 2; `subseq_lens` is an empty list; `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `i - 1` if `i` is not 0; `i` is 1**
