Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to find an array of integers such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The program seems to be attempting to solve the problem by decomposing the number `X` into a sum of powers of 2 and then constructing an array based on these powers.

However, the current implementation has several issues:
1. The program does not correctly construct an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. Instead, it prints the lengths of the subsequences of powers of 2 that sum up to `X`, which is not the required output.
2. The array construction part of the program is flawed. The array `ansv` is not correctly derived to meet the problem's requirements.
3. The program does not handle cases where `X` cannot be represented as a sum of powers of 2 in a way that corresponds to the number of increasing subsequences of an array.
4. The program does not account for the requirement that the array should have a length of at most 200 and elements in the range [-10^9, 10^9].

Given the above points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is False.

Correctness: **False**
