The code snippet `a = a[::-1]` reverses the list `a`. This means that the order of elements in `a` is flipped.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1
- `n` is the input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500
- `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 500
- `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in the input string `line` to integers
- `a` is a list containing the integers [1000, 1000 - T[0], 1000 - T[0] - T[1], ..., 1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2]]

After executing `a = a[::-1]`, the list `a` will be reversed. So, the first element of the original list `a` will become the last element, the second element will become the second-to-last element, and so on.

For example, if the original list `a` was `[1000, 900, 800, 700]`, after reversing, it would become `[700, 800, 900, 1000]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 500; `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in the input string `line` to integers; `a` is a list containing the integers [1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2], ..., 1000 - T[0] - T[1], 1000 - T[0], 1000] in reverse order.**
