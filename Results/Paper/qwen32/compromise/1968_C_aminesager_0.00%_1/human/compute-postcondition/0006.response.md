Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 500; `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in the input string `line` to integers; `a` is a list containing the single integer 1000.**

In simple terms, the only change is that a new list `a` has been created and initialized with the single integer `1000`. All other variables retain their original values and conditions.
