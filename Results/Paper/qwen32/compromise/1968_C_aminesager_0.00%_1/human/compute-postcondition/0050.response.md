Output State: **`t` is 0; no further iterations occur; the final `result` printed for each iteration is a space-separated string of `n` integers where each integer is calculated as 1000 minus the cumulative sum of the first (i-1) elements of `T`, in reverse order.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be 0, indicating that the loop has terminated. For each iteration, the program calculates a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer is derived by subtracting the cumulative sum of the first (i-1) elements of the input list `T` from 1000, and then reverses this list. The final `result` for each iteration is printed as a space-separated string of these integers. No further iterations will occur because `t` has reached 0.
