To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop statement. The loop condition is `while t:` which means the loop will continue as long as `t` is truthy (non-zero).

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is the newly input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500
- `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 500
- `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in the input string `line` to integers
- `a` is a list `[1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]), ..., 1000 - (T[0] + T[1]), 1000 - T[0], 1000]`
- `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`
- `line` is the newly input string
- `i` is `n` and `result` is a space-separated string of the elements in `a`

The only variable in the loop head is `t`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be non-zero. Since `t` is `t - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, to ensure the loop executes again, `t` must be adjusted to a value greater than 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the newly input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 500; `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in the input string `line` to integers; `a` is a list `[1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]), ..., 1000 - (T[0] + T[1]), 1000 - T[0], 1000]`; `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`; `line` is the newly input string; `i` is `n` and `result` is a space-separated string of the elements in `a`.**
