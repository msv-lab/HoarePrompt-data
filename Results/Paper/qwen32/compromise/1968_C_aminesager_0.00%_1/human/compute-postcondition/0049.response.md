To determine the output, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet provided.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **List `a`**: This list is described as being reversed and having `n` elements. Each element at position `i` (starting from 1) in this list is calculated as `1000` minus the sum of the first `(i-1)` elements of another list `T`, but in reverse order.
   
   For example, if `T = [t1, t2, t3, ..., tn]`, then:
   - The first element of `a` would be `1000 - 0` (since there are no previous elements to sum).
   - The second element of `a` would be `1000 - t1`.
   - The third element of `a` would be `1000 - (t1 + t2)`.
   - And so on...

   After calculating these values, the list `a` is reversed.

2. **String `result`**: This is a space-separated string of the elements in the reversed list `a`.

### Code Execution:
The code snippet simply prints the `result` string.

### Determining the Output:
Given the description, the exact numerical values of the elements in `a` depend on the specific values in the list `T`. Since the list `T` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of the elements in `a`.

However, we can describe the output precisely in terms of the list `T`:

- Let's denote the elements of the original list `T` as `t1, t2, ..., tn`.
- The elements of the list `a` before reversing would be:
  - `a1 = 1000 - 0 = 1000`
  - `a2 = 1000 - t1`
  - `a3 = 1000 - (t1 + t2)`
  - ...
  - `an = 1000 - (t1 + t2 + ... + t(n-1))`

- After reversing, the list `a` becomes:
  - `a_reversed = [an, a(n-1), ..., a2, a1]`
  
- The `result` string is a space-separated string of these reversed elements.

### Final Output Description:
The `print(result)` statement will output a space-separated string of the elements in the reversed list `a`, where each element is calculated as `1000` minus the cumulative sum of the previous elements of `T` in reverse order.

Output: **an a(n-1) ... a2 a1 (where each ai is calculated as 1000 minus the cumulative sum of the previous elements of T in reverse order)**
