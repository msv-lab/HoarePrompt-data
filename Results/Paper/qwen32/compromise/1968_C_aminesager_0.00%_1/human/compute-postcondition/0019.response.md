The given code snippet only includes the line `n = int(input())`. This line reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. None of the other variables (`t`, `x`, `T`, `a`, `result`) are affected by this line of code.

Since `n` was previously described as "the input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500," the execution of `n = int(input())` will reassign `n` to whatever integer value is provided by the new input, which should still satisfy the condition 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `n` while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the newly input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 500; `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in the input string `line` to integers; `a` is a list containing the integers [1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2], ..., 1000 - T[0] - T[1], 1000 - T[0], 1000] in reverse order; `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`.**
