The code snippet updates the list `T` by converting the space-separated values in the input string `line` to integers. This means the previous definition of `T` is overwritten.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the newly input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 500; `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in the input string `line` to integers; `a` is a list containing the integers [1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2], ..., 1000 - T[0] - T[1], 1000 - T[0], 1000] in reverse order; `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`; `line` is the newly input string.**

In natural language: The value of `T` is now a list of integers derived from the space-separated values in the input string `line`. All other variables remain unchanged.
