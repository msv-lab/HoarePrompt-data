The code snippet reassigns the variable `a` to a new list containing only the integer `1000`. This means the previous contents of `a` are discarded.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the newly input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 500; `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in the newly input string `line` to integers; `a` is a list `[1000]`; `result` is a space-separated string of the elements in `a`; `line` is the newly input string; `i` is `n`**. 

In simpler terms, the variable `a` is now a list containing just the number `1000`, while all other variables retain their previously defined values.
