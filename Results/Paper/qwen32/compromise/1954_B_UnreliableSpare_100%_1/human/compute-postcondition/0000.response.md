The code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and `t` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= `n`. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
