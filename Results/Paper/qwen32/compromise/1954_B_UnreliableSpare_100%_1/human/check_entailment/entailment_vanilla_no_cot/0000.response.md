Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. 

The program checks if all elements in the array are the same and, if so, outputs -1. However, it does not correctly handle the case where the array is beautiful but not all elements are the same. Specifically, the logic for calculating the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed.

The current approach incorrectly assumes that finding the shortest sequence of consecutive identical elements (other than the entire array) will give the correct answer. This is not the case, as the problem requires removing elements to break the "beauty" condition, which involves the specific pattern of elements described in the problem statement.

Here's a more detailed explanation of why the current approach is incorrect:

1. **Identical Elements Check**: The program correctly identifies when all elements are the same and outputs -1.

2. **Finding Minimum Sequence**: The program tries to find the shortest sequence of consecutive identical elements. However, this does not necessarily mean that removing these elements will make the array stop being beautiful. The "beauty" condition involves specific indices and values, and removing the shortest sequence of identical elements may not break this condition.

3. **Correct Approach**: To solve the problem correctly, one needs to identify the longest sequence of elements that can be made identical using the given operation. Then, the minimum number of elements to remove would be the total number of elements minus the length of this longest sequence. If the entire array can be made identical, the result is -1.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect and needs to be revised to correctly solve the problem as described.
