### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by first checking if the array is already composed of identical elements. If this is the case, the program correctly outputs `-1` because an array with all identical elements will remain beautiful regardless of how many elements are removed.

If the array is not composed of identical elements, the program then tries to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful. This is done by iterating through the array and counting consecutive elements that are equal to the first element of the array (`arr[0]`). The program keeps track of the minimum count of such consecutive elements found (`ans`). 

However, the logic used to determine the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The program only considers the consecutive elements equal to `arr[0]` and does not account for other potential patterns or segments in the array that might require fewer removals to make the array non-beautiful. Therefore, the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove in all cases.

For example, consider the array `[3, 3, 5, 3, 3]`. The program will count the consecutive `3`s at the start and end, but it will not consider removing the `5` in the middle, which would make the array non-beautiful with a single removal.

Thus, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness: **False**
