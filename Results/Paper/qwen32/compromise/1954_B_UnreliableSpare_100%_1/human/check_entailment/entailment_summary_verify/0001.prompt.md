You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program:
import copy, math, random, decimal
from decimal import Decimal

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    (val, cnt) = (arr[0], 0)
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines if all elements in the list are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it finds and prints the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same in the list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array is defined as one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly choosing an index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) such that `a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1}` and replacing `a_i` with `a_{i - 1}`.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `arr`.

2. **Initial Check for Uniform Array**:
   - It initializes a flag `flag` to `True` and iterates through the array to check if all elements are the same.
   - If it finds any two consecutive elements that are different, it sets `flag` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If `flag` remains `True`, it means the array is uniform (all elements are the same), and the program correctly outputs `-1` since a uniform array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

3. **Finding Minimum Removals**:
   - It initializes `ans` to positive infinity (`Decimal('Infinity')`).
   - It then iterates through the array to find the length of the longest contiguous segment of the same value.
   - For each segment, it updates `ans` to the minimum length of such segments.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time to account for the last segment.
   - Finally, it prints `ans` as the result.

### Issues in the Program

- **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Removals**:
  - The logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove is incorrect. The program is trying to find the length of the longest contiguous segment of the same value and then using that to determine the minimum removals, which is not the correct approach.
  - The correct approach should involve identifying the smallest segment that, when removed, breaks the beautiful property of the array. This is not what the current logic does.

### Correctness

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The logic for finding the minimum removals is flawed.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
