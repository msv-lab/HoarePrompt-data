### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by first checking if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it correctly outputs `-1` because no elements can be removed to make the array non-beautiful. If not all elements are the same, it then tries to find the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same and outputs that value.

However, there is a mistake in the logic used to determine the minimum number of elements to remove. The program calculates the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same, but this does not necessarily give the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

For example, consider the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`. The minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same is `1` (for the element `5`), but the correct answer is `3`, which is the number of `3`s that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

The correct approach should involve identifying the longest sequence of elements that can be made uniform using the given operation and then determining the minimum number of elements outside this sequence that need to be removed to disrupt the beauty of the array.

### Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful in all cases.
