Reasoning: The provided program is intended to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it outputs -1 because a uniform array will always remain beautiful no matter how many elements are removed. If the array is not uniform, the program then finds the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same and outputs this value.

The program logic seems correct based on the problem description. However, there is a critical flaw in the logic: the program only checks the length of consecutive elements that are the same starting from the first element (`val = arr[0]`). It does not consider other possible sequences of consecutive elements throughout the array. This means that the program might miss finding the true minimum length of consecutive elements that could be removed to make the array stop being beautiful.

For example, consider the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`. The program will find the first sequence of consecutive `3`s, which is of length 3, and will output 3. However, removing the three `3`s around the `5` would actually make the array stop being beautiful with only one removal, which is the correct answer. The program does not account for this scenario.

To correct this, the program should iterate through the entire array and find the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive elements that are the same, not just starting from the first element.

Given the specific flaw in the program's logic, the current implementation is not correct for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
