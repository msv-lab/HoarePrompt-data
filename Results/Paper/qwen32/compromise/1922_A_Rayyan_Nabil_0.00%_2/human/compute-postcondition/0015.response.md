Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user, `c` is a string input by the user, and `l` is 'YES'**.

In this output state, the variable `l` is explicitly set to `'YES'` by the code, regardless of its previous value. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`) retain their initial values.
