The code assigns the string `'YES'` to the variable `l`. The other variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user, `c` is a string input by the user, `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, `l` is `'YES'`**.
