To determine the output of the `print(l)` statement, we need to analyze the conditions and definitions provided in the initial state.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This variable, however, does not directly influence the value of `l`.
- `i` is set to `n`, where `n` is an input integer. This variable also does not directly influence the value of `l`.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings input by the user.
- `l` is defined as 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`. Otherwise, `l` is 'NO'.

### Analysis:
The value of `l` depends on the comparison of characters at the same index in strings `a`, `b`, and `c`. Specifically, `l` is 'YES' if there is at least one position where the characters in `a` and `b` differ from the character in `c` at that same position.

### Output Determination:
Since the exact strings `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `l` (either 'YES' or 'NO'). However, based on the definition, we can describe the output as follows:

- If there is at least one index `i` where `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`, then `l` will be 'YES'.
- Otherwise, `l` will be 'NO'.

### Final Output:
Output: **l (where l is 'YES' if there exists at least one index i such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]; otherwise, 'NO')**
