To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop and its effects on the variables.

Here is the loop again for reference:
```python
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
        l = 'YES'
else:
    l = 'NO'
```

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Loop Iterations**: The loop runs `n` times, where `n` is the length of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
2. **Condition Check**: During each iteration `i`, the loop checks if `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`.
3. **Variable `l` Update**: 
   - If the condition is true for any iteration, `l` is set to `'YES'`.
   - If the condition is never true for any of the iterations, `l` remains `'NO'` after the loop.

### Output State After All Iterations:
- **Variable `i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`.
- **Variable `l`**: 
  - If at least one iteration had `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`, `l` will be `'YES'`.
  - If no iterations had `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`, `l` will be `'NO'`.
- **Other Variables**: The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

### Final Output State:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000.
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `n` remains the input integer.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` remain the input strings.
- `l` is either `'YES'` or `'NO'` based on the condition checks during the loop.

### Conclusion:
The final output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is `n`, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user, `c` is a string input by the user, and `l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`; otherwise, `l` is 'NO'.**
