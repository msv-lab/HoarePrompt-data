The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, which is equal to the value of `i` from the previous iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a newly input string, `b` is a newly input string, `c` is a newly input string, and `l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`; otherwise, `l` is 'NO'.**
