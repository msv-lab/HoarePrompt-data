To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior and the conditions provided.

The loop iterates over the range of `n`, which means it will execute `n` times. During each iteration, it checks if the characters at the current index `i` in strings `a` and `b` are both different from the character at the same index in string `c`. If this condition is met for any index, the variable `l` is set to 'YES'. If the loop completes without finding such an index, `l` will be set to 'NO'.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the final value of `l` is determined by whether the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` holds true for any index `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it defines the range of the loop.
- **`a`**: Remains unchanged as it is only used for comparison.
- **`b`**: Remains unchanged as it is only used for comparison.
- **`c`**: Remains unchanged as it is only used for comparison.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`.
- **`l`**: Will be 'YES' if there is at least one index `i` such that `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]`. Otherwise, it will be 'NO'.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations of the loop is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a newly input string, `b` is a newly input string, `c` is a newly input string, and `l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`; otherwise, `l` is 'NO'.**

In simple terms, after all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, and `l` will be 'YES' if any character in `a` and `b` at the same position is different from the character in `c` at that position; otherwise, `l` will be 'NO'.
