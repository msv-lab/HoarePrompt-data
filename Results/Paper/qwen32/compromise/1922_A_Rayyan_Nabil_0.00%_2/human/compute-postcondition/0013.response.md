Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user, `c` is a string input by the user, and if `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, then `l` is set to `'YES'`. Otherwise, `l` remains unchanged.**
