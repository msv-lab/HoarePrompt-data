The code snippet provided assigns the string `'YES'` to the variable `l`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 20, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `l` is `'YES'`.**
