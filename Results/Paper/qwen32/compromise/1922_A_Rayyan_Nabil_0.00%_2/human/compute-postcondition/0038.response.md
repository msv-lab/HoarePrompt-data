The code snippet `a = input()` assigns the value of the newly input string to the variable `a`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `b`, `c`, `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is the newly input integer, `a` is the newly input string, `b` is a newly input string, `c` is a newly input string, and `l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`; otherwise, `l` is 'NO'.**
