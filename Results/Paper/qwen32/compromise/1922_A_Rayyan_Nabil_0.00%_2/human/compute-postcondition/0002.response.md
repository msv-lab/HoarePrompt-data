The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `l` do not affect whether the loop will execute, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is 0**
