Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions containing at least one more test case; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` from the current test case; `count` is `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the next test case in `test_cases` with `arr` containing at least one element; `residue_map` is an empty dictionary; `r_x` is `-num % x`; `r_y` is `num % y`.**

In simple terms, `count` is updated to the value retrieved from `residue_map` using the key `(r_x, r_y)`, or 0 if the key does not exist. All other variables remain unchanged.
