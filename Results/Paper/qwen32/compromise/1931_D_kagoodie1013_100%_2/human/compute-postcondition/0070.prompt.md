Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions. Each test case description is a tuple containing three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers (a). Here, n is the size of the array (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), x and y are Polycarp's favorite integers (1 <= x, y <= 10^9), and a is the list of integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The length of the `test_cases` list is t (1 <= t <= 10^4), and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, x, y, arr in test_cases:
    count = 0
    residue_map = {}
    for num in arr:
        r_x = -num % x
        r_y = num % y
        count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
        current_key = num % x, num % y
        residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1
    results.append(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that must contain at least one test case; `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `count` is the total number of pairs (r_x, r_y) that have been seen before for each element in `arr`; `arr` is the list of integers from the first test case in `test_cases`; `residue_map` is a dictionary that maps each unique (num % x, num % y) pair to the number of times it has been encountered; `num` is the last element in `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions containing at least one more test case; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` from the current test case; `count` is the total number of pairs `(r_x, r_y)` that have been seen before during the iteration of the loop; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the next test case in `test_cases` with `arr` fully processed; `residue_map` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each pair `(num % x, num % y)` encountered in `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions containing at least one more test case; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` from the current test case; `count` is the final accumulated value after processing all elements in `arr`; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the current test case with `arr` fully processed; `residue_map` is a dictionary with keys as tuples `(num % x, num % y)` and values as the counts of how many times each residue pair was encountered. The `results` list now includes the final value of `count` from the current test case.`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
