The variable `r_x` is assigned the value `-num % x`. The values of `num`, `x`, and other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that must contain at least one more test case, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is 0, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the next test case in `test_cases` with `arr` containing at least one element, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, and `r_x` is `-num % x`.
