The code snippet updates the value of `r_y` to be the result of `num % y`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions containing at least one more test case; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` from the current test case; `count` is `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0) + residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the next test case in `test_cases` with `arr` containing at least one element; `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `current_key` incremented by 1; `r_x` is `-num % x`; `r_y` is `num % y`; `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`; `num` is the next element in `arr`.**

In natural language: The value of `r_y` has been updated to `num % y`. All other variables retain their previous values.
