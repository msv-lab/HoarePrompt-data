You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of test case descriptions. Each test case description is a tuple containing three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers (a). Here, n is the size of the array (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), x and y are Polycarp's favorite integers (1 <= x, y <= 10^9), and a is the list of integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The length of the test_cases list is t (1 <= t <= 10^4), and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        
        residue_map = {}
        
        for num in arr:
            r_x = -num % x
            r_y = num % y
            count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
            current_key = num % x, num % y
            residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1
        
        results.append(count)
        
    #State: `test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that has been fully iterated over; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` for each test case in `test_cases`; `count` is not defined outside the loop as it is local to each iteration; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the last test case processed with `arr` fully processed; `residue_map` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each pair `(num % x, num % y)` encountered in the last `arr`.
    return results
    #The program returns `results`, which is a list containing the final value of `count` for each test case in `test_cases`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of test case descriptions. Each test case description includes three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers (a). The function processes each test case to determine a count based on the values of x and y relative to the integers in the list a. It returns a list `results` containing the final count for each test case.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `results`, which is a list containing the final value of `count` for each test case in `test_cases`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
