The code snippet `count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` increments the `count` variable by the value associated with the key `(r_x, r_y)` in the `residue_map` dictionary, or by 0 if the key does not exist in the dictionary.

Given that `residue_map` is initially empty, the value for the key `(r_x, r_y)` will not be found, and thus `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` will return 0. Therefore, `count` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that must contain at least one test case, where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, arr) with 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and arr is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `residue_map` is an empty dictionary; `arr` is the list of integers from the first test case in `test_cases` and must contain at least one integer; `r_x` is `-arr[0] % x`; `r_y` is `num % y`.**
