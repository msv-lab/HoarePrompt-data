To determine the final output state after the loop executes all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables. 

The loop iterates over each `num` in the list `arr`. For each `num`, it calculates `r_x` and `r_y`, uses these to update `count` based on the `residue_map`, and then updates the `residue_map` with the current key `(num % x, num % y)`.

After all iterations are complete, `count` will hold the final value, `residue_map` will contain the counts of all residues encountered, and `arr` will be fully processed.

Given the loop's behavior, the final output state can be described as follows:

- `test_cases` remains a list of test case descriptions containing at least one more test case (if there are more test cases to process).
- `results` contains the final value of `count` from the current test case.
- `count` holds the final accumulated value after processing all elements in `arr`.
- `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the current test case, with `arr` fully processed.
- `residue_map` is a dictionary with keys as tuples `(num % x, num % y)` and values as the counts of how many times each residue pair was encountered.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions containing at least one more test case; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` from the current test case; `count` is the final accumulated value after processing all elements in `arr`; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the current test case with `arr` fully processed; `residue_map` is a dictionary with keys as tuples `(num % x, num % y)` and values as the counts of how many times each residue pair was encountered.**
