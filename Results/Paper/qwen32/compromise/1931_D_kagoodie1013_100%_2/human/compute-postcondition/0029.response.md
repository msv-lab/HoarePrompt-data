The code assigns the value of `num % y` to `r_y`. The values of `test_cases`, `results`, `count`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `residue_map` remain unchanged. The new value of `r_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that must contain at least one more test case, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is 0, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the next test case in `test_cases` with `arr` containing at least one element, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`.**
