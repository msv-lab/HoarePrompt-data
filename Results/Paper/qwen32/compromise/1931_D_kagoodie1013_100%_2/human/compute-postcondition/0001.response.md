To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. The loop will execute if there is at least one element in the `test_cases` list. Therefore, we need to ensure that `test_cases` contains at least one test case description.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **`test_cases`**: This list must contain at least one test case description. Each test case description is a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`.
2. **`n`**: This integer represents the size of the array `arr` and must be between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\).
3. **`x` and `y`**: These integers are Polycarp's favorite integers and must be between 1 and \(10^9\).
4. **`arr`**: This is a list of integers with length `n`, and each integer in the list must be between 1 and \(10^9\).

Since the loop body is omitted, we do not need to worry about the internal state of the loop or the `results` list. We only need to ensure that the loop can start executing, which means `test_cases` must have at least one valid test case description.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that must contain at least one test case, where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, arr) with 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and arr is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `results` is an empty list**.
