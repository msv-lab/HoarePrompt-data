The given Python code snippet appends the value of `count` to the `results` list. This means that the `results` list will now include the final value of `count` after it has been calculated for the current test case.

Here is the Output State:

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions containing at least one more test case; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` from the current test case; `count` is the total number of pairs `(r_x, r_y)` that have been seen before during the iteration of the loop; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the next test case in `test_cases` with `arr` fully processed; `residue_map` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each pair `(num % x, num % y)` encountered in `arr`.**

In simpler terms, the `results` list now includes the `count` value from the current test case, while all other variables remain unchanged except that `arr` has been fully processed.
