The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the list `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` was the last element processed from `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must still have elements left to process, and `num` should be the next element in `arr`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `arr` contains at least one element, so it must have more than one element for the loop to execute again. The next `num` should be the next element in `arr`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that must contain at least one more test case, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is `count + residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the next test case in `test_cases` with `arr` containing at least two elements, `residue_map` is updated with `current_key` incremented by 1, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, `num` is the next element in `arr`**
