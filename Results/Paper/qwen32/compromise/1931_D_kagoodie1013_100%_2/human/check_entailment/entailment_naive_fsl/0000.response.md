Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the given array for each test case. Here's a breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input:**
   The program reads the input in one go and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes the number of test cases and iterates through each test case to extract the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   For each test case, the program initializes a count to 0 and a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of pairs of residues `(r_x, r_y)`.

3. **Calculating Residues:**
   For each number `num` in the array, it calculates two residues:
   - `r_x = -num % x`: This is the residue when `-num` is divided by `x`.
   - `r_y = num % y`: This is the residue when `num` is divided by `y`.

4. **Counting Beautiful Pairs:**
   The program uses the `residue_map` to count the number of previous numbers that form a beautiful pair with the current number. Specifically, it checks if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` exists in the `residue_map` and adds its count to the total count.

5. **Updating Residue Map:**
   The program then updates the `residue_map` with the current number's residues `(num % x, num % y)`.

6. **Output:**
   After processing all test cases, the program outputs the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

The logic for counting beautiful pairs is correct because:
- `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` if and only if `(-a_j) % x == a_i % x`, which is equivalent to `r_x == a_i % x`.
- `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y` if and only if `a_i % y == a_j % y`, which is equivalent to `r_y == a_j % y`.

The use of the `residue_map` ensures that the program efficiently counts the number of beautiful pairs in linear time for each test case, which is crucial given the constraints.

Since the program correctly implements the logic and handles all edge cases as per the problem description, it is correct.
