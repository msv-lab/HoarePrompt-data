### Reasoning:

The program is designed to count the number of beautiful pairs in an array based on the given criteria. Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic and how it aligns with the problem statement:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the input from standard input and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the first integer to determine the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it extracts the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, a dictionary `residue_map` is initialized to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(num % x, num % y)`.
   - The program iterates through each element in the array `arr`.
     - For each element `num`, it calculates `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y`.
     - It then checks if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` exists in `residue_map` and adds the corresponding count to `count`.
     - It updates `residue_map` with the current pair `(num % x, num % y)`.

3. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**:
   - The condition `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` can be rephrased as `(a_i % x + a_j % x) % x == 0`, which simplifies to `a_i % x == -a_j % x` (or equivalently `a_j % x == -a_i % x`).
   - The condition `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y` can be rephrased as `(a_i % y - a_j % y) % y == 0`, which simplifies to `a_i % y == a_j % y`.
   - Therefore, a pair `(i, j)` is beautiful if `(a_i % x, a_i % y)` matches `(-a_j % x, a_j % y)`.
   - By maintaining a count of these pairs, the program effectively counts the number of beautiful pairs.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program outputs the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given criteria. It efficiently uses a dictionary to keep track of the necessary residues and counts, ensuring that the solution is both correct and efficient.
