### Reasoning:

The program is designed to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array `a` for each test case. According to the problem, a pair of indices \((i, j)\) is considered beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the counts of pairs of residues \((a_i \% x, a_i \% y)\). For each element `num` in the array, it calculates:
- \(r_x = -num \% x\)
- \(r_y = num \% y\)

The count of beautiful pairs is incremented by the number of times the pair \((r_x, r_y)\) has been seen before (stored in `residue_map`). Then, it updates the count of the current residue pair \((num \% x, num \% y)\) in `residue_map`.

The logic of using residues is correct because:
- For \(a_i + a_j\) to be divisible by \(x\), \((a_i \% x) + (a_j \% x) \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\), which implies \((a_j \% x) \equiv -a_i \% x \pmod{x}\).
- For \(a_i - a_j\) to be divisible by \(y\), \((a_i \% y) - (a_j \% y) \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\), which implies \((a_j \% y) \equiv a_i \% y \pmod{y}\).

Thus, the pair \((r_x, r_y)\) correctly identifies potential beautiful pairs.

The execution summary indicates that the function processes each test case correctly by maintaining the residue counts and updating them as it iterates through the array, which aligns with the described logic.
