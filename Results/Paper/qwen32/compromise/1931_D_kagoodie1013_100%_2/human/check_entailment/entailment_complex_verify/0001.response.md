### Reasoning:
Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and the provided program to ensure its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to find pairs of indices \((i, j)\) in the array such that:
1. \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \ (\text{mod} \ x)\), which implies \(a_i \equiv -a_j \ (\text{mod} \ x)\).
2. \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \ (\text{mod} \ y)\), which implies \(a_i \equiv a_j \ (\text{mod} \ y)\).

This means for a pair \((i, j)\) to be beautiful:
- \(a_i \equiv -a_j \ (\text{mod} \ x)\)
- \(a_i \equiv a_j \ (\text{mod} \ y)\)

#### Program Analysis:
The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of pairs of residues:
- `r_x` is calculated as \(-num \ (\text{mod} \ x)\).
- `r_y` is calculated as \(num \ (\text{mod} \ y)\).

For each number `num` in the array:
- It calculates `r_x` and `r_y`.
- It checks how many pairs \((r_x, r_y)\) have been seen before and adds this count to the total number of beautiful pairs.
- It then updates the `residue_map` with the current residue pair \((num \% x, num \% y)\).

The key part of the logic is:
- `r_x = -num % x`: This correctly computes the residue of \(-num\) modulo \(x\).
- `r_y = num % y`: This correctly computes the residue of \(num\) modulo \(y\).
- `count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`: This checks how many times the pair \((r_x, r_y)\) has been seen before, which corresponds to the number of valid pairs \((i, j)\) where \(a_i \equiv -a_j \ (\text{mod} \ x)\) and \(a_i \equiv a_j \ (\text{mod} \ y)\).
- `residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`: This updates the count of the current residue pair \((num \% x, num \% y)\) in the dictionary.

#### Annotation Review:
The annotations provided in the code correctly describe the state of the program at key points:
- The program correctly processes each test case independently.
- The dictionary `residue_map` keeps track of the frequency of each pair \((num \% x, num \% y)\).
- The count of beautiful pairs is correctly updated based on the residues.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs by leveraging a dictionary to efficiently count pairs of residues that satisfy the given conditions.

Final: **True**
