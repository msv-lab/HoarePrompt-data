Let's analyze the given program and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the input and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the number of test cases and iterates through each test case to extract `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes a count to 0 and a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of pairs of residues `(r_x, r_y)`.

3. **Calculating Residues:**
   - For each number `num` in the array, it calculates:
     - `r_x = -num % x`: This is the residue when `-num` is divided by `x`.
     - `r_y = num % y`: This is the residue when `num` is divided by `y`.

4. **Counting Beautiful Pairs:**
   - The program uses the `residue_map` to count the number of previous numbers that form a beautiful pair with the current number.
   - Specifically, it checks if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` exists in the `residue_map` and adds its count to the total count.

5. **Updating Residue Map:**
   - The program then updates the `residue_map` with the current number's residues `(num % x, num % y)`.

### Key Points and Corrections

- **Residue Calculation:**
  - The calculation of `r_x` is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `r_x = num % x` instead of `r_x = -num % x`. This is because we need `a_i + a_j` to be divisible by `x`, which translates to `a_i % x + a_j % x ≡ 0 (mod x)`, or equivalently, `a_i % x ≡ -a_j % x (mod x)`. However, `-a_j % x` should be adjusted to be within the range `[0, x-1]`, which is simply `a_j % x` if we consider the symmetry of residues.

- **Correct Residue Pair:**
  - The correct pair to check in `residue_map` should be `(num % x, -num % y)`. However, since `-num % y` can be negative, it should be adjusted to be within the range `[0, y-1]`, which is `(num % x, (y - num % y) % y)`.

### Corrected Code Logic

Here is the corrected logic for counting beautiful pairs:

```python
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        residue_map = {}
        for num in arr:
            r_x = num % x
            r_y = (y - num % y) % y
            count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
            current_key = (num % x, num % y)
            residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

### Conclusion

The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the residue calculations for `r_x` and `r_y` are incorrect. The program does not correctly identify the pairs that form beautiful pairs based on the given conditions.

**Final: False**
