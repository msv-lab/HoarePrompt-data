Let's carefully analyze the provided program and function summary to verify if the program correctly solves the problem as described in the problem statement.

### Problem Understanding:
The problem requires finding pairs of indices \((i, j)\) in an array \(a\) such that:
1. \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \ (\text{mod} \ x)\)
2. \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \ (\text{mod} \ y)\)

These conditions can be rephrased in terms of modular arithmetic:
1. \(a_i \equiv -a_j \ (\text{mod} \ x)\)
2. \(a_i \equiv a_j \ (\text{mod} \ y)\)

### Program Analysis:
The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of pairs of residues:
- `r_x` is the residue of \(-num\) modulo `x`.
- `r_y` is the residue of `num` modulo `y`.

For each number `num` in the array:
- It calculates `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y`.
- It checks how many pairs `(r_x, r_y)` have been seen before and adds this count to the total number of beautiful pairs.
- It then updates the `residue_map` with the current residue pair `(num % x, num % y)`.

### Function Summary Analysis:
The function summary states that the function processes a list of test cases and calculates a count based on specific residue conditions related to \(x\) and \(y\) and the elements in \(a\). The summary aligns with the program's logic, which uses residues to efficiently count the number of beautiful pairs.

### Correctness Verification:
Let's verify if the program correctly implements the logic:
1. **Residue Calculation**:
   - `r_x = -num % x` ensures that the residue of \(-num\) modulo `x` is correctly calculated.
   - `r_y = num % y` ensures that the residue of `num` modulo `y` is correctly calculated.

2. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to store counts of residue pairs `(num % x, num % y)`.
   - For each number `num`, it checks how many times the pair `(r_x, r_y)` has been seen before, which corresponds to the number of beautiful pairs ending at the current index.
   - It then updates the `residue_map` with the current residue pair `(num % x, num % y)`.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program processes each test case independently and appends the result for each test case to the `results` list.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs by using residues and a dictionary to efficiently count pairs. The function summary accurately describes the program's behavior, and the original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
