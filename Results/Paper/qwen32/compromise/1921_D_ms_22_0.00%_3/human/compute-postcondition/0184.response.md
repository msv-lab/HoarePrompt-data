The code calculates the absolute difference between the current element `i` from list `a` and the last element of list `b`, which is `b[m - 1]`. This value is stored in the variable `diff2`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element; `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is 0; `i` is the next element in the list `a`; `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`; `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`.**
