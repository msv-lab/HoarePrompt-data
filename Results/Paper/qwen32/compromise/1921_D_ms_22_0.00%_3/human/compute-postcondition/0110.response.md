The provided code snippet pushes a tuple into a heap named `max_heap`. The tuple consists of the negative of `diff1`, the value of `i`, and 0. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `i`, `diff1`, or `diff2`. It only modifies the `max_heap` by adding the new tuple.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input and must have at least one integer, `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the next element in `a`, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`.**
