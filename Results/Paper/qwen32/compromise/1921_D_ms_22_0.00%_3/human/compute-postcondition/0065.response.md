Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is an integer obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one element; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `max_heap` is a list containing tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)` for each element `i` in `a`, with one element removed; `item` is the tuple with the largest `diff` value from the original `max_heap`; if `item[2] == tp1`, then `tp1` is the original value of `tp1` plus 1, otherwise `tp1` is unchanged; `tp2` is the original value of `tp2` minus 1 if `item[2] != tp1`, otherwise `tp2` is unchanged; `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `diff`.**
