To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the given information and the state of the variables.

### Given Information:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 99\).
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `m` is an integer obtained from the split input.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one element.
- `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input.
- `max_heap` is an empty list.
- `tp1` is equal to `m` (indicating all elements of `b` have been used from the lower end).
- `tp2` is -1 (indicating all elements of `b` have been used from the upper end).
- `ans` is the sum of the minimum distances required to match each element of `a` with elements of `b`.

### Understanding the Variables:
- `a` contains integers that need to be matched with integers in `b`.
- `b` is sorted, which means it can be used to efficiently find the closest elements in `b` for each element in `a`.
- `tp1` and `tp2` are pointers indicating the usage of elements in `b`. Since `tp1` is equal to `m` and `tp2` is -1, it suggests that all elements in `b` have been considered from both ends.
- `ans` is calculated as the sum of the minimum distances to match each element in `a` with an element in `b`.

### Calculation of `ans`:
The variable `ans` is the sum of the minimum distances required to match each element of `a` with elements of `b`. Since `b` is sorted, the minimum distance for each element in `a` can be found by either:
- Using a two-pointer technique to find the closest element in `b` for each element in `a`.
- Using a heap to efficiently find the minimum distance (though `max_heap` is empty here).

However, since `tp1` and `tp2` are set to values indicating that all elements in `b` have been used, we can infer that the matching process has completed, and `ans` holds the final sum of these minimum distances.

### Conclusion:
The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the minimum distances required to match each element of `a` with elements of `b`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the minimum distances required to match each element of `a` with elements of `b`)**
