The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state specifies that `t` is greater than 0 and is then decreased by 1. The value of `t` after being decreased is not specified, but it remains greater than 0.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input.**
