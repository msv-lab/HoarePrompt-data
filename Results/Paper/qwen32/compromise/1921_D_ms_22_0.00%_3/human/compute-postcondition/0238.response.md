Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `max_heap` is not empty and contains at least one tuple of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)`, but one element has been removed; `item` is the tuple of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)` that was at the root of `max_heap` before the pop operation; `ans` has been increased by `max_diff`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans` has been increased by the `max_diff` value extracted from the tuple `item` that was at the root of `max_heap` before it was removed. All other variables remain in their initial states.
