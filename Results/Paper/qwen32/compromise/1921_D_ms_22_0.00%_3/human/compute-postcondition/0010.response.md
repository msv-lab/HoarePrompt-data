The code snippet assigns the value of `m - 1` to the variable `tp2`. None of the other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the value of `tp2` is now `m - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `max_heap` is an empty list; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is `m - 1`.**
