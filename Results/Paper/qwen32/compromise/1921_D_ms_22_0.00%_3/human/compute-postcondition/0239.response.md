Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `max_heap` is not empty and contains at least one tuple of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)`, but one element has been removed; `item` is the tuple of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)` that was at the root of `max_heap` before the pop operation; `ans` has been increased by `max_diff`; `tp1` is increased by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `tp1` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial states: `t` remains greater than 0, `n` and `m` are unchanged, `a` and `b` are unchanged lists, `max_heap` still contains tuples of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)` with one element removed, `item` is the tuple that was at the root of `max_heap` before the pop operation, and `ans` has been increased by `max_diff`.
