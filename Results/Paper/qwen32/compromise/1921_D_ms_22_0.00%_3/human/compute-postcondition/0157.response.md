Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input and must contain at least one element, `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple, `item` is the tuple with the smallest absolute difference that was popped from `max_heap`, `ans` is `ans - item[0]`.**

In this output state, `ans` has been updated by subtracting the first element of the `item` tuple from it. All other variables retain their initial state values.
