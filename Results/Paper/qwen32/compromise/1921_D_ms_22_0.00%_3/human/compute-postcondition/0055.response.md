Given the initial state and the code snippet, the variable `diff1` is calculated as the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`. The other variables remain unchanged unless further modified by subsequent code, which is not provided here.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is an integer obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one element; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `max_heap` is a list containing tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)` for each element `i` in `a`, with one element removed; `item` is the tuple with the largest `diff` value from the original `max_heap`; `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`.**
