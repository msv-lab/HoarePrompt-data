Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and must have at least one element; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is 0; `i` is the next element in the list `a` after `i_next`; `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`; `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`.**

In this output state, the variable `diff2` has been added and is equal to the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of the sorted list `b`. All other variables retain their initial values.
