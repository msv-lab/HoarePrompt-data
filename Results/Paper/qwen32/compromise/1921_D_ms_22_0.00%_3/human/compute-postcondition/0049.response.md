Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is an integer obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one element; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `max_heap` is a list containing tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)` for each element `i` in `a`, with one element removed; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `diff`; `item` is the tuple with the largest `diff` value from the original `max_heap`. Additionally, `item[2]` is not less than `tp1`, `item[2]` is not greater than `tp2`, and `item[2]` is not equal to `tp1`.**
