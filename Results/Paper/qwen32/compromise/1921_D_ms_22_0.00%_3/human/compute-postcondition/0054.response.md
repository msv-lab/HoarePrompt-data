The code snippet `item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)` removes and returns the smallest element from the `max_heap` (which is actually a min-heap due to the negative `diff` values). This element is assigned to the variable `item`.

Given the initial state, `max_heap` contains tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)`, and `item` is the tuple with the largest `diff` value from the original `max_heap`. After executing the code, `item` will be the tuple with the largest `diff` value, and it will be removed from `max_heap`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is an integer obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one element; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `max_heap` is a list containing tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)` for each element `i` in `a`, with one element removed; `item` is the tuple with the largest `diff` value from the original `max_heap`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])` and `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `tp1` is set to 1, `tp2` is `m - 1`, and `ans` is set to `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 2`, and `ans` is set to `diff2`. If `item[2]` is not less than `tp1` and not greater than `tp2`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `diff`. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, `tp1` is set to 1 and `tp2` is set to `m - 1`. Otherwise, `tp1` remains 0 and `tp2` is set to `m - 2`.**
