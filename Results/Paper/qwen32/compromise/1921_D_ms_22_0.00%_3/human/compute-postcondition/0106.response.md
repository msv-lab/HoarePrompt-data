Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input and must have at least one integer, `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`. The `max_heap` contains at least two elements: `(-diff1, i, 0)` and `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`. If `diff1` was initially greater than `diff2`, `max_heap` is `[(-diff1, i, 0), (-diff2, i, m - 1)]`. If `diff1` was initially less than or equal to `diff2`, `max_heap` is `[(-diff2, i, m - 1), (-diff1, i, 0)]`.**
