The code snippet `heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))` pushes a new tuple into the `max_heap`. This tuple contains the negative of `diff1`, the value of `i`, and the integer `0`. 

Given the initial state, the value of `max_heap` is determined by the comparison between `diff1` and `diff2`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `max_heap` initially contains `[(-diff1, i, 0)]`. If `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`, `max_heap` initially contains `[(-diff2, i, m - 1)]`.

After executing the code snippet, the `max_heap` will contain an additional tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `diff1`, `diff2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input and must have at least one integer, `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, `max_heap` contains `[(-diff2, i, m - 1), (-diff1, i, 0)]` if `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2` initially, or `[(-diff1, i, 0), (-diff1, i, 0)]` if `diff1` is greater than `diff2` initially.**
