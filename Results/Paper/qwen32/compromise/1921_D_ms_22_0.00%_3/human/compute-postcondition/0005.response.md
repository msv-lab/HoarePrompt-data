The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The initial state does not specify the values of `a`, `n`, or `m`, but it does mention that `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the split input. After the execution of the code, `a` will hold the list of integers from the input, and `n` and `m` remain unchanged unless they are redefined in the code (which they are not in this snippet).

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input.**
