The code snippet `item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)` removes and returns the smallest element from the `max_heap`. Since the heap contains tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)`, the smallest element is the one with the largest `diff` (because `diff` is negated).

After this operation, `item` will hold the tuple with the largest `diff` value, and `max_heap` will have one less element.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is an integer obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one element; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `max_heap` is a list containing tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)` for each element `i` in `a`, with one element removed; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is 0; `item` is the tuple with the largest `diff` value from the original `max_heap`.**
