To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state. However, the initial state given is just `t`, which does not provide any information about the variable `ans`.

Since there is no information about the value or definition of `ans` in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, the most precise description we can provide is that `ans` is a variable whose value is unknown based on the given information.

Output: **ans (where ans is a variable whose value is unknown based on the given information)**
