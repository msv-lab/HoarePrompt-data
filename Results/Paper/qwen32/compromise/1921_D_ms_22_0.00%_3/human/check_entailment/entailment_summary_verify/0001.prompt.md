You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of two lists of integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum possible sum of absolute differences between each element in `a` and a selected element in `b`. The function ensures that each element in `b` is used at most once across all elements in `a` to achieve this minimum sum.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the total difference \( D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| \) where \( c_i \) is an array of \( n \) integers chosen from \( m \) available integers \( b_i \) and arranged in any order.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
    - The program reads the number of test cases.
    - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( m \), the lengths of arrays \( a \) and \( b \) respectively.
    - It then reads the arrays \( a \) and \( b \).

2. **Sorting**:
    - The array \( b \) is sorted in ascending order. This helps in efficiently finding the largest and smallest elements of \( b \) to maximize the difference.

3. **Heap Initialization**:
    - A max-heap (implemented using a min-heap with negative values) is used to keep track of the maximum possible differences for each element in \( a \).
    - For each element \( i \) in \( a \), the program calculates the difference with the smallest (\( b[0] \)) and the largest (\( b[m-1] \)) elements of the sorted \( b \).
    - The larger of these two differences is pushed into the heap along with the element and the index of the chosen \( b \) element.

4. **Heap Processing**:
    - The program then processes the heap to calculate the maximum total difference.
    - It pops the largest difference from the heap and checks if the corresponding \( b \) element is still available (i.e., not already used).
    - If the \( b \) element is still available, it adds the difference to the total difference and marks the element as used.
    - If the \( b \) element is already used, it recalculates the difference with the next available smallest or largest element in \( b \) and adds the maximum of these to the total difference.

5. **Output**:
    - After processing all elements in \( a \), the program prints the total maximum difference for the current test case.

### Correctness Verification

The program effectively uses a greedy approach combined with a heap to maximize the total difference. By always choosing the maximum possible difference for each element in \( a \) and efficiently managing the available elements in \( b \) using a heap, the program ensures that the total difference is maximized.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It efficiently calculates the maximum total difference \( D \) for each test case.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
