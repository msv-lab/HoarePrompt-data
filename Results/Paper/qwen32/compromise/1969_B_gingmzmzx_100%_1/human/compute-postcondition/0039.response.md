The code snippet `ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0` increments `ans` by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise it remains unchanged. 

Given the initial state:
- `cnt` is either `[1, 1]` if the previous `c` is 0, otherwise it is `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]` with one of the elements incremented by 1.
- `ans` is 0 or 1 if the previous `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `ans + zeroes - cnt[0]`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string and has at least 1 element.
- `zeroes` is the count of 0s in `s`.
- `c` is the next element in `s`.

The value of `cnt[1]` can be 0, 1, or 2 (since it is incremented by 1 based on previous conditions). If `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, `ans` will be incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` will remain the same.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`cnt` is `[1, 1]` if the previous `c` is 0, otherwise `cnt` is `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]` with one of the elements incremented by 1; `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged; `n` is greater than 0; `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string and has at least 1 element; `zeroes` is the count of 0s in `s`; `c` is the next element in `s`.**
