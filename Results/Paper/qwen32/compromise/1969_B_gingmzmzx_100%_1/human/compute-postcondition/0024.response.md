To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the context and the logic used to calculate `ans` based on `cnt`, which is `[total number of 0s, total number of 1s]`.

Given the initial state:
- `cnt` is a list containing two elements: `[total number of 0s, total number of 1s]`.
- `ans` is the total score calculated based on some logic, which is not explicitly described in the precondition.

Since the logic to calculate `ans` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe `ans` in terms of the elements in `cnt`.

Let's assume a common logic for `ans` based on typical problems involving counts of 0s and 1s. One common logic could be that `ans` is the product of the counts of 0s and 1s, or some other function of these counts. Without specific logic, we can only describe `ans` in terms of `cnt`.

Thus, the output will be described as `ans` in terms of `cnt`.

Output: **ans (where ans is calculated based on cnt, which is [total number of 0s, total number of 1s])**
