The code snippet provided resets the `cnt` list to `[0, 0]`. This means that the previous counts of `0`s and `1`s in the list `s` are discarded and reset to zero. The other variables (`ans`, `n`, `s`, and `zeroes`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`cnt` is `[0, 0]`, `ans` is the calculated sum based on the described logic, `n` is decremented by 1, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string, `zeroes` is the count of `0` in `s`.**
