The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the value at index `c` in the list `cnt` by 1. Given that `cnt` is initially `[0, 0]`, this means that either `cnt[0]` or `cnt[1]` will be incremented by 1, depending on the value of `c`. The values of `ans`, `n`, `s`, and `zeroes` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`cnt` is `[0, 0]` with one of the elements incremented by 1, `ans` is 0, `n` is decremented by 1, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string and must have at least 1 element, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in `s`.** 

To clarify further, if `c` is 0, then `cnt` becomes `[1, 0]`. If `c` is 1, then `cnt` becomes `[0, 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
