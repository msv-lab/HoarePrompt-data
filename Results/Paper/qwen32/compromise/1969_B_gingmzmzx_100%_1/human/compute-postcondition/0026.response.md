The code snippet reads a line of input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and then maps each character in the string to an integer, creating a list of integers. This list is assigned to the variable `s`. The variables `cnt`, `ans`, and `n` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`cnt` is `[total number of 0s, total number of 1s]`, `ans` is the total score calculated based on the described logic, `n` is decremented by 1, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string.**
