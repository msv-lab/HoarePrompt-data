### Reasoning:
The problem requires us to find the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on any substring. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `r - l + 1` is `r - l + 1`.

The provided program attempts to solve this problem by iterating through each binary string and calculating the cost based on the number of '0's and '1's encountered so far. Let's break down the logic to see if it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `zeroes` is the total count of '0's in the string.
   - `cnt` is a list that keeps track of the count of '0's and '1's encountered so far.
   - `ans` is the variable that accumulates the total cost.

2. **Iteration through the string**:
   - For each character `c` in the string:
     - Increment the corresponding count in `cnt` (either `cnt[0]` or `cnt[1]`).
     - If `c` is '0' and there are any '1's encountered so far (`cnt[1] > 0`), add 1 to `ans`. This is because we need to move this '0' past all the previously seen '1's, and the cost for this operation is 1.
     - If `c` is '1', add the number of remaining '0's (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to `ans`. This is because we need to move this '1' past all the remaining '0's, and the cost for each '0' is 1.

The logic seems to be calculating the cost based on the need to move '0's past '1's and vice versa, which is a reasonable approach to determining the minimum cost to sort the string. However, the cost calculation in the code does not seem to account for the actual length of the substring being shifted, only the number of elements being moved past each other.

The provided program does not correctly calculate the cost of the cyclic shifts as described in the problem statement. The cost should be based on the length of the substring being shifted, not just the number of elements being moved past each other.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly implement the cost calculation for the cyclic shifts as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: False**
