### Reasoning:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or neither based on the conditions specified in the problem description.

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then iterates `t` times to process each test case.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It then checks the following conditions:
     - If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
     - If `a < b` and `b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
     - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NONE".
3. **Output**: The program outputs the correct result for each test case based on the given conditions.

The logic in the code matches the problem requirements, and there are no apparent issues with the implementation.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
