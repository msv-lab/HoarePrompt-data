Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are new input strings. If at index `i`, both `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, then `l` remains 'YES'. Otherwise, `l` remains 'YES'.** 

Since there is no else part, the value of `l` remains 'YES' regardless of the condition evaluation.
