To determine the output of the `print(l)` statement, we need to understand the condition that determines the value of `l`. 

The variable `l` is set to 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` (where `0 <= i < n`) such that `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is also not equal to `c[i]`. If no such index exists, `l` is set to 'NO'.

Since the exact lists `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `l`. However, we can describe the output based on the given condition.

Output: **l (where l is 'YES' if there exists at least one index i such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], otherwise 'NO')**
