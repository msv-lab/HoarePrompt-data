Output State: **`l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` (0 <= i < n) such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`; otherwise, `l` is 'NO', `i` is `x + 1`, `t` is unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the user's input, `b` is the user's input.**

Natural language: The variable `b` is now assigned the value of the user's input. The other variables (`l`, `i`, `t`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged. The condition for `l` to be 'YES' or 'NO' will be evaluated using the new value of `b`.
