The code snippet provided does not change any of the variables except for `l`, which is explicitly set to 'YES'. Since `l` is already 'YES' according to the initial state, the assignment does not alter its value. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with the exception of the `i` variable, which is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are new input strings, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `l` is 'YES'**
