To determine the output, we need to analyze the condition given for the variable `l`.

The variable `l` is set to 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` (where `0 <= i < n`) such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`. If no such index exists, `l` is set to 'NO'.

Since the exact values of the lists `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical indices that satisfy the condition. However, we can describe the value of `l` based on the given condition.

The print statement will output the value of `l`, which is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the described condition.

Output: **l (where l is 'YES' if there exists at least one index i such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], otherwise 'NO')**
