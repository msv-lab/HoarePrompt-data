The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has not been specified directly, but we can infer it must have been a value such that the loop condition was true for the previous iteration.

Since the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been some value `k` where `0 <= k < n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `k + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `k + 1`.

Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration specifies that `n` must be greater than 0, and without loss of generality, we can assume `i` was `k` (where `k < n`), the state at the start of the next iteration should have `i` incremented by 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`**.

Since `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, in the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`. Therefore, the condition for the loop to continue is that `n` must be greater than `k + 1`.

However, to generalize and not assume a specific value for `k`, we can simply state that `i` is incremented by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than `i`**.
