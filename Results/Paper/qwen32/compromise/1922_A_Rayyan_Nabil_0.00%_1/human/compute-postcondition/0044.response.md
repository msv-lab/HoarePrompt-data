Postcondition: **`l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` (0 <= i < n) such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`; otherwise, `l` remains 'NO'. `t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the user's inputs. At the current index `i`, if `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`, `l` is set to 'YES'.**
