The code snippet provided takes a new input and assigns it to the variable `c`. This means the previous value of `c` (which was a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters) is replaced by the new input string. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `c` is the new input string, `l` is 'YES'**.
