The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `n` to be the integer value of the user input. The other variables (`l`, `i`, and `t`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` (0 <= i < n) such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`; otherwise, `l` is 'NO', `i` is `x + 1`, `t` is unchanged, `n` is an input integer.**
