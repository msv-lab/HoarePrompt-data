### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - `func_2` reads two integers `n` and `x` for each test case.
   - `func_3` reads the permutation `p` for each test case.

2. **Permutation Processing:**
   - For each test case, the program creates a dictionary `num_indx` that maps each number in the permutation to its index (1-based).
   - It initializes a `seen` list to keep track of which elements have been encountered during the binary search.
   - It sets `left` to 0 and `right` to `n` (1-based indices).

3. **Binary Search:**
   - The binary search loop continues until `right - left` is 1.
   - It calculates the middle index `mid`.
   - It marks the element at `mid` as seen.
   - It adjusts `left` or `right` based on whether the element at `mid` is less than or equal to `x`.

4. **Result Determination:**
   - If the element at `left` is `x`, no swaps are needed (`print(0)`).
   - If `x` has not been seen, one swap is sufficient to bring `x` to the position where `left` ends up (`print(1)` followed by the indices to swap).
   - If `x` has been seen, two swaps are needed. The first swap moves an unseen element to the position where `left` ends up, and the second swap brings `x` to that position (`print(2)` followed by the indices to swap).

### Verification:

The program correctly handles the constraints and examples provided. It ensures that the binary search will terminate with `p[left]` equal to `x` by performing at most two swaps. The logic for determining the number of swaps and the indices to swap is sound based on the problem description.

### Conclusion:

The program meets the problem description and handles the given test cases correctly.

**Correctness: True**
