The code snippet takes an input string, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `l1`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace.**
