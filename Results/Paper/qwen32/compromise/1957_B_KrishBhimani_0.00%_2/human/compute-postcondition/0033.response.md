The code snippet appends the value of `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Let's analyze the changes:

- `ans` initially is `[0, 1]` if `c` was `n - 1` initially, otherwise `ans` is `[1]`.
- If `ans` is `[0, 1]`, then `sum(ans)` is `1`. Therefore, `k0 - sum(ans)` becomes `k0 - 1`.
- If `ans` is `[1]`, then `sum(ans)` is `1`. Therefore, `k0 - sum(ans)` becomes `k0 - 1`.

In both cases, `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` results in appending `k0 - 1` to `ans`.

Thus, the updated `ans` will be:
- If `ans` was `[0, 1]`, it becomes `[0, 1, k0 - 1]`.
- If `ans` was `[1]`, it becomes `[1, k0 - 1]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 0; `i` is the second element of `arr`; `arr` is a list containing at least one element; `ans` is `[0, 1, k0 - 1]` if `c` was `n - 1` initially, otherwise `ans` is `[1, k0 - 1]`; `c` is either `n - 1` (if the condition was met and we broke out of the loop or statement) or retains its original value (if the condition was not met) plus 1.**
