The code snippet `ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))` appends zeros to the list `ans` until its length is equal to `n`. Given that `ans` is initially `[8, 8, 4, -20]` when `n` is 3, the length of `ans` (which is 4) is already greater than `n` (which is 3). Therefore, no zeros are appended to `ans`, and `ans` remains unchanged.

The other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `i`, `arr`, and `c`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is the integer value of `k`; `i` is the last value from `arr` (which could be 2 or 3 depending on the exact number of iterations); `arr` is [2, 3]; `ans` is [8, 8, 4, -20]; `c` is `n`.**
