Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1` and `k` must be greater than 0; `k0` is equal to `k`; `i` is 0. If `k` is an odd integer, then `arr` is `[0]`. Otherwise, `arr` remains an empty list.**
