Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is a non-zero integer (greater than 0); `k0` is the integer value of `k`; `i` is 0; `arr` is [0] if `k` is odd, otherwise `arr` remains []; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros; `c` is 0.**
