The code snippet `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` appends a new value to the list `ans`. Here's the breakdown of the changes:

- `k0` is 1.
- `ans` is initially `[4, 4]`, so `sum(ans)` is `4 + 4 = 8`.
- The new value to be appended is `k0 - sum(ans)`, which is `1 - 8 = -7`.

After appending `-7` to `ans`, the updated `ans` becomes `[4, 4, -7]`.

The values of other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `arr`, `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 1; `i` is 2; `arr` is [0, 2]; `c` is `n + 1`; `ans` is [4, 4, -7]**
