In the provided task, the `while` loop condition is `while k:`. This loop will execute as long as `k` is a truthy value. In Python, any non-zero integer is considered truthy. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `k` must be greater than 0.

Let's analyze the given state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.
- `arr` is an empty list.
- `k0` is equal to `k`.
- `i` is 0.

The only variable in the loop head is `k`. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `k` must be greater than 0. The current state does not provide any constraints on the value of `k` other than it being derived from the second element of `l1`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `k` is greater than 0.

The state right before the loop, with the necessary adjustment, should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1` and `k` must be greater than 0; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `i` is 0**.
