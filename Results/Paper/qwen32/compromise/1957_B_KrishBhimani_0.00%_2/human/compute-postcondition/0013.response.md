The code snippet `arr.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `arr`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1. Therefore, `arr` will now contain the value 1. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` must be greater than 0; `k0` is equal to the original value of `k`; `i` is 1; `arr` is `[1]` if the original `k` was an odd integer, otherwise `arr` is `[1]`.**
