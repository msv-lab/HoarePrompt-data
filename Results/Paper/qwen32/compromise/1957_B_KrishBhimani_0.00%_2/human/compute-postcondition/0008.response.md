The code snippet `arr.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `arr`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `arr` will now contain the single element `[0]`. 

All other variables remain unchanged. Here's the output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1` and `k` must be greater than 0; `arr` is `[0]`; `k0` is equal to `k`; `i` is 0; `k` is an odd integer**.
