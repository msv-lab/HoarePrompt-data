To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop based on the provided information.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the elements in `arr`.
- In the loop, `c` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
- The loop appends `1 << i` to `ans` in each iteration, where `i` is the current element from `arr`.
- If `c` equals `n - 1`, the loop appends `k0 - sum(ans)` to `ans` and breaks out of the loop.

### Observations:
- From the given output states, we see that `arr` grows with each iteration.
- The elements of `arr` seem to be indices for the left shift operation (`1 << i`).
- The value of `c` increases by 1 with each iteration.
- The loop breaks when `c` reaches `n - 1`.

### Given Output States:
1. **After 1 iteration:**
   - `c` is `n`
   - `ans` is `[4]` (which is `1 << 2`)
   - `arr` is `[0]`

2. **After 2 iterations:**
   - `c` is `n + 1`
   - `ans` is `[4, 4]` (which is `1 << 2` and `1 << 2`)
   - `arr` is `[0, 2]`

3. **After 3 iterations:**
   - `c` is `n + 2`
   - `ans` is `[4, 4, 4]` unless `c == n - 1`, in which case `ans` is `[4, 4, -7, 4]` and the loop breaks.

### Final State:
- The loop will break when `c` reaches `n - 1`.
- Since `c` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the loop will run `n` times.
- The values of `ans` will be `[4, 4, ..., 4]` with `n-1` elements, unless the loop breaks before reaching `n` iterations.
- If the loop breaks when `c == n - 1`, the last element of `ans` will be `k0 - sum(ans)`.

### Conclusion:
- The loop will run `n` times if `n` is not reached before the break condition.
- The final `ans` list will contain `n-1` elements of `4` followed by the value `k0 - sum(ans)`.

### Calculation:
- `ans` initially is `[4, 4, ..., 4]` with `n-1` elements.
- `sum(ans)` will be `4 * (n - 1)`.
- The final element appended to `ans` will be `k0 - sum(ans)`, which is `1 - 4 * (n - 1)`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 1; `i` is 2; `arr` is [0, 2, ..., 2*(n-1)]; `c` is `n`; `ans` is [4, 4, ..., 4, 1 - 4*(n-1)]**

In natural language, the final output state means that the list `ans` will contain `n-1` elements, each being `4`, followed by a final element that is `1 - 4*(n-1)`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial conditions.
