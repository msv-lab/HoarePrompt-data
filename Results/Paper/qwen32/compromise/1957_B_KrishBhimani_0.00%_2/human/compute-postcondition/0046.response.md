The code `ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))` appends zeros to the list `ans` until its length equals `n`. Given that `ans` is initially an empty list, after executing this line, `ans` will be a list of `n` zeros.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 0; `i` is 0; `arr` is []; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros; `c` is 0.**
