The code snippet `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` appends a value to the list `ans`. Here's the step-by-step impact:

1. `k0` is the initial value of `k`, which is 0.
2. `sum(ans)` calculates the sum of the current elements in `ans`. Initially, `ans` is an empty list, so `sum(ans)` is 0.
3. The value being appended to `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans)`, which is `0 - 0 = 0`.

After this operation, `ans` will contain one element, which is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is the integer value of `k`; `i` is 3; `arr` is [2]; `ans` is [0]; `c` is equal to `n - 1`**.
