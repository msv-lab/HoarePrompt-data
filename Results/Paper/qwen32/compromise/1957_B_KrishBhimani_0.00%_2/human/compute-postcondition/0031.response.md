The provided code snippet appends a value to the list `ans`. The value being appended is `1 << i`, which is a bitwise left shift operation. This operation shifts the binary representation of `1` to the left by `i` places, effectively calculating `2^i`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
- `k` is 0.
- `k0` is 0.
- `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`, which is 0 since `k0` is 0.
- `arr` is a list containing at least one element.
- `ans` is `[0]` if `c` is equal to `n - 1`, otherwise `ans` remains an empty list.
- `c` is either `n - 1` (if the condition was met and we broke out of the loop or statement) or retains its original value (if the condition was not met) plus 1.

The value of `i` is 0, so `1 << i` is `1 << 0`, which equals `1`.

Thus, the list `ans` will have `1` appended to it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 0; `i` is 0; `arr` is a list containing at least one element; `ans` is `[0, 1]` if `c` was `n - 1` initially, otherwise `ans` is `[1]`; `c` is either `n - 1` (if the condition was met and we broke out of the loop or statement) or retains its original value (if the condition was not met) plus 1.**
