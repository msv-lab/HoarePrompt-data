The value of `i` is 2, and it is appended to the list `arr`. The initial state of `arr` is either `[1]` if `k` is odd or `[]` if `k` is even. After appending `i`, `arr` will be either `[1, 2]` or `[2]` depending on the initial value of `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` must be at least 1; `i` is 2; `arr` is either `[1, 2]` if `k` is odd or `[2]` if `k` is even; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros; `c` is 0**
