Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 1; `i` is 2; `arr` is [0, 2]; `c` is `n + 1`; `ans` is [4, 4, -7] and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
