Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is the integer value of `k`; `i` is 2; `arr` is [2, 3]; `c` is `n + 1`; If `c` equals `n - 1`, then `ans` is either [8, 8, -16] or [0, 8, 8, -16] and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains either [8, 8] or [0, 8, 8].**
