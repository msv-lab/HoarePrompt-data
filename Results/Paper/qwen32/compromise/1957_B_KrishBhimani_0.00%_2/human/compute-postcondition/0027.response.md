The code snippet `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` appends the value of `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` is an empty list, so `sum(ans)` is 0. Therefore, the value appended to `ans` is `k0 - 0`, which is simply `k0`.

Given that `k0` is equal to the original value of `k` and `k` is initialized to 0, `k0` is 0. Thus, the value appended to `ans` is 0.

After this operation, `ans` will contain one element, which is 0. The other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `i`, `arr`, and `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 0; `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`; `arr` is a list containing at least one element; `ans` is [0]; `c` is equal to `n - 1`**
