The code snippet `ans.append(1 << i)` appends the result of the bitwise left shift operation `1 << i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 3, `1 << 3` is equivalent to 8. Therefore, the list `ans` will have 8 appended to it.

The other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `arr`, and `c`) remain unchanged by the execution of this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is the integer value of `k`; `i` is 3; `arr` is [2]; `ans` is either [8] or [0, 8]; `c` is `n`.**
