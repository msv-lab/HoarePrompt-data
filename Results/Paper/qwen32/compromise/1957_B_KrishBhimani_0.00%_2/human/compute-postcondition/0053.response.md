The code snippet `i = 0` sets the variable `i` to 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`; `k0` is the integer value of `k`; `i` is 0; `arr` is []; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros; `c` is 0**.
