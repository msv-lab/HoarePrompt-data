The code snippet `ans.append(1 << i)` appends the result of `1 << i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 2, `1 << 2` is equivalent to `1 * 2^2`, which is 4. Therefore, the value 4 is appended to the list `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 1; `i` is 2; `arr` is [0, 2]; `c` is `n + 1`; `ans` is [4, 4]**
