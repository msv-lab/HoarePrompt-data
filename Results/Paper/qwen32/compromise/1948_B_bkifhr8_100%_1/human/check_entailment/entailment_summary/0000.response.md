Reasoning:
The provided program aims to determine if an array can be transformed into a non-decreasing order by applying the specified operation. However, the logic in the program is flawed. The program checks from the end of the array towards the beginning, and if it finds an element that is smaller than the previous one, it attempts to split the previous element and check if the resulting array is sorted. This approach does not correctly simulate the operation described in the problem statement and does not check all possible transformations.

The problem statement allows us to split any element that is at least 10 into its digits and insert them in the same position, and this operation can be applied any number of times. The program does not correctly implement this logic. Instead, it only considers splitting the element just before the smaller element and checks if that results in a sorted array, which is insufficient.

For example, consider the test case:
```
3
12 28 5
```
The program would check if 5 < 28 and attempt to split 28 into [2, 8, 5] and check if it's sorted, which it is not. However, the correct approach would be to split 28 into [2, 8] and then check if the array [12, 2, 8, 5] can be sorted by further operations, which it can by splitting 12 into [1, 2].

The program does not account for the possibility of multiple splits and rearrangements needed to sort the array, and thus it may incorrectly conclude that a sortable array is not sortable.

Correctness: **False**
