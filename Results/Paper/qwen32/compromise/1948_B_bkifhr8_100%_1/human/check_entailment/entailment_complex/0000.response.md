Reasoning:  
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order using the described operation. Specifically, the program attempts to check if the array can be rearranged by splitting numbers and comparing them, but it does not correctly handle the transformation process.

Here are the main issues:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting and Comparing**:
   - The program checks if splitting the previous number and adding the current number results in a sorted list. This is not sufficient to determine if the entire array can be sorted.
   - The program does not actually split the numbers and reinsert them into the array. It only checks a temporary list created for comparison and does not update the array accordingly.

2. **Incorrect Loop and Conditions**:
   - The loop iterates from the end of the array to the beginning, which is not the most intuitive way to handle the problem. It's more natural to iterate from the beginning to the end and handle the splitting and insertion correctly.
   - The condition `if nums != sorted(nums)` is not sufficient because it only checks if the temporary list is sorted, not if the entire array can be sorted after performing the operation.

3. **Lack of Proper Transformation**:
   - The program does not properly transform the array by splitting numbers and reinserting digits. It only checks a temporary list and does not update the array.

4. **Output Logic**:
   - The output logic is based on the incorrect assumption that the temporary list being sorted implies the entire array can be sorted. This is not the case.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Iterate through the array and check if any number is greater than the next number.
- If a number is greater than the next number, split the number and reinsert its digits into the array.
- Check if the entire array is sorted after performing the necessary splits.
- Repeat this process until no more splits are needed or the array is sorted.

Given these issues, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
