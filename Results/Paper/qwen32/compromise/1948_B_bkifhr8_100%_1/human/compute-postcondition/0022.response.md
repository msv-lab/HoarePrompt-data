The code snippet takes the integer at the index `i - 1` in the list `arr`, converts it to a string, and then creates a list of its digits. It then appends the integer at the index `i` in the list `arr` to this new list. 

Given that `i` is `m - 3`, the integer at index `i - 1` is `arr[m - 4]` and the integer at index `i` is `arr[m - 3]`.

Let's denote `arr[m - 4]` as `x` and `arr[m - 3]` as `y`. The list `nums` will be created as `[int(digit) for digit in str(x)] + [y]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an integer and is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `m - 3`, `nums` is a list created by converting the integer `arr[m - 4]` to its digits and appending `arr[m - 3]` to this list.**
