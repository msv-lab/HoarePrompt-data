The code snippet provided resets the variable `ans` to `True`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `arr`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and is now `n-1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is the integer read from the input, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 1, and `ans` is True.**
