The code snippet `m = int(input())` assigns a new value to the variable `m` by reading an integer from the input. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and is now `n-1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is the integer read from the input, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 1, and `ans` is True unless a condition within the loop set it to False.**
