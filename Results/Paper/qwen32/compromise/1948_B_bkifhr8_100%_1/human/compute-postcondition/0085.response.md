Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and is now `n-1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]` and the rest of the elements remain unchanged, `i` is `m-2`, `nums` is a list where the first part is the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`, and `ans` remains True unless it was set to False due to `nums` not being sorted. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, `ans` is set to False. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.**
