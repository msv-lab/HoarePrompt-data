Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 2. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, `arr[1]` is updated to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[1]` and the last element is `arr[2]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `nums` is sorted, no changes are made to `ans` or the loop. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, no changes are made to `arr`, `nums`, `ans`, or the loop.**
