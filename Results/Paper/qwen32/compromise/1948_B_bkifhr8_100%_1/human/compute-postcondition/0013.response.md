Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an integer and is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, `arr[i - 1]` is set to `nums[0]` (the first digit of `arr[i - 1]`), `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and if `nums` is not equal to the sorted version of `nums`, then `ans` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `ans` remains True. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, `ans` remains unchanged.**
