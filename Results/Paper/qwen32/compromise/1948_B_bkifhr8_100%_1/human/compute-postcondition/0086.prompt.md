Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and is now `n-1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is the integer read from the input, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 1, and `ans` is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and is now `n-1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input with `arr[0]` updated to `nums[0]`, `i` is 1, and `ans` is False if `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains True. `nums` is a list that contains the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and is now `n-1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input with `arr[0]` updated to `nums[0]`, `i` is 1, and `ans` is False if `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains True. `nums` is a list that contains the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, `ans` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the state of `ans` and the loop remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and is now `n-1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]` and the rest of the elements remain unchanged, `i` is `m-2`, `nums` is a list where the first part is the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`, and `ans` remains True unless it was set to False due to `nums` not being sorted. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, `ans` is set to False. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
