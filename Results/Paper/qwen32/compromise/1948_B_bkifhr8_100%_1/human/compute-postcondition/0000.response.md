The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The value of `t` and the list `a` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the value of `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, and `a` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99. The only change is that `n` now holds the value of the integer input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the input integer, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99.**
