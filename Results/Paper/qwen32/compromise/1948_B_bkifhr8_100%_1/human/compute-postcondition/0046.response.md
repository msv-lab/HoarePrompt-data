Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 2, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[1]` and the last element is `arr[2]`, `ans` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `arr`, `i`, `nums`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
