The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `arr`. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `m` remain unchanged. The new list `arr` will contain the integers from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
