You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: the program will have printed 'NO' or 'YES' followed by a string of '110's for each input `n` depending on whether `n` is odd or even and if the constructed string's length is less than 200. The value of `t` remains unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not generate a string of uppercase Latin letters as required by the problem description. Instead, it generates a string consisting of the digits '1' and '0'. Additionally, the program incorrectly determines the feasibility of constructing such a string based on whether `n` is even, which is not the correct condition.

The problem requires that there be exactly `n` special characters in the string, where a special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The program should generate a string of uppercase Latin letters that satisfies this condition.

For example, for `n = 1`, the program incorrectly outputs "NO", but the correct output would be "YES" followed by a string like "AA" or "BB", where the middle character is special.

For `n = 2`, the program also incorrectly outputs "NO", but a correct output would be "YES" followed by a string like "AAB" or "BBA", where the middle two characters are special.

Here is a correct approach to solve the problem:

1. If `n` is 1, the output should be "YES" followed by a string like "AA" or "BB".
2. If `n` is greater than 1, the output should be "YES" followed by a string where there are `n` special characters. One way to achieve this is to create a pattern where each special character is a part of a pair of the same character, except for one character that is part of a triplet. For example, for `n = 6`, the string "AAABAACC" works because there are 6 special characters at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('YES')
            print('AA')
        elif n == 2:
            print('YES')
            print('AAB')
        else:
            s = 'AA' * (n - 1) + 'AAA'
            print('YES')
            print(s)

func()
```

This corrected program generates strings of uppercase Latin letters and correctly handles the cases where `n` is 1 or greater than 1.
