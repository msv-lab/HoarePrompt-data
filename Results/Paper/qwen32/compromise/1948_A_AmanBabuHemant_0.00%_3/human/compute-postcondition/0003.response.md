Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n`. The function returns a result for each test case based on the value of `n`. For each test case, if `n` is within the range 1 to 50, the function performs an unspecified operation and returns a result. The exact result depends on the operation defined within the function for each `n`.**
