You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    2 1 7
    
    2 1 1
    
    2 3 15
    
    3 3 6
    
    4 4 5
    
    5 4 7
    
    4 88 1000000000
    
    25 69 231
    
    13 97 18806

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program is designed to determine whether Sasha can achieve any number of coins given the rules of the casino. Here is the provided code:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 1
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')
```

### Understanding the Logic

1. **Initialization**: `s` is initialized to 1. This variable represents the minimum amount of coins Sasha needs to guarantee that he can achieve any number of coins.
2. **Loop for Consecutive Losses**: The loop runs `x` times, where `x` is the maximum number of consecutive losses allowed.
   - In each iteration, `s` is updated using the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`.
   - The formula `s // (k - 1) + 1` seems to be an attempt to calculate the minimum amount of coins Sasha needs to recover from consecutive losses.
3. **Comparison**: After the loop, the program checks if Sasha's initial amount of coins `a` is greater than or equal to `s`. If it is, Sasha can achieve any number of coins, and the program prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Potential Issues

1. **Formula Validity**: The formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` might not correctly calculate the minimum amount of coins Sasha needs to recover from consecutive losses.
   - For example, if `k = 2` and `x = 1`, the formula becomes `s += s // 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `s += s + 1`. This does not seem to correctly represent the logic needed to determine the minimum required coins.
2. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases, especially when `k` and `x` are at their maximum values.

### Testing the Program

Let's test the program with some examples to see if it behaves as expected.

#### Test Case 9
```
Input:
1
13 97 18806

Expected Output:
NO
```
The program outputs "No", which is correct.

### Conclusion

Based on the test cases provided, the program seems to work correctly for the given examples. However, the formula used in the loop might not be correct for all possible values of `k` and `x`. Let's consider a more complex example to verify this.

#### Complex Test Case
```
Input:
1
3 2 10

Expected Output:
YES
```
Explanation:
- If `k = 3` and `x = 2`, Sasha can place bets as follows:
  - First bet: 1 coin. If he wins, he has 3 coins. If he loses, he has 0 coins.
  - Second bet: 1 coin (if he won the first bet) or 2 coins (if he lost the first bet).
  - If he loses the second bet, he will have 0 coins if he lost the first bet, or 1 coin if he won the first bet.
- To recover from two consecutive losses, Sasha needs at least 4 coins (1 + 1 + 2).

The formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` does not correctly calculate this.

### Final Conclusion

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases, especially when `k` and `x` are at their maximum values. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
