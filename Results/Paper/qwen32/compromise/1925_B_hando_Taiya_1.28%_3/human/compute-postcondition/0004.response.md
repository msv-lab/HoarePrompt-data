To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand how the variable `ans` is defined.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\).
- `ans` is defined as the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or the largest `x // i` that is less than or equal to `n`.

### Understanding `ans`:
1. **Largest Divisor of `x` that is \(\leq n\)**:
   - This means finding the largest integer `d` such that `d` divides `x` (i.e., `x % d == 0`) and `d` is less than or equal to `n`.

2. **Largest `x // i` that is \(\leq n\)**:
   - This means finding the largest integer `k` such that `x // i` (integer division of `x` by `i`) is less than or equal to `n`. This implies `i` must be at least `x // n`.

Since `ans` is defined as the largest of these two possibilities, we need to consider both cases and determine which one yields the larger value.

### Determining the Output:
Given the initial state, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans` without specific values for `x` and `n`. However, we can describe the value of `ans` precisely based on the given conditions.

- **If the largest divisor of `x` that is \(\leq n\) is larger than the largest `x // i` that is \(\leq n\)**, then `ans` will be the largest divisor.
- **If the largest `x // i` that is \(\leq n\) is larger than or equal to the largest divisor of `x` that is \(\leq n\)**, then `ans` will be the largest `x // i`.

### Conclusion:
Based on the precondition provided, the output of the `print(ans)` statement will be the largest value between the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` and the largest `x // i` that is less than or equal to `n`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the largest value between the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to n and the largest x // i that is less than or equal to n)**
