Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each of the following `t` lines, it receives a binary string `s` (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5; s_i ∈ {0, 1}). The function sorts each binary string `s` and returns the sorted version of each string.**
