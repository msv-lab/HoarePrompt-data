The code snippet `s = list(map(int, input().strip()))` takes an input string, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and then maps each character in the string to an integer, effectively converting the input string into a list of integers. This means that the list `s` is reassigned to a new list of integers based on the input provided.

Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `n`, `zeroes`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged because the code snippet only modifies `s`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is assigned the value of `t - 1`, `s` is a list of integers based on the input, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in the original `s`, `cnt` is `[total number of 0s in the original s, total number of 1s in the original s]`, and `ans` is the sum of `1` for each `0` encountered after at least one `1` and `zeroes - cnt[0]` for each `1` encountered.**
