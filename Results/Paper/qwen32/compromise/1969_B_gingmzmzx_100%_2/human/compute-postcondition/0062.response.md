The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the count at the index specified by the value of `c` in the list `cnt`.

Given the initial state:
- `cnt` is `[1, 0]` if the previous `c` was 0, otherwise `cnt` is `[0, 1]`.
- `ans` is `0` if the previous `c` was 0, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`.
- `n` is greater than the number of iterations that have already occurred.
- `s` is a list of integers derived from the input and has at least one element.
- `zeroes` is the count of `0`s in the list `s`.
- `c` is the next element in the list `s`.

After executing `cnt[c] += 1`:
- If `c` is 0, `cnt[0]` is incremented by 1.
- If `c` is 1, `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1.

The values of `ans`, `n`, `s`, and `zeroes` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`cnt` is `[2, 0]` if the previous `c` was 0 and the current `c` is 0, `cnt` is `[1, 1]` if the previous `c` was 0 and the current `c` is 1, `cnt` is `[0, 2]` if the previous `c` was 1 and the current `c` is 1, `cnt` is `[1, 1]` if the previous `c` was 1 and the current `c` is 0; `ans` is `0` if the previous `c` was 0, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`; `n` is greater than the number of iterations that have already occurred; `s` is a list of integers derived from the input and has at least one element; `zeroes` is the count of `0`s in the list `s`; `c` is the next element in the list `s`.**
