Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is `t - 1`, `s` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is updated such that if `c` is 0, `cnt[0]` is incremented by 1, otherwise `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1. If `c` is 0 and `cnt[1] > 0`, `ans` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]`. `c` is the next element in the list `s`.**
