The code snippet `cnt = [0, 0]` resets the `cnt` list to `[0, 0]`, which means both the count of `0`s and `1`s are set to `0`. This change affects the `cnt` variable, but other variables like `t`, `n`, `s`, `zeroes`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is assigned the value of `t - 1`, `s` is a list of integers based on the input, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is `[0, 0]`, and `ans` is the sum of `1` for each `0` encountered after at least one `1` and `zeroes - cnt[0]` for each `1` encountered.**
