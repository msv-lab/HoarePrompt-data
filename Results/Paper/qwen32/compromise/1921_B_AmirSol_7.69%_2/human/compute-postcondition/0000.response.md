The code snippet provided initializes a variable `counter` to 0. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer within a specific range and that `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. The value of `n` and the contents of `s1` and `s2` remain unchanged as the only operation performed is the initialization of `counter`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of only '0' and '1', `counter` is 0.**
