The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `ans`. This operation does not affect the values of `a`, `counter`, or `cnt`. Therefore, the state of `a` remains a list with duplicate elements removed and sorted in descending order. The state of `counter` remains a `Counter` object that holds the frequency of each element in the original modified array `a` before duplicates were removed. The state of `cnt` remains `n - len(a)`.

Output State: **`a` is now a list with duplicate elements removed and sorted in descending order; `counter` is a `Counter` object that holds the frequency of each element in the original modified array `a` before duplicates were removed; `cnt` is `n - len(a)`; `ans` is an empty list.**
