`cnt` is decremented by the value of `adv`. The values of `a`, `counter`, `ans`, `i`, and `adv` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is unchanged, `counter` is unchanged, `cnt` is `cnt - adv`, `ans` contains `[a[i - 1] - 1, a[i - 1] - 2, ..., a[i - 1] - adv]`, `i` is unchanged, `adv` is unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is unchanged, `counter` is unchanged, `cnt` is `cnt - adv`, `ans` contains `[a[i - 1] - 1, a[i - 1] - 2, ..., a[i - 1] - adv]`, `i` is unchanged, `adv` is unchanged.**
