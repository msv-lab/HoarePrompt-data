Output State: **`a` is a list with at least two elements such that `a[i - 1] > a[i] + 1`, `counter` is a `Counter` object with `counter[a[i - 1]] > 0`, `cnt` is `n - len(a) - adv` where `n > len(a)`, `ans` is a list with elements `a[i - 1] - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 2`, ..., `a[i - 1] - adv` appended, `i` is a valid index such that `0 < i < len(a)`, `adv` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The value of `cnt` has been decremented by `adv`. The other variables (`a`, `counter`, `ans`, `i`, and `adv`) remain unchanged.
