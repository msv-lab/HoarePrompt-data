The code snippet `ans.append(a[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `a` to the list `ans`. 

Given the initial state, `ans` is initially an empty list or contains specific values depending on the value of `i`. After appending `a[i]` to `ans`, the list `ans` will now include this new element.

The values of `a`, `counter`, `cnt`, `i`, and `adv` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list with at least one element, `counter` is a `Counter` object, `cnt` is `n - len(a)` where `n` is at least the length of `a`, `ans` is an empty list if `i` is not greater than 0 and now contains `a[i]` if `i` is greater than 0, or if `i` is greater than 0, `a` is unchanged, `counter` has its element at index `a[i - 1]` decremented by `adv`, `cnt` is `cnt - adv`, and `ans` contains `[a[i - 1] - 1, a[i - 1] - 2, ..., a[i - 1] - adv, a[i]]`. `i` and `adv` remain unchanged.**
