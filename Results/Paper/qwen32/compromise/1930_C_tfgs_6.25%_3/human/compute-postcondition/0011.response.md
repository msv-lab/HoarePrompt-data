Output State: **Each element `a[i]` in the array `a` is incremented by `i + 1` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`; `a` is now a list with duplicate elements removed and sorted in descending order; `counter` is a `Counter` object that holds the frequency of each element in the original modified array `a` before duplicates were removed.**

Natural language: The list `a` has been sorted in descending order while maintaining the property that each element was incremented by its index plus one before duplicates were removed. The `counter` object still holds the frequency of each element in the original modified array `a` before duplicates were removed.
