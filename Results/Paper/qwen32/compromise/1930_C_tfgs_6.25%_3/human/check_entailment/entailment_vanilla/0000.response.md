Let's analyze the provided program to see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
- We have an array `a` of length `n` and an empty set `S`.
- We perform `n` operations where we choose an index `i` in `a`, insert `a[i] + i` into `S`, and then delete `a[i]` from `a`.
- The goal is to construct the lexicographically largest array `b` from the set `S` after all operations, sorted in decreasing order.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array `a` and the elements of `a`.

2. **Modification of Array `a`:**
   - The program modifies array `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element `a[i]` (where `i` is the index starting from 0 in the program, but the problem statement uses 1-based indexing).

3. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - The program uses `Counter` to count occurrences of each modified element in `a`.
   - It converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and then sorts it in descending order.

4. **Constructing the Result:**
   - The program constructs the result array `ans` by iterating over the sorted unique elements.
   - For each element, it checks how many duplicates of the previous element can be inserted before the current element to maximize the lexicographical order.
   - It appends the current element to `ans` and decreases the count of that element in the `Counter`.
   - If there are remaining duplicates, it appends the largest possible values between consecutive elements in `ans` to maximize the lexicographical order.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed array `ans` for each test case.

### Correctness Check:
- The program correctly modifies each element of `a` by adding `i + 1` to it.
- It handles duplicates by using a `Counter` and ensures that the final array `b` is sorted in decreasing order.
- The strategy of inserting the largest possible values between consecutive elements in `ans` is correct to maximize the lexicographical order.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correctly solving the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and constraints provided in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
