Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and constructs a permutation of the first `n` natural numbers. It then reverses the elements at even indices (considering 0-based indexing) while keeping the elements at odd indices unchanged. The modified permutation is printed for each test case.**
