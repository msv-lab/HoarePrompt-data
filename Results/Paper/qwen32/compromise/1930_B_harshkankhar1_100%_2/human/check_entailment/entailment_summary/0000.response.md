### Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing a permutation of numbers from 1 to n such that there do not exist two distinct indices i and j (with 1 ≤ i, j < n, i ≠ j) for which p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}. 

The provided program constructs a permutation by reversing the elements at even indices while keeping the elements at odd indices unchanged. Let's analyze whether this approach satisfies the problem's requirements.

1. **Understanding the Permutation Construction:**
    - The program generates a list of numbers from 1 to n.
    - It then reverses the elements at even indices (0-based indexing). For example, if n = 4, the list [1, 2, 3, 4] becomes [4, 2, 1, 3].

2. **Checking the Condition:**
    - For any two distinct indices i and j, we need to ensure that it is not the case that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.
    - Let's consider the structure of the modified list:
        - Elements at even indices are in decreasing order.
        - Elements at odd indices remain in their original increasing order.
    - This arrangement ensures that no element at an even index can divide any subsequent element at an even index (since they are in decreasing order).
    - Similarly, no element at an odd index can divide any subsequent element at an odd index (since they are in increasing order).
    - The only remaining possibility is that an element at an even index divides an element at an odd index, and vice versa. However, this is not a problem because the condition requires both p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}, which is not possible due to the alternating nature of the increasing and decreasing sequences.

3. **Example:**
    - For n = 4, the list [1, 2, 3, 4] becomes [4, 2, 1, 3].
    - Checking pairs:
        - (4, 2) does not divide (2, 1)
        - (4, 2) does not divide (2, 3)
        - (2, 1) does not divide (1, 3)
        - No other pairs need to be checked as they do not meet the condition of being consecutive in the permutation.

### Conclusion:
The provided program constructs a permutation that meets the problem's requirements. The alternating pattern of decreasing and increasing sequences ensures that no two pairs of elements violate the given condition.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
