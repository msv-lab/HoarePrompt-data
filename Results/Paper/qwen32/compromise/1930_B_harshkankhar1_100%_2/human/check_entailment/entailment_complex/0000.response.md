### Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing a permutation of the first `n` natural numbers such that there do not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` (with `1 ≤ i, j < n` and `i ≠ j`) such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.

The provided program constructs a permutation by reversing the elements at even indices (considering 0-based indexing) while keeping the elements at odd indices unchanged. Let's analyze whether this approach can satisfy the problem's conditions:

1. **Even and Odd Index Splitting**:
   - The program splits the list into two parts: elements at even indices and elements at odd indices.
   - It reverses the elements at even indices.

2. **Example Analysis**:
   - For `n = 4`, the initial permutation is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - After reversing the elements at even indices (0 and 2), we get `[3, 2, 1, 4]`.
   - For `n = 3`, the initial permutation is `[1, 2, 3]`.
   - Since there are no even indices to reverse, the permutation remains `[1, 2, 3]`.

3. **Checking the Conditions**:
   - For `n = 4` and permutation `[3, 2, 1, 4]`:
     - Check pairs `(i, j)`:
       - `(1, 2)`: `p_1 = 3`, `p_2 = 2`, `p_3 = 1`, `p_4 = 4`
         - `3` does not divide `1` and `2` does not divide `4`.
       - `(1, 3)`: `p_1 = 3`, `p_2 = 2`, `p_3 = 1`, `p_4 = 4`
         - `3` does not divide `1` and `2` does not divide `4`.
       - `(2, 3)`: `p_1 = 3`, `p_2 = 2`, `p_3 = 1`, `p_4 = 4`
         - `2` does not divide `1` and `4` does not divide `4`.
     - No pairs `(i, j)` exist that violate the condition.
   - For `n = 3` and permutation `[1, 2, 3]`:
     - Check pairs `(i, j)`:
       - There are no valid pairs `(i, j)` since `n < 4`.
     - The permutation satisfies the condition trivially.

4. **General Case**:
   - The provided approach ensures that the elements at even indices are reversed, which breaks any potential divisibility chain that could be formed by the original sequence.
   - The elements at odd indices remain in their original order, which also helps in breaking any potential divisibility chain.
   - This strategy is effective in preventing any two pairs `(i, j)` from violating the condition.

### Conclusion:
The provided program constructs a permutation that satisfies the problem's conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
