Postcondition: **`x` is greater than 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the result of `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the original list `l`, `i` is `i + 2`, and `l` is a list containing `ans` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `l` remains a list containing only `ans`.**
