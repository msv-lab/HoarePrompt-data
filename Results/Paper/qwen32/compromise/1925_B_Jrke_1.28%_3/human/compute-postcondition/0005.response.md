The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of variables outside of the loop or within the loop if the loop has not started yet. Since the code snippet provided does not contain any loop and the `continue` statement is not within a loop, it effectively does nothing in this context. Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `k`) are affected by this statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= x <= 10^8; `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, and the current value of `k` is 1.**
