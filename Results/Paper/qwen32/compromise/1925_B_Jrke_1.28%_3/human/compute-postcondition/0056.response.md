The only variables in the loop head are `i`, which is the loop variable, and the range it iterates over, which is determined by `x`. The loop iterates from `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0)` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` with a step of `2`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is greater than 1.
- `n` is the second integer from the input.
- `k` is the result of `x // n`.
- `ans` is updated based on the conditions involving `i` and `x // i`.
- `l` is defined if `x % i == 0`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
- The loop variable `i` needs to be incremented by the step value, which is `2`.
- The range of the loop is determined by `x`, which remains unchanged.

Let's break it down:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has some value that satisfied the loop condition.
- For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by `2` to get the next odd number (since the step is `2`).
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is incremented by `2` from its previous value.
- All other variables (`x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`x` is greater than 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the result of `x // n`, `ans` is updated based on the conditions involving `i` and `x // i`, `i` is incremented by 2, and `l` is defined if `x % i == 0`.**
