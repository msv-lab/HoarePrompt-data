Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 4 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`. If `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`), then `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` where `l` is `[1, i, x // i]` if `x // i <= k` else `l` is `[1]`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, `ans` remains 1.**
