To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to understand the initial state provided. However, the initial state in the given task does not specify any details about the variable `ans`. This means that `ans` could be any value, and without additional information, we cannot determine its exact value.

Given the lack of specific details about `ans`, we can only describe the output in terms of `ans` itself.

Output: **ans (where ans is the value of the variable ans)**
