The code snippet provided appends the result of the integer division of `x` by `i` to the list `l`. The values of `t`, `x`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is not explicitly modified in the provided code snippet, so its value remains the same as before the execution of this line.

Given the initial state, the only change is that the list `l` now includes an additional element, which is the result of `x // i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 4 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and the new value `x // i`. If `i` <= `k`, then `i` is increased by 2 and the new value of `i` is added to the list `l`. Otherwise, `i` remains unchanged.**
