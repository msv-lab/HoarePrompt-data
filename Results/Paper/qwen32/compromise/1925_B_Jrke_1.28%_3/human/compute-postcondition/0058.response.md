The code snippet provided is `l.append(i)`, which means that the value of `i` is added to the list `l`. 

Given the initial state, we know that `x` is greater than 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the result of `x // n`, `ans` is updated based on some conditions involving `i` and `x // i`, `i` is incremented by 2, and `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`. The only change made by the code snippet is that `i` is appended to the list `l`.

Output State: **`x` is greater than 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the result of `x // n`, `ans` is updated based on conditions involving `i` and `x // i`, `i` is incremented by 2, and `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` followed by the value of `i`.**
