The code appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. The values of `t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, and the initial value of `ans` remain unchanged. The only change is that `l` now contains its initial value of `ans` plus the new value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 4 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `i` is `i + 4`. If `x % i == 0`, `l` is a list containing the initial value of `ans`. Otherwise, there is no change to `l` or `ans`. `l` is a list containing the initial value of `ans` and the new value of `i`.**
