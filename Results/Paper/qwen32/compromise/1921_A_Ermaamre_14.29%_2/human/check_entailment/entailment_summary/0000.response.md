### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to determine the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners. The key to solving this problem is to identify the side length of the square, which can be determined by calculating the absolute difference between the appropriate x or y coordinates of the corners.

The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners and then checks for the pairs of coordinates that share the same x or y values. This helps in identifying the side length of the square.

The logic within the program is as follows:
1. The program checks if `x1` and `x3` are the same and `x2` and `x4` are the same. If true, it calculates the side length as the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3` (or `y3` and `y1`).
2. If the first condition is not met, it checks if `x1` and `x2` are the same and `x3` and `x4` are the same. If true, it calculates the side length as the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` (or `y2` and `y1`).
3. If the first two conditions are not met, it checks if `x1` and `x4` are the same and `x3` and `x2` are the same. If true, it calculates the side length as the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` (or `y2` and `y1`).

After determining the side length, the program calculates the area by squaring the side length and then prints the area.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

**Input:**
```
3
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2
-1 1
1 -1
1 1
-1 -1
45 11
45 39
17 11
17 39
```

**Output:**
```
9
4
784
```

- **First Test Case:**
  - Coordinates: (1, 2), (4, 5), (1, 5), (4, 2)
  - Side length = abs(5 - 2) = 3
  - Area = 3 * 3 = 9

- **Second Test Case:**
  - Coordinates: (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), (-1, -1)
  - Side length = abs(1 - (-1)) = 2
  - Area = 2 * 2 = 4

- **Third Test Case:**
  - Coordinates: (45, 11), (45, 39), (17, 11), (17, 39)
  - Side length = abs(39 - 11) = 28
  - Area = 28 * 28 = 784

The program correctly calculates and prints the area for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. It handles multiple test cases and provides the correct output based on the input.

**Correctness: True**
