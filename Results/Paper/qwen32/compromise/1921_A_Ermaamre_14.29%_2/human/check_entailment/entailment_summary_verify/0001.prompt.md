You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. For each test case, it calculates and prints the area of the square.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem.

The problem states that we need to find the area of a square given its four corners. The corners will have coordinates such that the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes. This means that two of the corners will have the same x-coordinate, and two other corners will have the same x-coordinate (and similarly for the y-coordinates).

The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners. The program then checks which pairs of x-coordinates are the same and calculates the side length of the square using the difference in the y-coordinates of the corresponding corners. The area of the square is then calculated as the square of the side length.

Let's break down the logic in the program:
- The program considers three possible scenarios for the x-coordinates of the corners:
  1. `x1 == x3 and x2 == x4`
  2. `x1 == x2 and x3 == x4`
  3. `x1 == x4 and x3 == x2`
- For each scenario, it calculates the side length of the square using the difference in the y-coordinates of the corresponding corners.
- Finally, it prints the area of the square, which is the square of the side length.

The logic in the program is correct, but there is a potential issue. The program only checks for the first scenario where `x1 == x3 and x2 == x4` and then calculates the side length using the y-coordinates of `(x1, y1)` and `(x3, y3)`. However, it does not handle the case where the y-coordinates might be in a different order, and similarly for the other scenarios.

However, the program does handle the different order of y-coordinates by using the absolute value function `abs()`. This ensures that the side length is always calculated correctly regardless of the order of the y-coordinates.

Let's verify the program with the provided example:
1. For the first test case, the corners are (1, 2), (4, 5), (1, 5), (4, 2). The program correctly identifies that `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, and calculates the side length as `abs(5 - 2) = 3`. The area is `3 ** 2 = 9`.
2. For the second test case, the corners are (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), (-1, -1). The program correctly identifies that `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, and calculates the side length as `abs(1 - (-1)) = 2`. The area is `2 ** 2 = 4`.
3. For the third test case, the corners are (45, 11), (45, 39), (17, 11), (17, 39). The program correctly identifies that `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, and calculates the side length as `abs(39 - 11) = 28`. The area is `28 ** 2 = 784`.

The program correctly handles all the provided test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.
