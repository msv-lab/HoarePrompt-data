Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description:

### Problem Description Recap:
- Two installations launch fireworks at regular intervals: every `a` and `b` minutes.
- Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.
- We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time.

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        mn = min(a, b) + m
        if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and (a != 1) and (b != 1):
            print(mn // a + mn // b + 1)
        else:
            print(mn // a + mn // b)
```

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Visibility Calculation**: The variable `mn` is set to `min(a, b) + m`. This is the time we are checking for the maximum number of fireworks.
2. **Condition Handling**:
   - If `m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and (a != 1) and (b != 1)`, it adds an extra `1` to the result.
   - Otherwise, it just sums the counts from both installations.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Overlap Handling**: The program does not correctly account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations. The condition `m % a == 0 and m % b == 0` is not sufficient to handle all overlap cases.
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `a` or `b` is `1`, the logic might not handle correctly as the condition `(a != 1) and (b != 1)` excludes such cases.
   - The logic does not consider the actual overlap of fireworks' visibility periods.

### Example Analysis:
Let's consider the following test case:
- `a = 2`, `b = 3`, `m = 5`
- The fireworks from the first installation will be visible at times: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, ...]`
- The fireworks from the second installation will be visible at times: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, ...]`
- At time `0`, there will be `1 + 1 = 2` fireworks visible.
- At time `1`, there will be `2 + 2 = 4` fireworks visible.
- At time `2`, there will be `3 + 3 = 6` fireworks visible.
- At time `3`, there will be `4 + 4 = 8` fireworks visible.
- At time `4`, there will be `5 + 5 = 10` fireworks visible.
- At time `5`, there will be `6 + 6 = 12` fireworks visible.
- At time `6`, there will be `7 + 7 = 14` fireworks visible.
- At time `7`, there will be `8 + 8 = 16` fireworks visible.
- At time `8`, there will be `9 + 9 = 18` fireworks visible.
- At time `9`, there will be `10 + 10 = 20` fireworks visible.
- At time `10`, there will be `11 + 11 = 22` fireworks visible.
- At time `11`, there will be `12 + 12 = 24` fireworks visible.
- At time `12`, there will be `13 + 13 = 26` fireworks visible.

The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is `26`, but the program will output `13 + 8 = 21` for `mn = 12`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the overlap of fireworks' visibility periods and fails in certain cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The program does not correctly account for the overlap of fireworks' visibility periods and fails in certain cases, as demonstrated by the example above.
