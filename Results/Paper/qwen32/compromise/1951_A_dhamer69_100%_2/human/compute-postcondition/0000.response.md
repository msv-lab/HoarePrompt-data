The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `t`. The values of `start` and `end` remain unchanged, and the precondition that `start` is less than or equal to `end` is still valid. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is an input integer.**
