The code snippet `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of the list `array` by 1. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even.
- `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `answer` contains the element `n`.

After executing the code `a[-1] -= 1`, the last element of `array` (which is `array[n-1]` or `array[i]`) is decreased by 1. Therefore, the value of `array[n-1]` changes from `n` to `n-1`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `i`, and `answer`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n-1` inclusive with the last element being `n-1`; `i` is `n-1`; `answer` contains the element `n`.**
