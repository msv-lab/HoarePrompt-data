The code snippet appends an element from the `array` to the `answer` list. Specifically, it appends the element at the index specified by the last element of the list `a`.

Given:
- `answer` is initially `[1]`
- `a` is initially `[1, -1]`
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `k` is an input integer
- `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive
- `i` is an integer such that `((-1)`

The code snippet `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` will:
- Access the last element of `a`, which is `-1`
- Use this `-1` as an index to access the last element of `array`
- Append this last element of `array` to `answer`

Since `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, the last element of `array` is `n`.

Thus, `answer` will be updated to `[1, n]`.

Output State: **`answer` is `[1, n]`, `a` is `[1, -1]`, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, and `i` is an integer such that `((-1)`**
