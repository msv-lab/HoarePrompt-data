Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive; `i` is 1; `a` is a list containing the integer `0`. If `i` is odd, `answer` contains the elements `n` and `1`. If `i` is even, `a[0]` is incremented by 1 and `answer` contains the elements `n` and `array[0]` (which is the element at the original `a[0]` index of `array` before the increment).**
