Output State: **the number of remaining iterations is `iterations - 1`; `n` and `k` are integers read from input; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive; `answer` is `[1]`.**

In simple terms, the number of remaining iterations, `n`, `k`, and `array` remain unchanged. A new variable `answer` is introduced and assigned the value `[1]`.
