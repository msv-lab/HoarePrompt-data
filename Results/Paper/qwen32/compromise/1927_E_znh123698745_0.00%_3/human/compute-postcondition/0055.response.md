The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state mentions that the number of remaining iterations is `iterations - 1`, but this variable is not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **the number of remaining iterations is `iterations - 1`; `n` and `k` are integers read from input.**
