Functionality: **The function reads multiple pairs of integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even. For each pair, it generates and prints a specific permutation of the numbers from 1 to `n`. The permutation alternates between the smallest and largest remaining numbers, starting with 1.**
