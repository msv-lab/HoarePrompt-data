To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze how the loop modifies the `answer` and `a` lists over time.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `answer` starts as `[1]`.
   - `a` starts as `[1, -1]`.

2. **Loop Iteration:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
   - For odd `i`, `answer` appends `array[a[-1]]` and decrements `a[-1]`.
   - For even `i`, `answer` appends `array[a[0]]` and increments `a[0]`.

### Detailed Iteration Steps:
- **Iteration 1 (i = 1, odd):**
  - `answer` becomes `[1, array[-1]]` → `[1, n]` (since `a[-1]` is `-1`).
  - `a` becomes `[1, -2]`.

- **Iteration 2 (i = 2, even):**
  - `answer` becomes `[1, n, array[1]]` → `[1, n, 2]` (since `a[0]` is `1`).
  - `a` becomes `[2, -2]`.

- **Iteration 3 (i = 3, odd):**
  - `answer` becomes `[1, n, 2, array[-2]]` → `[1, n, 2, n-1]` (since `a[-1]` is `-2`).
  - `a` becomes `[2, -3]`.

- **Iteration 4 (i = 4, even):**
  - `answer` becomes `[1, n, 2, n-1, array[2]]` → `[1, n, 2, n-1, 3]` (since `a[0]` is `2`).
  - `a` becomes `[3, -3]`.

### General Pattern:
- For odd `i`, the element `array[a[-1]]` is appended to `answer`, and `a[-1]` is decremented.
- For even `i`, the element `array[a[0]]` is appended to `answer`, and `a[0]` is incremented.

### Final State:
- The loop runs `n-1` times.
- After all iterations, `answer` will contain `n` elements.
- The `answer` list will be `[1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ...]` up to `n` elements.
- The `a` list will be `[n//2 + 1, -n//2]`.

### Output State:
- `answer` will be a list that starts with `1` and alternates between the largest and smallest remaining elements of `array`.
- `a` will be `[n//2 + 1, -n//2]`.

Output State: **answer = [1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ..., n//2, n//2 + 1 if n is even], a = [n//2 + 1, -n//2]**
