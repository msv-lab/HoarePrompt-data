Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. Bob has a rectangle of size \( a \times b \).
2. Bob tries to cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
3. From the two resulting rectangles, Bob tries to form another rectangle.
4. Two rectangles are considered the same if one is a 90Â° rotation of the other.
5. Determine if Bob can form a different rectangle from the \( a \times b \) rectangle.

### Key Observations:
- If \( a \) and \( b \) are both even, it's possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.
- If \( a \) and \( b \) are both odd, it's not possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.
- If one of \( a \) or \( b \) is even and the other is odd, it's possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.

### Analysis of the Program:
Let's break down the program logic:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Condition `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):`**:
   - The condition `(a - b == -a, a)` is a tuple, not a logical condition. It will always evaluate to `True` because it is a non-empty tuple.
   - Similarly, `(b - a == -b, b)` is also a tuple and will always evaluate to `True`.
   - Therefore, this condition is incorrect and will always result in printing 'no' when it should not.

2. **Condition `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:`**:
   - This condition checks if the difference between \( a \) and \( b \) is non-zero. However, this is not the correct logic to determine if a different rectangle can be formed.
   - The correct logic should check if at least one of \( a \) or \( b \) is even, which is covered by the first condition `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`.

3. **Overall Logic**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where one of \( a \) or \( b \) is even and the other is odd.

### Correct Logic:
- If both \( a \) and \( b \) are even, print 'yes'.
- If one of \( a \) or \( b \) is even, print 'yes'.
- If both \( a \) and \( b \) are odd, print 'no'.

### Correct Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the issues identified in the analysis. Therefore, the correctness is:

**Correctness: False**
