### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the provided program and compare it with the problem description and annotations.

#### Problem Analysis:
Bob can form a new rectangle if he can cut the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them into a different rectangle. This is possible if:
- Either `a` or `b` is even, because he can cut the rectangle along the even side and rearrange the pieces.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, the only possible cuts result in rectangles of size `a x 1` and `b x 1` (or `1 x a` and `1 x b`), which cannot form a new rectangle other than a 90Â° rotation of the original.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case to read `a` and `b`.

2. **Condition Evaluation:**
   - **First Condition:**
     ```python
     if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
         print('yes')
     ```
     - This condition checks if both `a` and `b` are even. If so, it prints "yes", which is correct based on the problem analysis.
   
   - **Second Condition:**
     ```python
     elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
         print('no')
     ```
     - This condition is syntactically incorrect and logically irrelevant. The expression `(a - b == -a, a)` creates a tuple `(False, a)` if `a - b != -a` and `(True, a)` if `a - b == -a`. The same applies to `(b - a == -b, b)`. The `or` operator then checks the truthiness of these tuples, which is always `True` because tuples are truthy unless they are empty. This condition does not reflect any meaningful logic for the problem.
   
   - **Third Condition:**
     ```python
     elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
         print('yes')
     ```
     - This condition checks if the difference `a - b` is non-zero. Since `(a - b) % 2` can never be both greater than 0 and less than 0 simultaneously, this condition is always `True` for non-zero `a - b` and `False` for `a - b == 0`. However, this condition does not correctly determine the solution because it does not account for the case where one of `a` or `b` is even.
   
   - **Else Block:**
     ```python
     else:
         print('no')
     ```
     - This block handles the case where `a == b` (i.e., `a - b == 0`). However, this is not the only case where "no" should be printed. The program should also print "no" when both `a` and `b` are odd.

#### Correct Approach:
- If either `a` or `b` is even, print "yes".
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, print "no".

#### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because:
- The second condition `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)` is syntactically incorrect and logically irrelevant.
- The third condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is always `True` for non-zero differences and does not correctly determine the solution.
- The program does not correctly handle the case where one of `a` or `b` is even.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
