Let's analyze the given code and understand what it does for each test case:

```python
for i in range(int(input())):
    a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
        print('yes')
    elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
        print('no')
    elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')
```

### Analysis of the code:

1. **First Condition:**
   ```python
   if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
       print('yes')
   ```
   This condition checks if both `a` and `b` are even. If they are, it prints 'yes'.

2. **Second Condition:**
   ```python
   elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
       print('no')
   ```
   This condition is quite misleading and incorrect. It seems like the intention might be to check if `a` is the negative of `b` or vice versa, but the way it's written, it will always evaluate to `True` because `(a - b == -a, a)` and `(b - a == -b, b)` are tuples and will always be truthy. Therefore, this condition will always print 'no' and the subsequent conditions won't be evaluated.

3. **Third Condition:**
   ```python
   elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
       print('yes')
   ```
   This condition checks if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd. If it is, it prints 'yes'. However, this condition is never reached because of the previous incorrect condition.

4. **Else Condition:**
   ```python
   else:
       print('no')
   ```
   This condition is also never reached because of the previous incorrect condition.

### Output State:

Given the above analysis, the only meaningful condition that can be evaluated is the first one. The second condition, due to its incorrect formulation, will always evaluate to `True` and print 'no'. Therefore, the output for each test case will be 'no'.

Output State: **For each of the t test cases, the output is 'no'.**
