The code snippet `s += 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. The initial state specifies that `b` is a list with at least `i + 2` elements and `i` is `i + 2`. The value of `i` is not explicitly given, but it is described as being `i + 2` which implies it's a self-referential statement and thus the value of `i` remains unchanged by this code. The variable `s` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we can infer that `s` could have any value, but after the operation, it will be its previous value plus 1.

Output State: **`b` is a list that must have at least `i + 2` elements, `i` is `i + 2`, `s` is `s + 1`.**
