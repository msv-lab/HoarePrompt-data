Postcondition: **`s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string; `a` is a list with one more element `lit[i]` appended to it if `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`; otherwise, `a` remains unchanged; `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `cp` is 0; if `a` was an empty list before, `x` is now `lit[i]` if `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`; otherwise, `x` remains the last element of `a`; if `b` is an empty list, `y` is `float('inf')`; otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`; the current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`; `y` is less than `lit[i]`; `lit[i]` is not greater than `x`; if `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`, then `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`.**
