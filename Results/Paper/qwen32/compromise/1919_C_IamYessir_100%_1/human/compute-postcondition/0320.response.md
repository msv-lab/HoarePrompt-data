The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. Given the initial state, `i` is 5, so `lit[5]` is appended to `a`. 

The other variables (`s`, `n`, `lit`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `cp`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this specific operation.

Output State: **`s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element (potentially increased by 1); `n` is an input integer greater than 0; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string; `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and now includes `lit[5]` as its last element, updating `x` to `lit[5]` if `a` was initially empty; `b` is a list that includes `lit[4]` as its last element if `lit[4] > y`, and `y` is updated to `lit[4]` if `lit[4] > y`; `s` is incremented by 1 if `lit[4] > x` and `lit[4] > y`; `cp` is 0; `i` is 5.**
