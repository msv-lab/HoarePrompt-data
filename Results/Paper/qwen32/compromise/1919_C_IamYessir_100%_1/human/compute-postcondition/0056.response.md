The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This will change the list `a` by adding the new element, but it does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `b`, `cp`, `x`, `y`, or `i` directly.

- Since `a` now contains an additional element, `x` will be updated to this new element if `a` was previously empty or if this new element is greater than the current `x`.
- The values of `b`, `y`, `cp`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- `t`, `n`, and `lit` remain as they were.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` and `b` are either empty lists or contain elements from `lit` where each element in `a` is less than or equal to `x` and each element in `b` is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `y`; `cp` remains 0; `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
