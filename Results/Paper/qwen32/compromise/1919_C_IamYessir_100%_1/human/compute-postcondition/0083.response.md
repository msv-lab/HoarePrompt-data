The code appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This affects the list `a` by adding a new element to it. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, and `x` and `y` are derived from the last elements of `a` and `b` respectively, or are positive infinity if the lists are empty. Since `a` has been modified by appending a new element, `x` will now be the newly appended element from `lit[i]`.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, `a` has a new element `lit[i]` appended to it, `x` is `lit[i]`, `y` is the last element of the list `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity.**
