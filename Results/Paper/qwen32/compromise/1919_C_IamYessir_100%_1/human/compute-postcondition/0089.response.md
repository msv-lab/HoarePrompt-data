Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same. If `lit[i] >= y`, then `x` is `lit[i]`. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of the list `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity. `y` is the last element of the list `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity or `lit[i]` if `b` was empty and `lit[i] > x`. If `lit[i] > y` and `b` was empty, `lit[i]` is appended to `b`. `a` has an additional element `lit[i]` appended to it if `lit[i] > y`.**
