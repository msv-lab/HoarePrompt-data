Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` and `b` are either empty lists or contain elements from `lit` where each element in `a` is less than or equal to `x` and each element in `b` is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `y`; `cp` remains 0; `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `b` is empty or `lit[i]` is less than or equal to the previous `x`; `y` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i]` is greater than `x` and less than or equal to the previous `y` or if `b` was previously empty and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`; `x` is less than or equal to `y`; `i` is incremented by 1.**

This means that after the if-else block executes, the integer `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is still greater than or equal to 1, and `lit` remains the same list of integers. The lists `a` and `b` maintain their properties with elements in `a` being less than or equal to `x` and elements in `b` being greater than `x` and less than or equal to `y`. The variable `cp` stays 0. The variable `x` is updated based on the conditions related to `lit[i]` and `b`, and `y` is updated based on the conditions related to `lit[i]`, `x`, and `b`. The relationship `x <= y` is preserved, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
