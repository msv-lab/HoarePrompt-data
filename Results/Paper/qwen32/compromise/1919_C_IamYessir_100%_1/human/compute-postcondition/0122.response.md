Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is an empty list; `b` is an empty list; `cp` is 0; `x` is the last element of `a` (which remains undefined since `a` is empty); `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')` (which remains `float('inf')` since `b` is empty); `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element.**

In simple terms, the only change is that `cp` has been explicitly set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
