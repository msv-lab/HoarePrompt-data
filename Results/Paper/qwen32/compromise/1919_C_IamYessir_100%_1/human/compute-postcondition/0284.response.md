The code snippet `x = float('inf')` sets the variable `x` to positive infinity. This change does not affect any other variables or their conditions. Therefore, the Output State will reflect that `x` is now `float('inf')` while all other variables retain their initial states as described.

Output State: **`s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element (potentially increased by 1), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string, `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and if `x < lit[i]`, `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element, updating `x` to `lit[i]`, `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and if `lit[i] > y`, `b` includes `lit[i]` as its last element, updating `y` to `lit[i]` and incrementing `s` by 1 if `lit[i] > x` and `lit[i] > y`, `cp` is 0, `x` is `float('inf')`, `y` are variables that are updated based on the conditions described, `i` is 4**.
