The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` adds the element `lit[i]` to the list `b`. This directly affects the list `b` by increasing its length by one and including the new element at the end.

Since `b` is updated, the variable `y` might also be affected because `y` is defined as the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty. Because we are appending an element to `b`, `y` will now be equal to `lit[i]`.

No other variables are directly changed by this code snippet. The values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `cp`, `x`, `s`, and `i` remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` and `b` are lists containing elements `lit[i]` based on the conditions `lit[i] > x` if `x > y`, otherwise `lit[i] > y` for `a`, and `lit[i] <= x` if `x > y`, otherwise `y >= lit[i] > x` for `b`; `cp` is 0; `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, or the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty; `y` is `lit[i]`; `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `i` is `i + 1`.**
