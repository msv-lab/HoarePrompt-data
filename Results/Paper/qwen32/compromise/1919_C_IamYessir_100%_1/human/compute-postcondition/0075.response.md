The code assigns the value of the last element of the list `b` to the variable `y`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged based on the initial state provided.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, `x` is the last element of the list `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity, `y` is the last element of the list `b`.**
