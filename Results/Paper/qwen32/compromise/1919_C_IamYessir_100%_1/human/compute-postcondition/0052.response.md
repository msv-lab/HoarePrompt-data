The code snippet `y = b[-1]` assigns the value of the last element of list `b` to the variable `y`. Since `y` was previously defined as `float('inf')` if `b` was an empty list, or the last element of `b` if `b` was not empty, this operation will not change `y` if `b` is non-empty. If `b` is empty, this operation will raise an `IndexError` because `b[-1]` cannot be accessed. However, based on the precondition that `y` is already set to the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, we can assume `b` is non-empty in this context.

Therefore, the output state will be the same as the initial state with the understanding that `y` is explicitly set to the last element of `b` again, which it already is if `b` is non-empty.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` and `b` are either empty lists or contain elements from `lit` where each element in `a` is less than or equal to `x` and each element in `b` is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `y`; `cp` remains 0; `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` is an empty list, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is the last element of `b`; and `x` is less than or equal to `y`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
