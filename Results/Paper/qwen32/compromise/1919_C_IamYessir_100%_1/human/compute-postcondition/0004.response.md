The code snippet provided only initializes the variable `cp` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `b`) are affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is an empty list; `b` is an empty list; `cp` is 0.**
