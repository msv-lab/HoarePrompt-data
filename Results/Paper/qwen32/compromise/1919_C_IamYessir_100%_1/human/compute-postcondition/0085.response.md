The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This affects the list `a` by adding a new element to it, but it does not change the values of `i`, `n`, `x`, or `y`. The value of `x` remains the last element of the list `a` (which is now the newly appended element), and `y` remains the last element of the list `b` or positive infinity if `b` is empty.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, `x` is `lit[i]`, `y` is the last element of the list `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, and `a` has an additional element `lit[i]` appended to it.**
