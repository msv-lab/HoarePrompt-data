The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`a`, `cp`, `b`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is incremented by 1, `a` remains unchanged, `cp` remains 0, `b` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 2.

Output State: **`s` is incremented by 1, `a` remains unchanged, `cp` remains 0, `b` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 2.**
