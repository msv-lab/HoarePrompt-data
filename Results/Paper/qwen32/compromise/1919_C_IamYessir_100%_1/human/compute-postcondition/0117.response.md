To determine what will be printed by the `print(s)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable represents the number of test cases or iterations, but it doesn't directly affect the value of `s` in the context of a single execution.
2. **`n`**: An integer representing the number of elements in the list `lit`.
3. **`lit`**: A list of integers obtained from the input. The exact values of the elements in `lit` are not specified, but we know it has `n` elements.
4. **`a`**: A list of integers. The exact values and length of `a` are not specified.
5. **`b`**: A list of integers. The exact values and length of `b` are not specified.
6. **`cp`**: An integer initialized to 0. It is not used in the calculation of `s`.
7. **`x`**: The last element of the list `a`. If `a` is empty, the value of `x` is not relevant for calculating `s`.
8. **`y`**: The last element of the list `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`. The value of `y` is also not relevant for calculating `s`.
9. **`s`**: An integer representing the sum of:
   - The number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element.
   - The number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element.

### Calculation of `s`:
- `s` is calculated based on the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element.
- `s` is also calculated based on the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element.

Since the exact values and lengths of `a` and `b` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `s`. However, we can describe the value of `s` based on the given information.

### Description of `s`:
- `s` is the sum of two counts:
  1. The number of times an element in the list `a` is greater than its previous element.
  2. The number of times an element in the list `b` is greater than its previous element.

### Final Output:
Given the above analysis, the `print(s)` statement will output the calculated value of `s` based on the given conditions. Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `s`.

Output: **s (where s is the sum of the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element and the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element)**
