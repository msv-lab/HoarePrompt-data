The code snippet creates a new list `lit` by reading an input string, splitting it by spaces, and converting each split string into an integer. The variables `s` and `n` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `n` is an input integer; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string.**
