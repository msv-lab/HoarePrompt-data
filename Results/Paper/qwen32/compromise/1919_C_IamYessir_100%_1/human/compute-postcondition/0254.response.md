The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` adds the element `lit[i]` to the end of the list `b`. This means that the length of `b` increases by 1, and the last element of `b` is now `lit[i]`. 

The value of `y` is the last element of `b`, so `y` is now `lit[i]`. The condition `y` is less than or equal to `lit[i]` remains valid since `y` is now `lit[i]`.

No other variables are affected by this operation. The value of `s` (the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element) might change if the newly appended element `lit[i]` is greater than the previous element in `b`, but this is not specified in the given initial state and thus cannot be determined.

Output State: **`s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string; `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list and now includes `lit[i]` as its last element; `cp` is 0; if `a` is an empty list, `x` is `float('inf')`; otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is `lit[i]`; the current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`; `y` is less than or equal to `lit[i]`.**
