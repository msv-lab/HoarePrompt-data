You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of size n . You will do the following process to
calculate your penalty:

  1. Split array a into two (possibly empty) subsequences^\dagger s and t such that every element of a is either in s or t^\ddagger . 
  2. For an array b of size m , define the penalty p(b) of an array b as the number of indices i between 1 and m - 1 where b_i < b_{i + 1} . 
  3. The total penalty you will receive is p(s) + p(t) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subsequence of a sequence y if x can be obtained
from y by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

^\ddagger Some valid ways to split array a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (s,t) are
([3,4,1,5],[1]) , ([1,1],[3,4,5]) and ([\,],[3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,4,5],[1]) , ([3,1,4,1],[1,5]) and ([1,3,4],[5,1]) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1\le n\le 2\cdot
10^5 ) — the size of the array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) —
the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

Note

In the first test case, a possible way to split a is s=[2,4,5] and t=[1,3] .
The penalty is p(s)+p(t)=2 + 1 =3 .

In the second test case, a possible way to split a is s=[8,3,1] and
t=[2,1,7,4,3] . The penalty is p(s)+p(t)=0 + 1 =1 .

In the third test case, a possible way to split a is s=[\,] and t=[3,3,3,3,3]
. The penalty is p(s)+p(t)=0 + 0 =0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not always produce the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the code and identify a potential issue.

The code attempts to split the array `lit` into two subsequences `a` and `b` and calculates the penalties for both subsequences. However, the logic for splitting the array does not guarantee that the penalty is minimized. The code seems to be making arbitrary choices about which subsequence to add the current element to, based on the last elements of `a` and `b`.

Let's consider a specific test case to demonstrate the issue:

**Test Case:**

```
1
4
1 3 2 4
```

**Expected Output:**

```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**

One optimal way to split the array is `s = [1, 2, 4]` and `t = [3]`. The penalty for `s` is 2 (since `1 < 2` and `2 < 4`), and the penalty for `t` is 0. Thus, the total penalty is 2.

**Actual Output from the Code:**

The code might produce a different result because it does not always make the optimal choice for splitting the array. For example, it might end up with subsequences that have a higher total penalty.

Let's see how the code processes the test case:

1. Initialize `a` and `b` as empty lists.
2. Process the first element `1`: Add it to `a` (since `a` is empty).
3. Process the second element `3`: Add it to `a` (since `a[-1] = 1` and `1 < 3`).
4. Process the third element `2`: Add it to `b` (since `a[-1] = 3` and `3 > 2`).
5. Process the fourth element `4`: Add it to `a` (since `a[-1] = 3` and `3 < 4`).

The subsequences end up being `a = [1, 3, 4]` and `b = [2]`. The penalty for `a` is 2 (since `1 < 3` and `3 < 4`), and the penalty for `b` is 0. Thus, the total penalty is 2, which is correct in this case. However, this is not guaranteed for all cases.

To ensure the code is correct, it must always produce the minimum possible penalty for any input. The current logic does not guarantee this. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

**Conclusion:**

Since the code does not guarantee the minimum penalty for all possible inputs, the correctness is **False**.
