### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement.

Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires splitting the array into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty for each subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The goal is to find the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` and the string `s` itself.
   - It then counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string.
   - Finally, it prints the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters.

3. **Issues with the Program**:
   - The program does not perform any splitting of the array into subarrays.
   - It simply calculates the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which does not reflect the penalty calculation as described in the problem.
   - The penalty calculation involves considering the absolute value of the sum of each subarray and its length, which the program does not do.

4. **Verification with Examples**:
   - **Example 1**: For the input `+`, the correct output is `1` because the array is `[1]` and the penalty is `|1| * 1 = 1`.
   - **Example 2**: For the input `-----`, the correct output is `5` because the optimal split is `([-1], [-1], [-1], [-1], [-1])` and the total penalty is `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5`.
   - **Example 3**: For the input `+-+-+-`, the correct output is `0` because the optimal split is `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])` and the total penalty is `0 + 0 = 0`.

   The provided program would output `1`, `5`, and `0` for the above examples respectively, but these outputs are not derived from the correct penalty calculation process.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect as it does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the penalty based on the described problem constraints.
