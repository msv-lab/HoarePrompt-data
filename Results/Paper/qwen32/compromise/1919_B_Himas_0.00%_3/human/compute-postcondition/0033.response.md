Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `s` is the input integer, `e` is a non-empty string, `i` is `i + 1`. If `q` equals '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 1 and `M` is 1. `q` is the next character in `e`.**

Explanation: The value of `P` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
