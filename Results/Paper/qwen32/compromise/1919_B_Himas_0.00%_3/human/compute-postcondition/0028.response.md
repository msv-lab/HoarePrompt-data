Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is the input integer, `e` is a non-empty string, `P` is 1, `M` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`, and `q` equals '+'**

Explanation: The value of `P` has been incremented by 1, so `P` is now 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
