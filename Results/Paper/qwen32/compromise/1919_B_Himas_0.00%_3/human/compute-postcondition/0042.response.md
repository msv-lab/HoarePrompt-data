The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the input to the `range` function, which is `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented again by 1 from its current value.

Given that `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 again.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `s` is the input integer, `e` is the input string, `P` is the count of '+' characters in `e`, `M` is the count of characters in `e` that are not '+', `i` is `i + 2`**
