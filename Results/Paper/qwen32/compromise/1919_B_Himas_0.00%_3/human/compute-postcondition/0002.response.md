Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is an input integer, `e` is an input string.**

In this output state, the variables `t` and `n` retain their initial constraints and values. The variable `s` remains as an input integer, and a new variable `e` is introduced, which holds the value of the next input provided as a string.
