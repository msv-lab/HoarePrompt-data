Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is 5 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `m` remains 1, `n` must be at least 2, `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, then `idx1` is set to `i`, `idx2` remains -1, `p1` is incremented by 1, and `p2` remains 0. Otherwise, `idx1` remains -1, `idx2` is set to `i`, `p1` remains 0, and `p2` is incremented by 1. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
