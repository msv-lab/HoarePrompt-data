The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (let's call it `i_end`) and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `i_end + 1`. The condition `i < n - 1` must still hold true for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is 5 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `m` remains 1, `n` is at least 2, `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is `i_end + 1`**
