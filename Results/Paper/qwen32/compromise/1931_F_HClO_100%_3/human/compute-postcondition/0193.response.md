The given code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `p1`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is incremented by 1, `n` must be at least 3, `m` remains the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding those equal to `a1`, `i` is 3, `idx1` is 3, `p1` is 1. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no further changes are made to `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, or `p2`.**
