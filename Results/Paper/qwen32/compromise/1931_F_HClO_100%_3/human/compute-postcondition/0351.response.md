The given code snippet assigns the list `l1` to the variable `l`. This means that `l` now holds the same reference as `l1`. No other variables are modified by this assignment.

Given the initial state, the only change is the introduction of `l` as a new variable that references `l1`.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged unless `m` is 2 in which case `t` remains unchanged, `val` is an empty list, `p1` and `p2` are updated based on the conditions inside the loop, `a1` and `a2` are unchanged, `l1` has `a1` inserted at `idx2`, `l2` is unchanged, `l11` and `l22` are unchanged, `i` is `n-2` if the loop completes all iterations, `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, and the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`; `l` is `l1`.**
