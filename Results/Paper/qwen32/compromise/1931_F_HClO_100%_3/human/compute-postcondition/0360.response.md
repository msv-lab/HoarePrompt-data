To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head:

```python
for _ in range(m - 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the expression `m - 2` is greater than 0. This means that `m` must be greater than 2.

Let's analyze the other variables mentioned in the problem statement to see if they need adjustment based on the loop head:

- `n`: The problem states that `n` is unchanged, so no adjustment is needed.
- `m`: As discussed, `m` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute.
- `_`: This is a throwaway variable used in the loop head, and its value doesn't affect the loop execution condition.

Given these points, the only state that needs adjustment is `m`.

Thus, the adjusted state for the loop to execute is:

State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` must be greater than 2**
