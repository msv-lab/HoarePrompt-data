Postcondition: **`val` is a list containing at least three tuples, specifically `[(a3, l3), (a3, l3), (a3, l3)]`, and the current tuple `(a3, l3)` is the third tuple in the list. If `l3` is not equal to the list `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change occurs in the control flow related to the if-else block.**
