Output State: **`val` is a list containing at least one tuple, specifically `[(a3, l3), (a3, l3), (a3, l3)]`, and the current tuple `(a3, l3)` is the second tuple in the list; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The list `val` remains unchanged, still containing the tuples `[(a3, l3), (a3, l3), (a3, l3)]`, and the current tuple `(a3, l3)` is still the second tuple in the list. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
