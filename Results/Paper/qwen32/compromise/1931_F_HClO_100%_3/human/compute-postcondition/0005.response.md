In the given initial state, we have the following details:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.
- `m` is explicitly set to 1.

The Python code snippet contains a single `print` statement:
```python
print('yes')
```

This `print` statement directly outputs the string `'yes'`. It does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `m` since it is printing a hardcoded string.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
