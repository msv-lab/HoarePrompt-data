Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop completes all iterations and prints 'yes'. `t` is incremented by 1. `n` remains the first integer from the input. `m` remains the second integer from the input. `a1` is the first integer from the new input. `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input. `a2` is the first integer from the latest input. `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input. `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding those equal to `a2`. `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding those equal to `a1`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    input()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the first integer from the input, `m` must be at least 3, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding those equal to `a1`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the first integer from the input, `m` must be at least 3, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding those equal to `a1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the first integer from the input, `m` must be at least 3, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding those equal to `a1`. An input operation has been performed but its value is not stored or used.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
