The code sets `idx2` to `n - 2`. The value of `n` is an integer read from the input, and since `idx1` was initially not `-1` (specifically `n - 2`), its value remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is 5 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `m` remains 1, `n` is an integer read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `val` is an empty list.**
