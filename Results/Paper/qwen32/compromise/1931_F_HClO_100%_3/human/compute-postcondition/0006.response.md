The `continue` statement does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, or `m`. It is typically used within loops to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given context, the `continue` statement has no effect here.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `m` is 1.**
