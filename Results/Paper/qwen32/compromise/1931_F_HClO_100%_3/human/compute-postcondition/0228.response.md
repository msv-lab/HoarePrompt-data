Postcondition: **`t` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the first integer from the input, `m` remains the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding those equal to `a1`, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first integer from the latest input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input. If the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, then `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`, and `l` is a list containing the same elements as `l1`. Otherwise, `l2` is a list containing elements from the latest input with `a2` inserted at position `n - 2`, and `l` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding those equal to `a1`. If `m == 2` and `idx2 == -1` and `idx1 != -1`, then `idx1` is set to `n - 2` and `idx2` is set to `n - 2`. Otherwise, `idx1` remains -1 and `idx2` remains unchanged.**
