The code snippet assigns the list `l1` to the variable `l`. No other variables are modified by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is 5 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `m` remains 1, `n` is an integer read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at `idx2`, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `idx1` is either `n - 2` or -1, `idx2` is not -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `val` is an empty list, `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at `idx2`. If `idx2` was -1 and `idx1` was not -1, then both `idx1` and `idx2` are updated to `n - 2`. Additionally, `idx1` is greater than `idx2`.**
