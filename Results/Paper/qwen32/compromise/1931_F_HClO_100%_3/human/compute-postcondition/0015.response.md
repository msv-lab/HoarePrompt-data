The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `m - 2` times. The loop will execute as long as the range `(m - 2)` has more iterations left.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have completed one iteration, meaning the range `(m - 2)` has been decremented by 1. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the range accordingly.

Given that the loop iterates `m - 2` times, if we have just finished one iteration, the remaining number of iterations is `m - 3`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is an integer such that m ≥ 3, `n` is an integer read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, and `l11` is not equal to `l22`. A new line of input has been read but not stored in any variable.**

Since the loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable, its specific value does not matter for the state description. The important part is ensuring that the loop can still execute, which means we need to reflect the decrement in the number of iterations left.
