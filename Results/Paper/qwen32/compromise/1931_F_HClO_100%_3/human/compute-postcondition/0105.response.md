Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `m` is 5 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `m` remains 1. `n` is an integer read from the input. `a1` is the first integer from the new input line. `l1` is a list of integers. `a2` is the first integer from the new input line. `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`. `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`. `idx1` is either `n - 2` or -1. `idx2` is not -1. `p1` is 0. `p2` is 0. `val` is either an empty list or a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`. If `idx1 < idx2`, `l2` has `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, and `l` is the same as `l2`. If `idx1 > idx2`, `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at `idx2`. If `idx1 == idx2`, `m` is 1 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `m` remains 0, and `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`. If `a3` is the first integer from the new input line and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with `a1` inserted at position `idx2` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`; otherwise, `l2` has `a2` inserted at the position `idx1`, and `l` is a list that holds the same value as `l2`.**
