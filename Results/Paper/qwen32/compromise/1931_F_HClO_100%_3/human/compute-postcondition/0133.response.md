The initial state provides us with some context about the program's behavior, but it doesn't give specific values for `n`, `m`, or `t`. It only mentions that a loop completes all iterations and prints 'yes', and that `t` is incremented by 1. However, these details do not affect the `print('yes')` statement directly.

Given the `print('yes')` statement, it is clear that the string 'yes' will be printed regardless of the values of `n`, `m`, or `t`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **yes**
