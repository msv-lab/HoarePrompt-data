Output State: **`t` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 3, `val` contains `m - 2` tuples `(a3, l3)`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed. The current `(a3, l3)` is the next tuple in `val`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without changing the values of any variables. Thus, all variables retain their initial states as described in the initial condition.
