The given Python code snippet modifies the list `l2` by inserting the value `a2` at the position `idx1`. This operation changes the structure of `l2` but does not affect other variables unless they are directly dependent on `l2`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `m` is 2 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `m` remains 1
- `n` is an integer read from the input
- `a1` is the first integer from the new input line
- `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line
- `a2` is the first integer from the new input line
- `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`
- `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`
- `idx1` is either `n - 2` or -1
- `idx2` is not -1
- `p1` is 0
- `p2` is 0
- `val` is an empty list
- If `idx2` was -1 and `idx1` was not -1, then both `idx1` and `idx2` are updated to `n - 2`
- Additionally, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`
- If `m` equals 2, the conditions remain as specified in the if part
- `a3` is the first integer from the new input line
- `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line
- The index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`

The code snippet `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts `a2` into `l2` at the position `idx1`. This means that the element originally at `idx1` and all subsequent elements in `l2` are shifted one position to the right.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is 2 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `m` remains 1, `n` is an integer read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `idx1` is either `n - 2` or -1, `idx2` is not -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first integer from the new input line, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`, and `l2` has `a2` inserted at the position `idx1` shifting all subsequent elements one position to the right.**
