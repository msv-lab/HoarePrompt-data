### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the problem statement in detail.

#### Problem Statement:
- The game involves a sequence of integers `a` which indicates the positions of players to be kicked out in each round.
- Players are lined up in a row, and in each round, players at the positions specified by `a` are removed from the game.
- If a specified position does not exist in the current lineup, that position is skipped.
- The game ends when no players are kicked out in a round.
- We need to determine the number of players remaining after the game ends for different initial player counts.

#### Code Explanation:
- **Function `func_1(n, p)`**:
  - `n` is the initial number of players.
  - `p` is a list of positions of players to be kicked out in each round.
  - The function iteratively subtracts the number of players that can be kicked out in each round from `n` until `n` is less than the smallest position in `p`.
  - The function returns the number of players remaining after the game ends.

- **Function `func_2()`**:
  - This function handles multiple test cases.
  - For each test case, it reads the number of positions `k`, the number of queries `q`, the list of positions `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
  - For each initial player count `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` to compute the number of remaining players and prints the results.

### Analysis:
- The function `func_1(n, p)` correctly implements the logic of the game. It iteratively removes players at the specified positions until no more players can be removed.
- The function `func_2()` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results in the required format.

However, there is a critical issue in the provided code. The function `func_2()` prints the results for each query after each computation, which is not the correct behavior according to the problem statement. The problem statement specifies that the results for all queries in a test case should be printed on a single line after all computations are done for that test case.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the provided code does not meet the problem's output requirements exactly. Therefore, the correctness of the program should be **False**.

Correctness: **False**
