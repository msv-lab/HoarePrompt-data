To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the provided initial state and the code step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown
1. **`qs`**: A list of integers obtained from the input, with at least one integer.
2. **`res`**: A list containing one element, which is the result of the function `func_1(n, p)`.
3. **`t`**: Remains unchanged (its value is not specified or used in the given print statement).
4. **`k`**: The first input integer.
5. **`q`**: The second input integer.
6. **`p`**: A list of integers obtained from the input.

### Code Analysis
The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Explanation
- **`map(str, res)`**: This converts each element of the list `res` to a string.
- **`' '.join(...)`**: This joins the string representations of the elements in `res` with a space character as the separator.

### Determining the Output
From the initial state, we know that `res` is a list containing exactly one element, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`. The exact value of this element cannot be determined without knowing the implementation of `func_1` and the values of `n` and `p`. However, we do know that `res` contains this single element.

Let's denote the single element in `res` as `result_of_func_1`. Therefore, `res` can be described as `[result_of_func_1]`.

When the `print` statement is executed, it will convert `result_of_func_1` to a string and print it, as there is only one element in the list.

### Final Output Description
Output: **result_of_func_1 (where result_of_func_1 is the single element in the list `res`, obtained from `func_1(n, p)`)**

This provides the most precise description of what will be printed based on the given precondition.
