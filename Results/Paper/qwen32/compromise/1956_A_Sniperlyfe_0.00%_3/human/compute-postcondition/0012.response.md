The only variable in the loop head is `n`, which takes values from the list `qs`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to update `n` to the next element in `qs`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is the next element in the list `qs`
- `p` is a list of integers provided by user input representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `k` and `q` are integers obtained from the input
- `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the user input and must have at least one element
- `res` is a list containing two elements, the first being the output of `func_1(n, p)` and the second being the output of `func_1(n, p)` again

Since `n` is the current element from `qs` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `n` should be updated to the subsequent element in `qs`. The other variables (`p`, `t`, `k`, `q`, `qs`, and `res`) do not need to be adjusted according to the loop head.

State: **`n` is the next element in the list `qs` after the current one, `p` is a list of integers provided by user input representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round, `t` must be greater than 0, `k` and `q` are integers obtained from the input, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the user input and must have at least one element, `res` is a list containing two elements, the first being the output of `func_1(n, p)` and the second being the output of `func_1(n, p)` again**
