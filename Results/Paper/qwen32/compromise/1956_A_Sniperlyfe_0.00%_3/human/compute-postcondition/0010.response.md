Output State: **`n` is the next element in the list `qs`, `p` is a list of integers provided by user input representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round, `t` must be greater than 0, `k` and `q` are integers obtained from the input, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the user input and must have at least one element, `res` is a list containing two elements, the first being the output of `func_1(n, p)` and the second being the output of `func_1(n, p)` again.**

In simple terms, the output state is that `res` now contains two elements, both of which are the result of the function `func_1(n, p)` called twice. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
