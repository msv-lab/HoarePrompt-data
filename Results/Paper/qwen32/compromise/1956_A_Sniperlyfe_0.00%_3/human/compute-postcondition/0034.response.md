The provided code snippet only modifies the variable `qs` by reading a new list of integers from the input. The other variables (`k`, `q`, `res`, `t`, `p`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `qs` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is a list containing as many elements as there are integers in the original `qs`, where each element is the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in the original `qs`, `t` is `x-1`, `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.**

In natural language: The variable `qs` is updated to a new list of integers from the input, while the other variables (`k`, `q`, `res`, `t`, `p`) retain their original values.
