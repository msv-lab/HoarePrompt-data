The only variable in the loop head is `n`, which is being iterated over the list `qs`. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to the next value in the list `qs` for the loop to execute one more time. The other variables (`qs`, `res`, `t`, `k`, and `p`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Given that `qs` is a list of integers and `n` is the current element from `qs` at the end of the previous iteration, `n` should be updated to the next element in `qs` for the next iteration.

State: **`qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 integers, `res` is a list containing one element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`, `t` remains unchanged, `k` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is the next integer in `qs`**
