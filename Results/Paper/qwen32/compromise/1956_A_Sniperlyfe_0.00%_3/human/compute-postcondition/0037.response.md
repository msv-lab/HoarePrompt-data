To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the code snippet on the variables. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State Recap**:
   - `k` is the first input integer.
   - `q` is the second input integer.
   - `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element.
   - `res` is an empty list.
   - `t` is `x-1` (Note: `x` is not defined in the initial state, so we assume `t` is undefined or irrelevant to the current operation).
   - `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `n` is the first element of `qs`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - `res.append(func_1(n, p))`: This line calls a function `func_1` with `n` and `p` as arguments and appends the result to the list `res`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - `res` was initially an empty list. After the execution of the code, `res` will contain one element, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
   - The values of `k`, `q`, `qs`, `t`, and `p` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.

4. **Output State**:
   - `k` is the first input integer.
   - `q` is the second input integer.
   - `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element.
   - `res` now contains one element, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `t` is `x-1` (unchanged, assuming `x` is not defined or irrelevant).
   - `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input (unchanged).
   - `n` is the first element of `qs` (unchanged).

Output State: **`k` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element, `res` contains one element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`, `t` is `x-1`, `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is the first element of `qs`.**
