The only variable in the loop head is `n`, which is being iterated over the list `qs`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to reflect the next value in the list `qs`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` was set to the last value from `qs` that was processed. To execute the loop one more time, `n` should be set to the next value in the list `qs`. 

Given that `qs` must have at least one element, we can assume that there is at least one more value to process if the loop has not yet completed all elements in `qs`.

State: **`n` is the next element in the list `qs`, `p` is a list of integers provided by user input representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round, `t` must be greater than 0, `k` and `q` are integers obtained from the input, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the user input and must have at least one element, `res` is a list containing one element, which is the output of `func_1(n, p)`**
