The code snippet provided appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. Given the initial state, `j` is 1, and `eta` is not mentioned, so we can infer that `eta` was initially an empty list. After the execution of the code, `eta` will contain the single element `1`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is the new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `w` is a list of `n` integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is 1, `eta` is [1]**
