Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `w` is a list of `n` integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list containing all indices from 0 to `n` where `q[j] > 0`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`, `eta_ln` is not equal to 1, `res` is `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, eta_ln):
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
    rho += q[eta[j]]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `w` is a list of `n` integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list containing all indices from 0 to `n` where `q[j] > 0`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and must be greater than 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]] + q[eta[j]]`, `res` is `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `w` is a list of `n` integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is 1, `eta` is a list containing all indices from 0 to `n` where `q[j] > 0`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and must be greater than 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]] + 2*q[eta[j]]`, `res` is updated to include `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` added to its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `w` is a list of `n` integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is 2, `eta` is a list containing all indices from 0 to `n` where `q[j] > 0`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and must be greater than 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]] + 3*q[eta[j]]`, `res` is updated to include `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` added to its previous value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
