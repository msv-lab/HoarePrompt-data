Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is the new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except each `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for all j from 0 to n-1.**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state is that `t`, `i`, and `buffer` remain unchanged from their initial states. The list `q` will have each element at index `w[j]` incremented by 1 for every occurrence of `j` from 0 to `n-1`. Essentially, `q` will count the occurrences of each integer in the list `w`.
