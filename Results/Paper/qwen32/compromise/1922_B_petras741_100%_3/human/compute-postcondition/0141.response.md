Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `w` is a list of `n` integers derived from the new input, and `n` is less than 3. No additional changes are made to `q`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`, or `res`.**
