`eta_ln` is assigned the value of the length of `eta`. The length of `eta` is the count of all values `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j] > 0`. The values of `j` and the condition for `eta` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `n + 1`, `eta` contains all values `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j] > 0`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`.

Output State: **`j` is `n + 1`, `eta` contains all values `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j] > 0`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`.**
