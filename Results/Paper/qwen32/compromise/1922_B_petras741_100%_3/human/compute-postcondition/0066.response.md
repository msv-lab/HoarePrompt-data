The only variable in the loop head is `j`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `j` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `i` is 1
- `buffer` is an empty list
- `n` is the new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5
- `w` is a list of `n` integers derived from the input
- `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`
- `j` is 0
- If `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta` is a list containing the single element 0. Otherwise, `eta` remains an empty list.

Since the loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `n`, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is the new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `w` is a list of `n` integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is 1**
