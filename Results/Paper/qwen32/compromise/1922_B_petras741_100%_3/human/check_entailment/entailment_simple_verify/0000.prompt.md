You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, the loop has computed and printed the number of ways to choose 3 elements from the list `w` such that at least two of them are the same, considering all possible values in `w`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The logic for counting valid combinations is flawed, particularly in how it handles the triangle inequality condition.

The triangle inequality theorem states that for any three sides of a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. In this problem, the lengths of the sticks are given as powers of 2, i.e., \(2^{a_i}\). The program does not check this condition explicitly.

Let's consider a simple case to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Possible combinations of sticks are: (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 4), (1, 3, 4), (2, 3, 4).
- Only (2, 3, 4) can form a non-degenerate triangle because:
  - \(2^2 + 2^3 > 2^4\) is false (4 + 8 = 12, which is not greater than 16).
  - \(2^1 + 2^3 > 2^4\) is false (2 + 8 = 10, which is not greater than 16).
  - \(2^1 + 2^2 > 2^4\) is false (2 + 4 = 6, which is not greater than 16).
  - \(2^2 + 2^4 > 2^3\) is true (4 + 16 = 20, which is greater than 8).
  - \(2^1 + 2^4 > 2^3\) is true (2 + 16 = 18, which is greater than 8).
  - \(2^1 + 2^3 > 2^2\) is true (2 + 8 = 10, which is greater than 4).

Hence, only (2, 3, 4) is a valid combination.

However, the program does not implement the triangle inequality check and would likely count all combinations of three sticks as valid, leading to an incorrect result.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
