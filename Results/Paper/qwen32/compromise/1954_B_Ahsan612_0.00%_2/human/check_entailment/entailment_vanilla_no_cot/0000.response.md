Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful. The logic in the program is flawed because it only considers the minimum length of consecutive identical elements but does not account for the correct condition to make the array non-beautiful after removals.

To solve this correctly, we need to consider the structure of the beautiful array and determine how to break the pattern of elements that can be replaced. Here's a corrected approach:

1. Traverse the array and identify segments of consecutive identical elements.
2. For each segment, check if removing elements from it can make the array non-beautiful.
3. The minimum number of removals required to make the array non-beautiful is the smallest segment length that, when removed, disrupts the beautiful property.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if n == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        segments = []
        current_num = ar[0]
        current_length = 1
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ar[i] == current_num:
                current_length += 1
            else:
                segments.append(current_length)
                current_num = ar[i]
                current_length = 1
        
        segments.append(current_length)
        
        if len(segments) == 1:
            print(-1)
        else:
            min_removal = min(segments)
            print(min_removal)

func()
```

This program correctly identifies the smallest segment of consecutive identical elements and outputs the minimum number of removals required to disrupt the beautiful property of the array. If the array consists of only one segment (all elements are the same), it outputs `-1` as the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removals.
