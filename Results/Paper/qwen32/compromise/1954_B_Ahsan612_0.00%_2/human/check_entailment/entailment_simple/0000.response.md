### Reasoning:

The given program aims to solve the problem by identifying the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. The core idea of the program is to find the minimum length of consecutive occurrences of any number in the array. If all elements in the array are the same (i.e., the array is composed of a single repeated number), then it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements, and the program should return -1. Otherwise, removing the minimum number of consecutive elements of the same number will make the array non-beautiful.

Let's analyze the provided code step by step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `same` is initialized to 1 to count the length of consecutive elements.
   - `num` is set to the first element of the array.
   - `minn` is initialized to infinity to keep track of the minimum length of consecutive elements.

2. **Loop through the array**:
   - The loop iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the current element is the same as `num`, it increments the `same` counter.
   - If the current element is different from `num`, it updates `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and updates `num` to the current element.
   - After each iteration, it increments the index `i`.

3. **Final update**:
   - After the loop, it performs a final update of `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same` to account for the last sequence of consecutive elements.

4. **Output**:
   - If `minn` is still infinity (which should not happen with a valid input since the array is beautiful and thus has at least one element), it prints -1.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`, which represents the minimum length of consecutive elements.

### Correctness:

The program correctly identifies the minimum length of consecutive elements in the array, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful. If the array is composed of a single repeated number, it correctly returns -1. The logic is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

However, there is a small issue in the code. The `i += 1` inside the `else` block is unnecessary and can be removed. The increment of `i` should only happen once per iteration of the loop.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
                num = ar[i]
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)
        if minn == inf:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)

#State: For each test case, the output will be the minimum length of consecutive occurrences of any number in the array `ar`.
```

Given the explanation and the minor correction, the original logic of the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
