Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input and must have at least `i + 1` elements; `i` is `i + 1`; `same` is 3 if `ar[i]` equals `num` (i.e., `ar[0]`), otherwise `same` is 2 and `num` is updated to `ar[2]`; `minn` remains `inf` if `ar[i]` equals `num`, otherwise `minn` is updated to 1**

Explanation: The value of `same` is incremented by 1. If `ar[i]` equals `num` (i.e., `ar[0]`), `same` becomes 3. Otherwise, `same` becomes 2 and `num` is updated to `ar[2]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, and `minn` remain unchanged as per the given conditions.
