The code snippet assigns the value `inf` (infinity) to the variable `minn`. This change affects only the variable `minn`, and all other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input; `same` is 1; `num` is the first number in `ar`; `minn` is `inf`; `i` is equal to the length of the new `ar`.**
