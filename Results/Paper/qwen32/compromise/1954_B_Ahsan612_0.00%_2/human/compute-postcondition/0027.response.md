The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given the initial conditions, `i` was either 4 or 5. If `i` was 4, it becomes 5. If `i` was 5, it becomes 6. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with more than 5 elements, `minn` is 1. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 5 and `same` is 3. Otherwise, `i` is 6 and `same` is 1.**
