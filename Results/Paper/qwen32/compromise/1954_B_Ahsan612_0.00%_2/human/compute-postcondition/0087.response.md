To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `i < len(ar)` is true right before the loop starts. The variables involved in the loop condition are `i` and `len(ar)`.

Given:
- `i` is 1.
- `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input.

For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than the length of `ar`. Since `i` is already 1, the length of `ar` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, we need to ensure that the list `ar` has at least two elements.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input and must have at least 2 elements; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[0]`; `minn` is `inf`; `i` is 1**
