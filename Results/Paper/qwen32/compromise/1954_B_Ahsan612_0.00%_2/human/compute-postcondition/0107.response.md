Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input and must have at least `i + 2` elements; `i` is now `i + 1` and must be less than `len(ar) - 1`; `same`, `num`, and `minn` are updated as per the loop logic.**

In simple terms, the variable `i` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and constraints.
