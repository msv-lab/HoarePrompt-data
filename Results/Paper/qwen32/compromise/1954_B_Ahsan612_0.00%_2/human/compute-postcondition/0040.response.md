The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means that the loop will execute a number of times based on the integer input provided. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the program state directly.

Given the provided state at the end of the previous iteration, the only thing we need to adjust is the input integer that dictates how many times the loop will execute. Since the loop runs for a number of times specified by `int(input())`, we need to consider the state of the input integer.

However, the provided state does not give us the current value of the input integer. We only know that `i` is equal to the length of `ar` at the end of the previous iteration, and other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, `minn`) are part of the loop body and do not affect the loop head.

Since the loop head only depends on the input integer, and we do not have the current value of that integer, we can only assume that the input integer is decremented by 1 after each iteration (as is typical for such loops). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the input integer must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers; `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of the last number in `ar` if it is the same as the previous one, otherwise 1; `num` is the last number in `ar`; `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and `same`; `i` is equal to the length of `ar`. The input integer for the loop is at least 1.**
