The variable `num` is assigned the value of the first element of the list `ar`. Therefore, the value of `num` is now `ar[0]`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `ar`, and `same` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[0]`**.
