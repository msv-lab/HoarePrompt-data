To ensure that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of the variables that are part of the loop condition. The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` and `len(ar)` accordingly.

Given:
- `i` is 4 if `ar[i] == num` and 5 otherwise.
- `ar` is a list of integers with more than 3 elements.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`. Since `ar` has more than 3 elements, let's assume `len(ar) = m` where `m > 3`.

If `i` is 4, we need `4 < m`, which is true as `m > 3`.
If `i` is 5, we need `5 < m`, which is also true as `m > 3`.

Since the loop condition `i < len(ar)` is already satisfied given the constraints, no adjustment is needed for `i` or `len(ar)` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input and has more than 3 elements; `minn` is 1; `i` is 4 if `ar[i] == num` and 5 otherwise; `same` is 2 if `ar[i] == num` and 1 otherwise; `num` is `ar[2]` if `ar[i] == num` and `ar[4]` otherwise**.
