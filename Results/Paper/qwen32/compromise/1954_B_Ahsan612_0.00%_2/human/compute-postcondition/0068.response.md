The code snippet `num = ar[i]` assigns the value of `ar[i]` to `num`. Given the initial state, `i` is either 5 or 6, depending on whether `ar[i] == num` initially. However, since `num` is being redefined by `ar[i]`, we need to consider the new value of `num` directly from `ar[i]`.

Let's break down the possible scenarios:
1. If `i` was initially 5, then `num` becomes `ar[5]`.
2. If `i` was initially 6, then `num` becomes `ar[6]`.

After this assignment, the value of `num` is directly `ar[i]`, and the values of `i` and `same` remain unchanged based on the provided conditions. The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `minn`, and the conditions for `i` and `same` stay the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input and has more than 3 elements; `minn` is 1; `i` is 5 if `ar[i] == num` and 6 otherwise; `same` is 2 if `ar[i] == num` and 1 otherwise; `num` is `ar[i]`.**
