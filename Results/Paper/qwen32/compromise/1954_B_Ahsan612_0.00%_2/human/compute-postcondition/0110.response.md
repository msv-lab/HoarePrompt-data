Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input and must have at least `i + 2` elements; `i` is now `i + 1` and must be less than `len(ar) - 1`; `same` is 1; `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and 1; `num` is `ar[i]`.**

Natural Language: The variable `same` has been set to 1. The value of `minn` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and 1. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial state descriptions.
