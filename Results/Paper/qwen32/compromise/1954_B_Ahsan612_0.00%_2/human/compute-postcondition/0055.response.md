Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input and has at least 2 elements. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[2]`, `minn` is 1, and `i` is 2. In both cases, `ar[i]` does not equal `num` if `same` is 1.**
