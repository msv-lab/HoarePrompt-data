The task provides the initial state of several variables and a print statement. However, the print statement `print(-1)` does not depend on any of the variables `same`, `num`, `minn`, or `i` as they are not used in the statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The variable `same` is initialized to 1.
2. The variable `num` is initialized to 1.
3. The variable `minn` is initially set to 1 and then reassigned to infinity, so `minn` will be infinity.
4. The variable `i` is initialized to 6.
5. The print statement `print(-1)` is executed.

Since the print statement directly prints the integer `-1` and does not reference any of the variables, the output will be `-1`.

Output: **-1**
