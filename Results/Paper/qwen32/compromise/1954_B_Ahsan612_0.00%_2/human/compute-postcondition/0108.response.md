Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input and must have at least `i + 2` elements; `i` is now `i + 1` and must be less than `len(ar) - 1`; `same`, `minn` are updated as per the loop logic; `num` is `ar[i]`.**

In simple terms, the variable `num` is now assigned the value of the element at index `i` in the list `ar`. The other variables remain unchanged except for `num` which has been updated.
