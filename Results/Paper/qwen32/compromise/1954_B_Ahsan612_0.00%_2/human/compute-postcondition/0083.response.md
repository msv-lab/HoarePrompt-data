The code snippet `same = 1` sets the variable `same` to 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input; `same` is 1; `num` is the last unique number encountered in `ar`; `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`, where `minn` is `inf` if no valid minimum has been found yet; `i` is `len(ar)`**.
