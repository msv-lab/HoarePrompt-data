The value of `i` is updated to 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[0]`; `minn` is `inf`; `i` is 1**.
