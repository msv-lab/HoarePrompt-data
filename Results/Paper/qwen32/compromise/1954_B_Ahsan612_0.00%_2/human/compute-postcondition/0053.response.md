The code snippet updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value (`inf`) and the value of `same` (which is 1). Therefore, `minn` will be updated to 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[2]`; `minn` is 1; `i` is 2; `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`**.
