Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input and must have at least `i + 1` elements; `i` is `i + 2`; `same` is 2 if `ar[i-1]` equals `num` (i.e., `ar[0]`), otherwise `same` is 1 and `num` is updated to `ar[2]`; `minn` remains `inf` if `ar[i-1]` equals `num`, otherwise `minn` is updated to 1; `num` is `ar[i]`.**

Explanation: The value of `num` is updated to `ar[i]`. All other variables retain their previous values unless they were directly affected by the code.
