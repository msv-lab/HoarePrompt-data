The value of `num` is updated to be the first element of the list `ar`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input; `same` is 1; `num` is the first number in `ar`; `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and `same`; `i` is equal to the length of the new `ar`.
