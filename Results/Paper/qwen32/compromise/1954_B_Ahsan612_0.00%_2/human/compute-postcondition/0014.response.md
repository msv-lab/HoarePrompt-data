The code snippet provided is `same = 1`. This line of code reassigns the value of the variable `same` to 1. However, the initial state already specifies that `same` is 1. Therefore, the value of `same` does not change after the execution of this line.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `minn`, `i`, and the condition `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[2]`; `minn` is 1; `i` is 2; `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`**.
