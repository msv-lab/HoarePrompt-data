The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `-1`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, `minn`, `i`) and their relationships, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the `print(-1)` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. The variable `n` is a new input integer.
3. The variable `ar` is a new list of integers provided by the input.
4. The variable `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive numbers in `ar`.
5. The variable `num` is the last unique number encountered in `ar`.
6. The variable `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`, and it is currently set to `inf`.
7. The variable `i` is set to the length of the list `ar`.

Despite the detailed descriptions of these variables, the `print` statement does not use any of them. It directly prints the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
