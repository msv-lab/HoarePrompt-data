To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior and how it evolves with each iteration.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `same` is initialized to 1.
   - `num` is initialized to the first element of the array `ar`.
   - `minn` is initialized to `inf`.
   - `i` is initialized to 1.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates through the array `ar` starting from the second element (index 1).
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is the same as `num`, `same` is incremented.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is different from `num`, `minn` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `same`, then `same` is reset to 1, and `num` is updated to the current element `ar[i]`.
   - After the loop completes iterating through the array, `minn` is updated one last time to the minimum of its current value and `same`.

3. **Output**:
   - If `minn` is still `inf`, it means there was no sequence of consecutive numbers, and the output is `-1`.
   - Otherwise, the output is the value of `minn`.

### Output State After All Iterations:
- The variable `t` represents the number of test cases, and it is not affected by the loop body itself.
- For each test case, the variables `n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, `minn`, and `i` are re-initialized and computed based on the input for that test case.
- After processing all test cases, the only state that remains is the final output for each test case.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can generalize that:
- For each test case, `minn` will hold the minimum length of consecutive occurrences of any number in the array `ar`.
- If no such sequence exists (which is theoretically impossible given the problem constraints), `minn` would remain `inf`, but this would result in an output of `-1`.

### Final Output State:
Since the problem specifies that the array `a` is beautiful (implying it has at least one sequence of consecutive numbers), `minn` will always be a positive integer.

**Output State: **For each test case, the output will be the minimum length of consecutive occurrences of any number in the array `ar`.**

In natural language:
After all iterations, the output state is such that for each test case, the output will be the smallest number of consecutive occurrences of any single number in the input array `ar`. If no such sequence exists (which is not possible given the problem constraints), the output would be `-1`. However, since the array is guaranteed to be beautiful, the output will be a positive integer representing the minimum length of consecutive occurrences.
