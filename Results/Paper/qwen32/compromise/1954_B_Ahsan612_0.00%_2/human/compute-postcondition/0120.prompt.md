Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. The given array a is beautiful.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
    same = 1
    num = ar[0]
    minn = inf
    i = 1
    while i < len(ar):
        if ar[i] == num:
            same += 1
        else:
            i += 1
            num = ar[i]
            minn = min(minn, same)
            same = 1
        i += 1
    minn = min(minn, same)
    if minn == inf:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(minn)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers; `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of the last number in `ar` if it is the same as the previous one, otherwise 1; `num` is the last number in `ar`; `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and `same`; `i` is equal to the length of `ar`. If `minn` was `inf`, its value is unchanged. Otherwise, `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and `same`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input; `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive numbers in `ar`; `num` is the last unique number encountered in `ar`; `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`, where `minn` is `inf` if no valid minimum has been found yet; `i` is `len(ar)`. If `minn` was originally `inf`, it remains `inf`. Otherwise, `minn` holds the minimum value of the previous `minn` and `same`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `same` is 1; `num` is 1; `i` is 6; `minn` is either 1 or infinity. If `minn` equals infinity, then `minn` equals infinity. Otherwise, `minn` remains 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
