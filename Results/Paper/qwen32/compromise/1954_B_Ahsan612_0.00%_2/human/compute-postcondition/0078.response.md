To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the variables involved in the `print(minn)` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable is not directly used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this specific task.
2. **`n`**: A new input integer. This variable is also not directly used in the print statement.
3. **`ar`**: A new list of integers provided by the input. This list is crucial because it influences the values of `same`, `num`, and `minn`.
4. **`same`**: The count of the last sequence of consecutive numbers in `ar`. This variable keeps track of how many times the last unique number (`num`) appears consecutively at the end of the list.
5. **`num`**: The last unique number encountered in `ar`. This is the number that `same` is counting.
6. **`minn`**: The minimum value between the previous value of `minn` and `same`. Initially, `minn` is not equal to infinity, which means it has been updated at least once with a value from `same`.
7. **`i`**: The length of the list `ar`. This variable is not directly used in the print statement.

### Analysis of `minn`:
- `minn` is updated based on the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`.
- `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive numbers in `ar`.

### What is printed:
The `print(minn)` statement will print the value of `minn`, which is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact list `ar` and the values of `same` and `minn` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `minn`. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the value of `minn` as the minimum of the previous `minn` and the count of the last sequence of consecutive numbers in `ar`.

Output: **minn (where minn is the minimum of the previous minn and the count of the last sequence of consecutive numbers in ar)**
