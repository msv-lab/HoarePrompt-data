Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input and must have at least `i + 1` elements; `i` is incremented by 1; `same` is 3 if `ar[i]` equals `num` and was previously 2, otherwise `same` is 1; `num` is updated to `ar[i]` if `same` is 1, otherwise it remains `ar[2]`; `minn` remains `inf` if `ar[i]` equals `num` and was previously `inf`, otherwise `minn` is 1 if `ar[i-1]` equals `num` or `same` was 1, otherwise `minn` is 2.**

In simpler terms, the value of `i` is increased by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, and `minn` depend on the conditions specified in the initial state and the new value of `i`.
