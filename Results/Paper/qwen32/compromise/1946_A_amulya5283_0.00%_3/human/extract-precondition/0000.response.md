Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case consisting of an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list a of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
