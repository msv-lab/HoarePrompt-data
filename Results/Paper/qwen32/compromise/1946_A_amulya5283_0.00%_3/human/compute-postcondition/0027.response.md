Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, where each tuple represents a test case consisting of an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases` sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value of `arr[median_index]`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is: `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 10,000, `test_cases` remains a list of test cases, `results` remains a list containing the value of `operations`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is updated to the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is updated to the sorted list of integers from the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is updated to `n // 2`, and `current_median` is set to the value at the `median_index` in the sorted list `arr`.
