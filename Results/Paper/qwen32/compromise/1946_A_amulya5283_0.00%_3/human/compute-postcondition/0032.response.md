The provided Python code snippet uses `heapq.heappop(heap)` to remove and return the smallest element from the heap. This operation modifies the `heap` by removing the smallest element and adjusts the heap structure accordingly.

Given the initial state, the heap is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]`. After executing `heapq.heappop(heap)`, the smallest element from this heap is removed, and the heap is restructured to maintain the heap property.

Here's the updated state:

- `smallest` is assigned the value of the smallest element in the heap.
- The `heap` is modified to no longer include the `smallest` element and is restructured to maintain the heap property.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, where each tuple represents a test case consisting of an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `results` is a list containing the value 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases` and `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases` sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value of `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed, `operations` is 0, `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from the heap.**
