The code snippet provided increments the variable `operations` by 1. The previous value of `operations` is 2, so after the execution, `operations` will be 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, `results` is a list containing the value 0 and the value of `operations`, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value of `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and `smallest + 1` added such that `heap[0] <= current_median`, `operations` is 3, `smallest` is the element that was previously the smallest in `heap` and has now been removed from it.**
