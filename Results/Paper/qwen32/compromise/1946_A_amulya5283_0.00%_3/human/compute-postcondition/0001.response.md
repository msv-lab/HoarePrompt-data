The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, which ensures that the loop will execute. The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be set before the loop starts since it is initialized by the `range` function.

The `test_cases` list and `results` list are not part of the loop head, so we do not need to adjust their states for the loop to execute. However, for the loop to be meaningful, `test_cases` should have `t` number of test cases, and `results` should be initialized as an empty list, which it already is.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, where each tuple represents a test case consisting of an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `results` is an empty list, `i` is not set before the loop starts**
