The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. This action does not affect the values of `t` or `test_cases`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case consisting of an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list a of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `results` is an empty list.**
