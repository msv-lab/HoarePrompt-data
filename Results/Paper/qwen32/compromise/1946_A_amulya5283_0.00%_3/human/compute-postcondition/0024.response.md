The code snippet assigns the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases` to `n` and the second element (which is a list) to `arr`. The variable `i` is then incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, where each tuple represents a test case consisting of an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`.**
