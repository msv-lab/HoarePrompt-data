The code snippet provided is:

```python
current_median = arr[median_index]
```

This line of code reassigns the value of `current_median` to the value of `arr[median_index]`. Since `median_index` is defined as `n // 2` and `arr` is the sorted second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr[median_index]` is the median value of the sorted list `arr`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `current_median`. All other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, `results` is a list containing the value 0 and the value of `operations`, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value of `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` where all elements are greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the total number of operations performed.**
