The code snippet `a[-1] -= 1` modifies the last element of the list `array` by subtracting 1 from it. Given the initial state, the last element of `array` is `n`, so after the operation, the last element becomes `n - 1`.

All other variables retain their initial values. `n` and `k` are integers with the constraints 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and `k` is even. `i` is `n`, and `answer` is a list containing the integer `n`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `k` is even; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, with the last element being `n - 1`; `i` is `n`; `answer` is a list containing the integer `n`.**
