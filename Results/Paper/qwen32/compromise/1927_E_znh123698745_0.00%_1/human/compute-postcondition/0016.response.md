The code snippet `answer.append(array[a[0]])` appends the element at the index `a[0]` of the `array` to the `answer` list. However, the initial state does not specify what `a` is, so we can only assume that `a` is a list or array that has been defined elsewhere in the program and that `a[0]` is a valid index for `array`.

Given that `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, and assuming `a[0]` is a valid index (i.e., `0 <= a[0] < n`), the value appended to `answer` will be `array[a[0]]`, which is an integer from 1 to `n`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `array`, `i`) remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `k` is even; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive; `i` is `n`; `answer` has an additional element which is `array[a[0]]`.**
