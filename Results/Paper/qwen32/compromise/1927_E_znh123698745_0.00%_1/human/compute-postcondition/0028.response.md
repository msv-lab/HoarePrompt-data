Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `answer` is a list containing the sequence `[1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ..., k/2, n-k/2+1]` if `n` is even, or a similar alternating pattern adjusted for odd `n`. `a` is `[n//2 + 1, -n//2]` if `n` is even, or a similar adjusted state if `n` is odd.**

Explanation: The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the integers provided by the input. The values of `answer` and `a` remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
