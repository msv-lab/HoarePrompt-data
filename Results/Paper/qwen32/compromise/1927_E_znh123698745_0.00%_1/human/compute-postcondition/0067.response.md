The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value less than `n`, and `n` must be greater than 1. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that the loop starts with `i` at 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`, if `i` was 1 at the start of the previous iteration, it would be 2 at the start of the current iteration. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be 2 more than its initial value, and `n` must still be greater than the current value of `i`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 2**
