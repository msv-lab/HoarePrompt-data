The code `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of the list `a` by 1. Therefore, the value of `a[-1]` will be reduced by 1. The other variables `n`, `k`, `i`, and `answer` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `k` is an input integer, `i` is 4, `answer` contains the element `array[a[-1]]` appended to it, `a[-1]` is decremented by 1.**
