The code snippet provided attempts to append an element from `array` to the `answer` list, using `a[0]` as the index. However, the initial state does not mention the existence of `array` or `a`. Given the information provided, we can only assume that `array` and `a` are defined elsewhere in the program, and `a[0]` is a valid index for `array`.

Given the initial state, the value of `answer` is a list containing the integer `3`. After executing the line `answer.append(array[a[0]])`, the `answer` list will have an additional element, which is `array[a[0]]`.

Since the specific values of `array` and `a[0]` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact new value of `answer`. However, we can describe the state after the code execution.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `k` is an input integer, `i` is 3, `answer` contains the integers 3 and `array[a[0]]`.**
