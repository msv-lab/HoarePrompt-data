Postcondition: **`t` remains unchanged, `s` is the input string that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is 2, `q` is incremented by 1. If `int(s[i])` is not equal to `int(s[i + 1])`, `count` is incremented by 1 and `flag` is adjusted based on the condition `int(s[i])` compared to `int(s[i + 1])`. If `int(s[i])` is equal to `int(s[i + 1])`, `count` and `flag` remain unchanged.**
