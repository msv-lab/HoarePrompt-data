Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `s` is a string of length between 2 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `i` is `i + 1`. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, `count` is incremented by 1. If `s[i]` is less than `s[i + 1]`, `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged.**
