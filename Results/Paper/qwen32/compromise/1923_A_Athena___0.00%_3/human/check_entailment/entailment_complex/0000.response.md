### Reasoning:

The provided Python function is intended to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of operations required to move chips into a single contiguous block. The function processes each test case by reading the number of cells `n` and the list of cells `a` which contains `0`s (free cells) and `1`s (occupied cells with chips).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the function's logic:

1. **Input Reading**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. **List Processing**: For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list `a` of `n` integers.
3. **Trimming Leading and Trailing Zeros**: The function removes any leading and trailing zeros from the list `a`. This is done using two while loops:
   - The first loop removes zeros from the beginning of the list.
   - The second loop removes zeros from the end of the list.
4. **Counting Internal Zeros**: After trimming, the function counts the number of zeros in the remaining list `a`. This count represents the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block. The reasoning is that each zero in the trimmed list represents a gap that needs to be filled by moving a chip into that position.
5. **Output**: The function prints the count of zeros for each test case.

### Analysis:

The approach of removing leading and trailing zeros and counting the remaining zeros is correct because:
- Removing leading and trailing zeros ensures that we only consider the segment of the ribbon that contains chips.
- Counting the zeros in this segment gives the number of gaps between chips that need to be filled, which directly corresponds to the minimum number of operations required.

### Conclusion:

The logic of the function matches the problem's requirements and correctly computes the minimum number of operations for each test case. Therefore, the function is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
