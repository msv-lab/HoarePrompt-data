`n` is reassigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `t`, `a`, and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 999; `n` is the newly input integer; `a` is a list; `res` is the number of 0s in the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 999; `n` is the newly input integer; `a` is a list; `res` is the number of 0s in the list `a`.**
