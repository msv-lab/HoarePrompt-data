Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an empty list `[]`.
- `res` is an integer with a value of `0`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a)
```

### Analysis:
The print statement `print(a)` will output the current value of the variable `a`. According to the initial state, `a` is explicitly defined as an empty list `[]`.

### Output:
The code will print the empty list `[]`.

Output: **[]**
