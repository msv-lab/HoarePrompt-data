The code snippet `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Given the initial state, the first element of `a` is 0. After executing the code, the list `a` will no longer contain this first element, but all other elements will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 999, `n` is the newly input integer, `a` has at least one element (the original second element becomes the new first element), `res` is 0.**
