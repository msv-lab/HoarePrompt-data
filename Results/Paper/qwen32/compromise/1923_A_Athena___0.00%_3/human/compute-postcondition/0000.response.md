The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Given that `t` was initially described as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, after executing this line, `t` will hold the value of the integer input. The other variables (`n`, the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is either 0 or 1. There is at least one `a_i` equal to 1 in each test case.**
