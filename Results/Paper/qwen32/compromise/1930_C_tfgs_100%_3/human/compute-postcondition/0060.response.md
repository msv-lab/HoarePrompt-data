The code snippet `cur += counter[a[i]]` increments the value of `cur` by the count of the current element `a[i]` in the `counter` object. This means that the running sum `cur` is updated to include the frequency of the current element in the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least one element, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the updated list `a` with the count of `a[i]` decremented by 1 for each processed element, `cur` is the running sum of the decremented counts of the elements in `a` minus `adv` plus `counter[a[i]]`, `cnt` is recalculated as `cnt - adv` if `i > 0`, `ans` is a list containing all the accumulated values based on the condition and the value of `adv` with the new element `a[i]` appended, `i` is `i + 1`, and `adv` is 0 if `i > 0`. The count of `a[i]` in `counter` is decreased by 1. `cur` is now `cur + counter[a[i]]`.**
