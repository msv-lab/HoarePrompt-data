The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns this list of integers to the variable `a`. This means that the initial value of `a` (which was described as a list of `n` integers) is now specifically assigned based on the input provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10⁹; The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10⁵.**
