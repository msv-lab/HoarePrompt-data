The code snippet `a = list(set(a))` converts the list `a` to a set to remove any duplicate elements and then converts it back to a list. This operation changes the list `a` by removing any duplicate values, but it does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `counter`, or `cur`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` is unique and was originally `a_i + (i + 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`; `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the updated list `a`; `cur` is 0.**
