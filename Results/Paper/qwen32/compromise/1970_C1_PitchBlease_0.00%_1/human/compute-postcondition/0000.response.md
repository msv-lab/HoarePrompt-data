The provided code snippet initializes a `deque` named `queue` with a single tuple `(start, 0)`. This tuple represents the starting node and the initial distance or level (which is 0 in this case) from the start node.

The initial state specifies that `start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, and `tree` is a data structure (either a dictionary or a list of lists) that contains the neighbors of each node. These variables are not directly modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree such that 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree; `tree` is a dictionary (or list of lists) where `tree[i]` contains the neighbors of node i; `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)` representing the starting node and the initial distance of 0.**
