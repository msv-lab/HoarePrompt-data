The code snippet initializes a set named `visited` and adds the `start` node to it. This means that the `start` node is now marked as visited. The values of `start`, `target`, `tree`, and `queue` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree such that 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree; `tree` is a dictionary (or list of lists) where `tree[i]` contains the neighbors of node i; `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)` representing the starting node and the initial distance of 0; `visited` is a set containing the `start` node.**
