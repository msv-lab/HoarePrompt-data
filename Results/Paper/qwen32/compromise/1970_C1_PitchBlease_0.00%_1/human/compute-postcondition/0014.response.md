Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree such that 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n; `tree` is a dictionary where `tree[i]` contains the neighbors of node i, and `tree[start]` must contain at least one neighbor; `queue` is a deque that now contains the previous elements plus a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`; `visited` is a set containing the `start` node, `current` node, and possibly other nodes, including `neighbor`; `current` is equal to `start` or another node in the tree; `dist` is a non-negative integer representing the distance from `start` to `current`; `neighbor` is the next neighbor of `current` in the list of neighbors of `current` that has not yet been processed; `current` is not equal to `target`.**

In simple terms, the `queue` now includes a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, which means the neighbor node and the incremented distance from the start node have been added to the queue. Other variables remain unchanged.
