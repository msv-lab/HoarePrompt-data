Postcondition: **`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree such that 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree; `tree` is a dictionary (or list of lists) where `tree[i]` contains the neighbors of node i; `queue` is a deque that is now empty or contains remaining tuples after removing the first one; `visited` is a set containing the `start` node; `current` is equal to `target`; `dist` is 0; and `current` is equal to `target`.**
