The code appends a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` to the `queue`. This means that the `queue` now contains the additional element `(neighbor, dist + 1)`. The values of `start`, `target`, `tree`, `visited`, `current`, and `dist` remain unchanged. The `neighbor` is not in `visited`, and the condition `if current equals target` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree such that 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n; `tree` is a dictionary where `tree[i]` contains the neighbors of node i and `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor; `queue` is a deque that contains all previous elements plus `(neighbor, dist + 1)`; `visited` is a set containing all nodes that are reachable from `start` including `next_node` and `neighbor`; `current` is `next_node`. If `current` equals `target`, the program returns `dist`, which is the next value in the deque after `next_node`. Otherwise, no return value is specified and the state of `dist` remains as the next value in the deque after `next_node`. Additionally, `neighbor` is not in `visited`.**
