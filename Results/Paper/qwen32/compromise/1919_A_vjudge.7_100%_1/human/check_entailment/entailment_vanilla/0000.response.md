To determine if the given Python program is correct, we need to analyze the logic and see if it aligns with the problem's requirements.

The game revolves around the total number of coins (a + b) that Alice and Bob have combined. The key observation here is that the game's outcome depends on whether the total number of coins is odd or even.

Here's the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Initial State**: Alice starts the game with `a` coins, and Bob starts with `b` coins. The total number of coins is `a + b`.

2. **Turns and Moves**: Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet, and then they must remove one coin from the wallet they are currently using. The game continues until one player can't make a valid move (i.e., when both wallets are empty).

3. **Winning Strategy**:
   - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is even, the second player (Bob) can always mirror the first player's (Alice's) moves, ensuring that he always has a valid move until the end. This is because the game will end when the last coin is taken, and since the total number of coins is even, Bob will take the last coin and win.
   - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is odd, the first player (Alice) can always make the last move, ensuring that she wins. This is because the game will end when the last coin is taken, and since the total number of coins is odd, Alice will take the last coin and win.

4. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets (`a` and `b`).
   - It checks if the sum of coins (`a + b`) is even or odd using the bitwise AND operation (`a + b & 1`). If the result is `0`, the sum is even; otherwise, it's odd.
   - It prints "Bob" if the sum is even and "Alice" if the sum is odd.

The program correctly implements the logic described above. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
