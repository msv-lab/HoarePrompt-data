### Reasoning:
The game can be analyzed based on the total number of coins (a + b) in both wallets. The key observation is that the game's outcome depends on whether the total number of coins is even or odd.

1. **Even Total Coins (a + b is even):**
   - If the total number of coins is even, Bob will always win if both players play optimally.
   - This is because Alice will always be the one to face the situation where the total number of coins is odd on her turn, and Bob will always face an even total on his turn.
   - When the total number of coins is 2, Bob will win because Alice cannot make a move after reducing the total to 1.
   - This pattern continues for higher even totals.

2. **Odd Total Coins (a + b is odd):**
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will always win if both players play optimally.
   - Alice will always be the one to face the situation where the total number of coins is even on her turn, and Bob will always face an odd total on his turn.
   - When the total number of coins is 1, Alice will win because Bob cannot make a move.
   - This pattern continues for higher odd totals.

The provided code snippet correctly implements this logic by checking if the sum of the coins (a + b) is even or odd using the bitwise AND operation (`a + b & 1`). If the result is 0, the sum is even, and Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

### Correctness:
The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
