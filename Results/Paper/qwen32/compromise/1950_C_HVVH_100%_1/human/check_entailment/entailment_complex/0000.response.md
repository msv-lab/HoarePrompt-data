### Reasoning:

The provided Python function is designed to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format, appending "AM" or "PM" as appropriate. Let's analyze the function step-by-step to ensure it correctly handles all edge cases and test scenarios as described in the problem statement:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` in the format "hh:mm".

2. **Conversion Logic:**
   - The function splits the string `s` into `h` (hours) and `m` (minutes) using `map(int, input().split(':'))`.
   - It then applies the following logic to convert the hours:
     - If `h == 0`, it sets `h` to `12` and `day` to `'AM'`. This correctly handles midnight (00:00).
     - If `h > 12`, it subtracts `12` from `h` and sets `day` to `'PM'`. This correctly converts PM hours.
     - If `h` is between `1` and `12`, it sets `day` to `'AM'` unless `h == 12`, in which case it sets `day` to `'PM'`. This correctly handles noon (12:00).

3. **Output:**
   - The function prints the converted time in the format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM", ensuring that `h` and `m` are zero-padded to two digits using `f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}'`.

### Edge Cases:
- **Midnight (00:00):** Should be converted to "12:00 AM".
- **Noon (12:00):** Should be converted to "12:00 PM".
- **AM hours (01:00 to 11:59):** Should be correctly printed with "AM".
- **PM hours (13:00 to 23:59):** Should be correctly converted and printed with "PM".

### Conclusion:
The function correctly handles all the input cases and edge cases as specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the function is correct.

### Your Response:
Reasoning: The function correctly handles all input cases and edge cases, converting times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and appending the appropriate AM or PM designation.
Correctness: **True**
