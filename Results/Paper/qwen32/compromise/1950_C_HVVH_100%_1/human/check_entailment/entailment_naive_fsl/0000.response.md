Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the hour is exactly 12 PM correctly. Specifically, when the input is `12:00`, the program should output `12:00 PM`, but it outputs `00:00 PM` instead. This is because the code sets `h = 12` and `day = 'AM'` when `h == 0`, but it does not handle the case when `h == 12` to set `day = 'PM'` correctly.

Here is the problematic part of the code:
```python
if h == 0:
    h = 12
    day = 'AM'
elif h > 12:
    h = h - 12
    day = 'PM'
else:
    day = 'AM'
    if h == 12:
        day = 'PM'
```

The issue arises because the `else` block is executed for `h == 12`, but it sets `day = 'AM'` first and then checks if `h == 12` to set `day = 'PM'`. However, the `day = 'AM'` assignment is not necessary and causes the incorrect output for `12:00`.

To fix this, the code should be adjusted to handle the `h == 12` case correctly:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

With this correction, the program will correctly output `12:00 PM` for the input `12:00`.
