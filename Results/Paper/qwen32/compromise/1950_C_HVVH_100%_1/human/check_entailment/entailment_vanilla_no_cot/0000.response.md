Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the incorrect handling of the AM/PM designation when the hour is 12. Specifically, the program sets the day to 'AM' when the hour is 0 (which is correct), but it does not handle the case where the hour is 12 correctly. When the hour is 12, it should be 'PM', but the program sets it to 'AM' in the `else` block. Here's the corrected version of the relevant part of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
            if h == 12:
                day = 'PM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

However, the `else` block can be simplified to avoid the issue:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

Alternatively, you can simplify the logic further by handling the 12-hour conversion and AM/PM designation in a more streamlined way:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)

# This can be simplified to:

def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        day = 'AM' if h < 12 else 'PM'
        h = h % 12
        h = 12 if h == 0 else h
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

In the simplified version, `h % 12` handles the conversion to 12-hour format, and `h = 12 if h == 0 else h` ensures that 00:00 becomes 12:00 AM.
