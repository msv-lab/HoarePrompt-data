You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, m is an integer representing the number of edges in the graph such that 3 <= n <= m <= min((n*(n - 1))/2, 2 * 10^5).
def func_6():
    n, m = func_3()
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    edges = []
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, w = func_3()
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
        graph[v].append(u)
        
        edges.append((w, u, v))
        
    #State: `n` and `m` remain the values returned by `func_3()`, `graph` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing `m` edges represented as adjacency lists, and `edges` is a list of `m` tuples, each containing a weight `w` and the vertices `u` and `v` of an edge.
    edges.sort(reverse=True)
    dsu = DSU(n + 1)
    _min_edge = float('inf')
    node_u = -1
    node_v = -1
    for (w, u, v) in edges:
        parent_u = dsu.find(u)
        
        parent_v = dsu.find(v)
        
        if parent_u == parent_v:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
            if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge:
                _min_edge = dsu.min_edge[parent_u]
                node_u = u
                node_v = v
        else:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
        
    #State: `n` and `m` remain the values returned by `func_3()`, `graph` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing `m` edges represented as adjacency lists, `edges` is a list of `m` tuples, each containing a weight `w` and the vertices `u` and `v` of an edge, sorted in descending order by weight `w`, then by vertex `u`, and finally by vertex `v`, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n + 1` elements reflecting the connected components after processing all edges, `_min_edge` is the minimum weight of an edge found among the edges that connect vertices already in the same set, `node_u` is the first vertex of the edge with the minimum weight found among the edges that connect vertices already in the same set, `node_v` is the second vertex of the edge with the minimum weight found among the edges that connect vertices already in the same set.
    colors = [0] * (n + 1)
    res = dfs(node_u, -1, [])
    print(_min_edge, len(res))
    #This is printed: _min_edge, len(res) (where _min_edge is the minimum weight of an edge connecting vertices already in the same set, and res is the result of the dfs function starting from node_u)
    print(*res)
    #This is printed: res (where res is the result of the dfs function starting from node_u)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_6` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in a graph and `m` is an integer representing the number of edges in the graph. The constraints are that `n` must be between 3 and `m`, and `m` must be between `n` and the minimum of `(n*(n - 1))/2` and `2 * 10^5`. The function returns an unspecified output based on these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
