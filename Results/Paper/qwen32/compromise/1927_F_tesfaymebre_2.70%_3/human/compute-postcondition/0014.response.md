To determine what will be printed by the `print(_min_edge, len(res))` statement, let's break down the relevant parts of the initial state provided:

1. **_min_edge**: This variable holds the minimum weight of an edge found among the edges that connect vertices already in the same set. This implies that during the processing of the edges, some edges were found where both vertices were already part of the same connected component in the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure. The weight of the smallest such edge is stored in `_min_edge`.

2. **res**: This variable holds the result of the `dfs(node_u, -1, [])` function call, where `node_u` is the first vertex of the edge with the minimum weight found among the edges that connect vertices already in the same set. The `dfs` function likely performs a depth-first search starting from `node_u` and returns some result, which is stored in `res`. The length of `res` will depend on what the `dfs` function returns.

Given the initial state, we can describe the output as follows:

- `_min_edge` is the minimum weight of an edge that connects vertices already in the same connected component.
- `len(res)` is the length of the result returned by the `dfs` function starting from `node_u`.

Since the exact values of `_min_edge` and `res` cannot be determined without more specific information about the graph, the edges, and the behavior of the `dfs` function, we describe them in terms of their definitions.

Output: **_min_edge, len(res) (where _min_edge is the minimum weight of an edge connecting vertices already in the same set, and res is the result of the dfs function starting from node_u)**
