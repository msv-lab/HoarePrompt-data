The function `func_6` constructs a graph from a given number of vertices `n` and edges `m`, processes the edges to find a minimum-weight edge that connects vertices already in the same connected component, and then performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from one of the vertices of this edge. It prints the weight of this edge and the number of vertices visited during the DFS, followed by the list of visited vertices.
