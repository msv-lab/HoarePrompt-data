Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Graph Representation and DFS Context**: The `graph` variable used in the `dfs` function is not defined within its scope, leading to a `NameError`. The `graph` should be passed as a parameter to the `dfs` function.

2. **Cycle Detection Logic**: The `dfs` function is supposed to detect a cycle starting from `node_u` and ending at `node_v` (the edge that completes the cycle), but the logic for identifying the cycle's start and end points is flawed. The current implementation checks if `node_v` is in the path, but it does not correctly handle the cycle detection and traversal order.

3. **DSU (Disjoint Set Union) Implementation**: The `DSU` class is not defined in the provided code, which is crucial for finding cycles in the graph by checking if an edge connects two vertices that are already in the same set.

4. **Union Operation in DSU**: The `union` method in the `DSU` class should not only union the sets but also keep track of the minimum edge weight in each set, which is not implemented.

5. **Cycle Extraction**: After finding the edge that completes the cycle (the edge with the minimum weight in the cycle), the program needs to correctly extract the cycle from the graph, which is not handled properly in the current implementation.

6. **Edge Sorting**: The edges are sorted in descending order, but the logic for finding the cycle should consider the smallest weight edge first, so the sorting should be in ascending order.

To correct the program, the following steps need to be taken:

- Define the `DSU` class with proper union and find operations, including tracking the minimum edge weight.
- Pass the `graph` variable to the `dfs` function.
- Correct the logic for cycle detection and extraction.
- Sort the edges in ascending order of their weights.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import sys
import threading

class DSU:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.parent = list(range(n))
        self.rank = [0] * n
        self.min_edge = [float('inf')] * n

    def find(self, u):
        if self.parent[u] != u:
            self.parent[u] = self.find(self.parent[u])
        return self.parent[u]

    def union(self, u, v, w):
        root_u = self.find(u)
        root_v = self.find(v)
        if root_u != root_v:
            if self.rank[root_u] > self.rank[root_v]:
                self.parent[root_v] = root_u
            elif self.rank[root_u] < self.rank[root_v]:
                self.parent[root_u] = root_v
            else:
                self.parent[root_v] = root_u
                self.rank[root_u] += 1
            self.min_edge[root_u] = min(self.min_edge[root_u], w)
            self.min_edge[root_v] = min(self.min_edge[root_v], w)
        else:
            self.min_edge[root_u] = min(self.min_edge[root_u], w)

def dfs(curr, parent, path, graph, target):
    if curr == target:
        return path + [curr]
    for nei in graph[curr]:
        if nei != parent:
            res = dfs(nei, curr, path + [curr], graph, target)
            if res:
                return res
    return None

def solve():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    edges = []
    for _ in range(m):
        (u, v, w) = map(int, input().split())
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)
        edges.append((w, u, v))
    edges.sort()
    dsu = DSU(n + 1)
    _min_edge = float('inf')
    node_u = -1
    node_v = -1
    for (w, u, v) in edges:
        parent_u = dsu.find(u)
        parent_v = dsu.find(v)
        if parent_u == parent_v:
            if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge:
                _min_edge = dsu.min_edge[parent_u]
                node_u = u
                node_v = v
        else:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
    cycle = dfs(node_u, -1, [], graph, node_v)
    print(_min_edge, len(cycle))
    print(*cycle)

def main():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        solve()

threading.Thread(target=main).start()
```

This corrected version should properly solve the problem as described.
