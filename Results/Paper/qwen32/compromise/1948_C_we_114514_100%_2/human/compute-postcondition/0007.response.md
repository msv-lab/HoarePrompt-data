Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from the input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n` containing only the characters '<' and '>'. For each test case, it computes a result using the function `func_1` and stores these results. Finally, it prints each result on a new line.**
