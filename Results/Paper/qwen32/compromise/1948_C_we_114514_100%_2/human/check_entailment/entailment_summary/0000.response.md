### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the given functions to determine if the solution is correct.

#### Problem Analysis:
The robot starts at position (1,1) and needs to reach (2,n). The robot can move in four directions (up, down, left, right) but can only move along the arrow direction after each move.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Movement Constraints**: The robot must be able to navigate through the grid in such a way that it can reach (2,n) without encountering obstacles.
2. **Arrow Directions**: The arrows in the grid dictate the direction the robot must move after each free move.
3. **Grid Structure**: The grid is 2 rows by n columns, and the robot can only move within the grid boundaries.

#### Function Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**: This function checks specific conditions to determine if the robot can reach (2,n).
  - It checks if there are any patterns of arrows that would prevent the robot from reaching the target.
  - Specifically, it looks for sequences of arrows that would trap the robot or prevent it from moving to the next column.
- **Function `func_2`**: This function reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

#### Detailed Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Half_n Calculation**: The variable `half_n` is calculated as `n // 2`, which is used to iterate through the grid.
- **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates through the grid up to `half_n - 1`. This loop checks for specific patterns of arrows that would prevent the robot from reaching the target.
  - The condition `if row1[2 * i + 1] == '<' and (row2[2 * i] == '<' or row2[2 * i + 2] == '<')` checks if there are two consecutive '<' arrows in `row1` and a '<' arrow in either of the adjacent positions in `row2`. If this condition is met, it returns 'No'.
- **Final Condition**: After the loop, the function checks if the last arrow in `row1` points left and the second last arrow in `row2` points left. If both are true, it returns 'No'.
- **Return 'Yes'**: If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns 'Yes'.

#### Validation Against Examples:
- **First Example**: The robot can reach (2,4) because there are no sequences of arrows that would trap it.
- **Second Example**: The robot can reach (2,2) because there are no sequences of arrows that would trap it.
- **Third Example**: The robot cannot reach (2,4) because the conditions in `func_1` are met.
- **Fourth Example**: The robot can reach (2,6) because there are no sequences of arrows that would trap it.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine if the robot can reach (2,n) based on the given constraints. `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and uses `func_1` to determine the results.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
