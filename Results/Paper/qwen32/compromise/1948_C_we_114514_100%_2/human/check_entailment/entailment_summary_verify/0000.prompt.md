You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Output

    YES
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, row1, row2):
    """
    判断机器人是否能够从 (1,1) 到达 (2,n)。
    """
    half_n = n // 2
    for i in range(half_n - 1):
        if row1[2 * i + 1] == '<' and (row2[2 * i] == '<' or row2[2 * i + 2] == '<'):
            return 'No'
    if row1[n - 1] == '<' and row2[n - 2] == '<':

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from the input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n` containing only the characters '<' and '>'. For each test case, it computes a result using the function `func_1` and stores these results. Finally, it prints each result on a new line.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases for determining whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n). Let's analyze the logic in `func_1` to see why it is incorrect.

### Analysis of `func_1`

The function `func_1` makes several assumptions about the structure of the grid that may not hold true for all cases. Specifically, it checks for certain patterns in the grid but does not fully simulate the robot's movement according to the rules given in the problem description.

Here are the key issues with `func_1`:

1. **Pattern Checking**:
   - The function checks for specific patterns in the grid, such as `row1[2 * i + 1] == '<'` and `(row2[2 * i] == '<' or row2[2 * i + 2] == '<')`. This pattern checking does not cover all possible scenarios where the robot can or cannot reach the target cell.
   - The function also checks the last two columns for a specific pattern, but this is not sufficient to cover all cases.

2. **No Simulation of Movement**:
   - The function does not simulate the robot's movement step-by-step according to the rules specified in the problem description. It does not consider all possible paths the robot can take.
   - The robot can move left, right, down, or up, and then follow the arrow in the current cell. The function does not account for all these possible moves.

### Counterexample

Let's consider a counterexample where the function `func_1` will fail:

**Input:**
```
1
6
><><><
><><><
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- The robot can start at (1, 1) and follow the pattern of moves:
  - (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (1, 3) -> (1, 4) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 5) -> (1, 5) -> (1, 6) -> (2, 6)
- Therefore, the robot can reach the cell (2, 6).

**Actual Output of `func_1`:**
- The function will likely return 'No' for this input because it does not correctly handle the alternating pattern of arrows.

### Conclusion

Since the function `func_1` does not correctly simulate the robot's movement and does not handle all possible scenarios, it is incorrect. The provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
