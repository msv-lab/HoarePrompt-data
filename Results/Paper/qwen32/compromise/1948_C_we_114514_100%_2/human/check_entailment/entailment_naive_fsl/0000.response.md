Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases for determining whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n). Let's analyze the logic in `func_1` to see why it is incorrect.

### Analysis of `func_1`

The function `func_1` makes several assumptions about the structure of the grid that may not hold true for all cases. Specifically, it checks for certain patterns in the grid but does not fully simulate the robot's movement according to the rules given in the problem description.

Here are the key issues with `func_1`:

1. **Pattern Checking**:
   - The function checks for specific patterns in the grid, such as `row1[2 * i + 1] == '<'` and `(row2[2 * i] == '<' or row2[2 * i + 2] == '<')`. This pattern checking does not cover all possible scenarios where the robot can or cannot reach the target cell.
   - The function also checks the last two columns for a specific pattern, but this is not sufficient to cover all cases.

2. **No Simulation of Movement**:
   - The function does not simulate the robot's movement step-by-step according to the rules specified in the problem description. It does not consider all possible paths the robot can take.
   - The robot can move left, right, down, or up, and then follow the arrow in the current cell. The function does not account for all these possible moves.

### Counterexample

Let's consider a counterexample where the function `func_1` will fail:

**Input:**
```
1
6
><><><
><><><
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- The robot can start at (1, 1) and follow the pattern of moves:
  - (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (1, 3) -> (1, 4) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 5) -> (1, 5) -> (1, 6) -> (2, 6)
- Therefore, the robot can reach the cell (2, 6).

**Actual Output of `func_1`:**
- The function will likely return 'No' for this input because it does not correctly handle the alternating pattern of arrows.

### Conclusion

Since the function `func_1` does not correctly simulate the robot's movement and does not handle all possible scenarios, it is incorrect. The provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
