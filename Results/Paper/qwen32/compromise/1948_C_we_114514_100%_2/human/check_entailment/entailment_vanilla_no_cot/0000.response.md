Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) for all possible configurations of the grid. The logic in `func_1` is too simplistic and does not account for all possible paths the robot can take based on the arrows in the grid. The robot can move in four directions (left, right, up, down) and then follow the arrow in the current cell, which means the robot's movement is more complex than just checking specific patterns in the grid.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the robot's movements based on the arrows in the grid, taking into account all possible moves (left, right, up, down) and ensuring that the robot does not go out of bounds. This requires a more comprehensive approach, such as using a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) to explore all possible paths from the starting cell (1, 1) to the target cell (2, n).

Here is a possible correct implementation using BFS:

```python
from collections import deque

def can_reach_target(n, row1, row2):
    # Directions: (row_change, col_change)
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # up, down, left, right
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([(1, 1)])  # Starting point (1, 1)

    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        if (r, c) == (2, n):
            return 'YES'
        if (r, c) in visited:
            continue
        visited.add((r, c))
        
        # Move in all four directions
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 1 <= nr <= 2 and 1 <= nc <= n:
                # Move along the arrow
                if nr == 1:
                    if row1[nc - 1] == '>':
                        queue.append((1, nc + 1))
                    elif row1[nc - 1] == '<':
                        queue.append((1, nc - 1))
                elif nr == 2:
                    if row2[nc - 1] == '>':
                        queue.append((2, nc + 1))
                    elif row2[nc - 1] == '<':
                        queue.append((2, nc - 1))
    
    return 'NO'

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        row1 = input()
        row2 = input()
        results.append(can_reach_target(n, row1, row2))
    print('\n'.join(results))

# Example usage:
# func_2()
```

This implementation uses BFS to explore all possible paths from the starting cell (1, 1) to the target cell (2, n), taking into account the arrows in the grid and ensuring the robot does not go out of bounds.
