To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic used to determine the winner of the game.

The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing a coin from their current wallet. They can also choose to swap wallets before removing a coin. The player who cannot make a move loses. Both players play optimally.

The key to solving this problem lies in the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins (a + b). Here's the reasoning:

1. If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, the second player (Bob) can always mirror the first player's (Alice's) moves. For example, if Alice swaps, Bob swaps; if Alice takes a coin, Bob takes a coin. This mirroring strategy ensures that Bob will always be able to make a move as long as Alice can. Therefore, if the total number of coins is even, Bob will win.

2. If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, the first player (Alice) can always ensure that she leaves an even number of coins for Bob. By doing this, Alice forces Bob into a position where he will eventually be unable to make a move. Therefore, if the total number of coins is odd, Alice will win.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the sum of coins (a + b) and printing 'Bob' if the sum is even and 'Alice' if the sum is odd.

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
