### Reasoning:
The problem can be analyzed using the concept of game theory, particularly the concept of Nim-sum (or XOR-sum) in combinatorial game theory. However, in this specific problem, the optimal strategy can be deduced more directly:

1. **Odd Sum of Coins**: If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, Alice can always ensure that Bob is left with an even sum of coins after her turn. Since Bob will then be forced to make a move that results in an odd sum again, Alice can always respond in a way that keeps the sum odd after her turn. Eventually, Bob will be left with a sum of 1 coin, and Alice will take the last coin, making Bob unable to make a move and thus winning the game.

2. **Even Sum of Coins**: If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob can always ensure that Alice is left with an odd sum of coins after his turn. Using a similar strategy as Alice in the odd case, Bob can force Alice into a position where she will eventually be left with a sum of 1 coin, making Alice unable to make a move and thus winning the game.

Given this reasoning, the program correctly determines the winner based on whether the sum of the coins (a + b) is even or odd. If the sum is even, Bob wins, and if the sum is odd, Alice wins.
