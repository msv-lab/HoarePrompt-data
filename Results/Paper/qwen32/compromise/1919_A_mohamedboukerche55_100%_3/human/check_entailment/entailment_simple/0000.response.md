### Reasoning:

The problem revolves around the parity (even or odd nature) of the sum of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key insight is that the player who faces an even total number of coins (across both wallets) will always lose if both players play optimally. Conversely, the player who faces an odd total number of coins will always win under optimal play.

Here's the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Initial State and Moves**: Each player starts with a certain number of coins in their wallets. They can either swap wallets or not, and then they must remove one coin from their current wallet. The game ends when a player cannot make a move because both wallets are empty.

2. **Parity Analysis**:
   - If the sum of coins in both wallets is even, the first player (Alice) will always lose if both play optimally. This is because each move reduces the total number of coins by 1, changing the parity from even to odd, and so on. When the total number of coins becomes 1, the first player is forced to take the last coin and lose.
   - If the sum of coins in both wallets is odd, the first player (Alice) will always win if both play optimally. This is because each move changes the parity from odd to even, and so on. When the total number of coins becomes 1, the second player (Bob) is forced to take the last coin and lose.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `a` and `b` in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
   - It then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even, it prints "Bob" (indicating Bob wins).
   - If the sum is odd, it prints "Alice" (indicating Alice wins).

Given the logic in the program matches the derived strategy based on the parity of the sum of coins, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
