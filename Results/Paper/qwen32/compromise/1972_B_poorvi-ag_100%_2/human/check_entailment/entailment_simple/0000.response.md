### Reasoning:

The problem revolves around determining the winner of a game based on the number of facing-up coins in a circular arrangement. The key insight is that the game's outcome can be determined by the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins ('U').

- If the number of 'U' coins is odd, Alice will win.
- If the number of 'U' coins is even, Bob will win.

This is because Alice goes first and can always force the game into a state where Bob is left with an even number of 'U' coins, and vice versa. The game continues until there are no 'U' coins left, and the player who is forced to face this situation loses.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by counting the number of 'U' coins in the input string for each test case and appending 'yes' or 'no' to the results list based on whether the count is odd or even. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic described above and handles multiple test cases as specified. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness:** **True**
