Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32), representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a distinct string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. It then prints 'A' if the count of 'A' in the string is greater than the count of 'B', otherwise it prints 'B'.**
