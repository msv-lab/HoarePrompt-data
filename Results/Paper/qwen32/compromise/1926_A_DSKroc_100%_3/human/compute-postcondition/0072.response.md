Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `ac` is the count of 'A' characters in the string `s`, `bc` is the count of non-'A' characters in the string `s`, `s` is the original string input by the user, and `q` is incremented by 1. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, then `ac` is indeed greater than `bc`; otherwise, `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`.**
