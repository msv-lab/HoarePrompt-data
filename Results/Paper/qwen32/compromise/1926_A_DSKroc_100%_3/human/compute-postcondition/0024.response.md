Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32; `ac` is the total number of 'A's in the string `s`; `bc` is the total number of characters in the string `s` that are not 'A'; `s` is a string input by the user. Additionally, if `ac` is greater than `bc`, then `ac` is indeed greater than `bc`. Otherwise, `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`.**
