The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `n`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `count` is 2, and `ans` is equal to `n`.
