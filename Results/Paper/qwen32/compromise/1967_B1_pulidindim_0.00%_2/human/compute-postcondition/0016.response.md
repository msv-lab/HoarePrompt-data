The variable `g` is reassigned the value of `n / count`. Given that `count` is 3, `g` becomes `n / 3`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 4, `count` is 3, `ans` is `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1`, `countmins` is 2, `g` is `n / 3`.**
