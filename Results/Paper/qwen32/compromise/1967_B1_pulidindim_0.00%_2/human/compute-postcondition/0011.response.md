The value of `g` is decremented by `countmins`. Given that `g` is initially `n / 2` and `countmins` is 1, `g` will now be `n / 2 - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n`, `countmins` is 1, and `g` is `n / 2 - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n / 2 - 1`**.
