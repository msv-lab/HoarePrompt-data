The value of `g` is recalculated as `n / count`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is at least 3, `count` is 3, `countmins` is 2, `g` is `n / count`, `ans` is `n + (g / count + 1)`.
