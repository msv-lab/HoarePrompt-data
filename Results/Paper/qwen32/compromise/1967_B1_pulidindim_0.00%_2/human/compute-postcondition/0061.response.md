The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 4, `count` is 5, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `n / 4 - 3`, `ans` is updated by adding `g / count + 1` to its previous value. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the conditions remain as described.
