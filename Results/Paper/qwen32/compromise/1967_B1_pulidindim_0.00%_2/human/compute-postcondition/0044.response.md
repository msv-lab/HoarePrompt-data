The given code snippet modifies the value of `ans` by adding `g / count + 1` to it. Let's determine the new value of `ans` based on the initial state provided.

Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
- `i` is 1
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `m` is at least 2
- `count` is 2
- `ans` is `n`
- `countmins` is 1
- `g` is `n / count - 1`

The code snippet provided is:
```python
ans += g / count + 1
```

To find the new value of `ans`, we substitute the value of `g` and `count` into the expression `g / count + 1`.

Given that `g` is `n / count - 1` and `count` is 2:
- `g / count + 1` becomes `(n / count - 1) / count + 1`
- Substituting `count` with 2: `(n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1`
- Simplifying: `(n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1 = (n / 2 - 1 + 2) / 2 = (n / 2 + 1) / 2 = n / 4 + 1 / 2`

So, the new value of `ans` is `ans + n / 4 + 1 / 2`.

Given that `ans` was initially `n`, the new value of `ans` is `n + n / 4 + 1 / 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n + n / 4 + 1 / 2`, `countmins` is 1, and `g` is `n / count - 1`.**
