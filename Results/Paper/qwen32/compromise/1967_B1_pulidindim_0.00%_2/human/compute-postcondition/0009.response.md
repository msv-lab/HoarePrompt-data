The `break` statement does not affect any of the variables in the given initial state. It only exits the most internal loop or if statement it is placed within. Since there is no loop or if statement mentioned in the context, the variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n / 2`, and `g` is less than `countmins`.**
