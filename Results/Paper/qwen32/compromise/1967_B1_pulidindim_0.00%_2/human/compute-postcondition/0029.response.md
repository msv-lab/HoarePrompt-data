Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 4, `count` is less than `m` and `count` is incremented by 1, `ans` is `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1 + ((n / 3 - 2) / 3 + 1) + (g / count + 1)`, `countmins` is `count - 1`, and `g` is `n / count - countmins`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**

Natural Language: The value of `count` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions, except `countmins` which is now `count - 1`. The value of `g` is recalculated as `n / count - countmins`, and `ans` is recalculated using the new value of `count`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
