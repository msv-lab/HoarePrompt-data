Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions specified in the problem description. Let's analyze why the program is incorrect and provide a counterexample.

The condition given in the problem is:
\[ a + b \text{ is a multiple of } b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]

The provided program seems to follow a different logic that does not directly address this condition. Specifically, the program uses a loop that iterates over possible values of `count` and performs some calculations involving `gcd`, but it does not correctly count the valid pairs (a, b).

Let's consider a specific counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Counterexample:**
Input:
```
1
10 8
```

Expected Output:
```
14
```

Explanation of Expected Output:
The valid pairs (a, b) for this input are:
(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1), (10,2).

However, the provided program will not produce this output. Let's see why:

The program initializes `count = 2` and `ans = n`. It then enters a loop that iterates over possible values of `count` up to `m`. Inside the loop, it calculates `countmins` as `count - 1` and `g` as `n / count`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, it breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it updates `ans` by adding `g / count + 1` to it.

This logic does not correctly count the number of valid pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given condition. The program does not iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) and check if the condition holds for each pair. Instead, it uses a different approach that does not guarantee the correct count of valid pairs.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the correct answer is **False**.
