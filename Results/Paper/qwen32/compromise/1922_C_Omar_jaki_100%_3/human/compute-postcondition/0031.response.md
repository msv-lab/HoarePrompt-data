Postcondition: **The list remains `[0, 0, v1, v1, 2*v1, v1+v2, v1+v2, 2*v1+v2, ..., sum(v1, ..., vk), sum(v1, ..., vk), 2*sum(v1, ..., vk)]`. The variable `u` is now `u-1` and is still greater than 0. The variables `c` and `d` are the values returned by `r()`. No additional changes occur regardless of whether `c` is less than `d` or `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.**
