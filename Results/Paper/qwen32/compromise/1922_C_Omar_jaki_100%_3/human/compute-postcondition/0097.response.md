To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's break down the relevant parts of the initial state and the code:

1. **List `b`:** The list `b` is explicitly given as `[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]`.
2. **Variables `c` and `d`:** These are the return values of the function `r()`. We know that `c < d`. However, since the function `r()` is not provided, we need to make assumptions based on the constraints given. For the sake of this explanation, let's assume `c` and `d` are integers such that `c < d` and they are within the valid range to access elements in the list `b`.

Let's consider a plausible scenario where `c = 1` and `d = 2` (since `c < d` and both are positive integers). This is a reasonable assumption because these values will allow us to access valid indices in the list `b`.

Given `c = 1` and `d = 2`:
- `(d - 1) * 2` evaluates to `(2 - 1) * 2 = 1 * 2 = 2`.
- `(c - 1) * 2` evaluates to `(1 - 1) * 2 = 0 * 2 = 0`.

So, the expression `b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]` becomes `b[2] - b[0]`.

From the list `b = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]`:
- `b[2]` is `1`.
- `b[0]` is `0`.

Therefore, `b[2] - b[0]` evaluates to `1 - 0 = 1`.

Thus, the `print` statement will output `1`.

Output: **1**
