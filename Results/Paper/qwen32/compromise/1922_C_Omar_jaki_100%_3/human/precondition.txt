t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case in test_cases is a tuple containing three parts: an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, a list a of n integers where 0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9, and an integer m such that 1 <= m <= 10^5. Following m, there are m pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) where 1 <= x_i, y_i <= n and x_i != y_i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each city in each test case, the closest city is uniquely determined.
