### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not handle all cases properly. Specifically, the program only checks the uniformity of the first and last rows and columns. However, there are configurations where the first and last rows or columns are the same, but there are other rows or columns with different colors that cannot be changed using the given operation.

To illustrate, consider a grid like this:

```
W B W
B W B
W B W
```

In this grid, the first and last rows are the same ("W B W"), and the first and last columns are the same ("W B W"). However, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color using the given operation because the 'B' squares are surrounded by 'W' squares and vice versa, and no operation can change the color of these 'B' squares to 'W' or vice versa without affecting other squares in a way that doesn't meet the operation's constraints.

The provided program would incorrectly output "YES" for such a grid because it does not check for these internal inconsistencies.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
