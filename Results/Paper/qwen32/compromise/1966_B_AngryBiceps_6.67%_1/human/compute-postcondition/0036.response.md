The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a list containing the first input string, `first_row` is the first character of the last element in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the last element in `a`, `i` is 1**
