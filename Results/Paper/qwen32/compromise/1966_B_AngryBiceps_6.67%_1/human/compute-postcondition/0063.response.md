The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `t-1`, `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `t`. The variable `n` must still be greater than `t` for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` is `t`, `n` must be greater than `t`, `m` is the second integer read from the new input, `a` is a list containing one input string, `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a`**
