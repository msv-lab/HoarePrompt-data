The code snippet `a = []` reassigns the variable `a` to an empty list, discarding its previous value which was a list containing `n` elements, each being an input string. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is a string composed of the first character of each string in the original `a`, `last_row` is a string composed of the last character of each string in the original `a`, and `i` is `n-1`.**
