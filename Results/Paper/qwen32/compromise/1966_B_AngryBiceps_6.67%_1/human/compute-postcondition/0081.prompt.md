Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) representing the dimensions of the grid. The next n lines contain m characters each, which are either 'W' or 'B', representing the initial colors of the squares in the grid. The sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = []
    first_row = ''
    last_row = ''
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(input())
        first_row += a[-1][0]
        last_row += a[-1][-1]
    if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
        print('NO')
    elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input string, `first_row` is a string composed of the first character of each string in `a`, `last_row` is a string composed of the last character of each string in `a`, and `i` is `n-1`. If the length of the set of characters in the first string of `a` is 1 and the first string of `a` is not equal to the last string of `a`, the condition in the if block is met. Otherwise, either the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `t-1`, `n` is the second integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings, `first_row` is a string consisting of the first characters of each of the `n` input strings, `last_row` is a string consisting of the last characters of each of the `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`. If the length of the set of characters in the first string of `a` is 1 and the first string of `a` is not equal to the last string of `a`, the condition from the if part holds. Otherwise, either the length of the set of characters in `a[0]` is not equal to 1, or `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`. Additionally, either the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not equal to 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `t-1`, `n` is the first integer read from the new input, `m` is the second integer read from the new input, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings, `first_row` is a string composed of the first characters of each string in `a`, `last_row` is a string composed of the last characters of each string in `a`, `i` is `n-1`. If the first string in `a` has all identical characters and is not equal to the last string in `a`, then the condition in the if part holds. Otherwise, either the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not equal to 1 or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
