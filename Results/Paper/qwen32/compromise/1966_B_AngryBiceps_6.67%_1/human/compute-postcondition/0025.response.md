Postcondition: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input string, `first_row` is a string composed of the first character of each string in `a`, `last_row` is a string composed of the last character of each string in `a`, `i` is `n-1`. Either the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`. If the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is 1 and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`, the condition in the if block is met; otherwise, the condition in the else block is met.**

This postcondition summarizes the state after the if-else block, maintaining the initial conditions and adding the condition that either the if block or the else block was executed based on the specified criteria.
