The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last string in the list `a` to the `last_row` string. Given that `a` is a list containing one element which is the input string, `a[-1][-1]` refers to the last character of that string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input string, `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a`, `i` is 0**

In natural language: The variable `last_row` now holds the last character of the string contained in the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
