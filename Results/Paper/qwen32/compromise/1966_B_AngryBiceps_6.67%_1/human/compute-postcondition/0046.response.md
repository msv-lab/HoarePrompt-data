Based on the initial state provided, let's analyze the variables and the `print` statement.

1. **Variables and Initial State:**
   - `t` is `t-1`: This suggests that `t` is a decrement of some previous value of `t`, but its exact value is not critical for this print statement.
   - `n` and `m` are both the second integer read from the input. This indicates that the input has at least two integers, and `n` and `m` are the same.
   - `a` is a list containing `n` input strings.
   - `first_row` is a string consisting of the first characters of each of the `n` input strings.
   - `last_row` is a string consisting of the last characters of each of the `n` input strings.
   - `i` is `n-1`: This is the index of the last element in the list `a`.
   - The length of the set of characters in the first string of `a` is 1, meaning the first string consists of a single repeated character.
   - The first string of `a` is not equal to the last string of `a`.

2. **The Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement is `print('NO')`.

The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`. The values and conditions of the variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, `last_row`, `i`) do not influence the output of this specific `print` statement.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
