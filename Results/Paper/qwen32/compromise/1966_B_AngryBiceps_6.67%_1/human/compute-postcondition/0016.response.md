The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last string in the list `a` to the `last_row` string. Therefore, the value of `last_row` changes, but the values of the other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a list containing three elements: the original input string, the new input string, and the newly appended input string, `first_row` is the concatenation of the first character of the first string in `a`, the first character of the second string in `a`, and the first character of the last string in `a`, `last_row` is the concatenation of the original `last_row` and the last character of the last string in `a`, `i` is 2.**
