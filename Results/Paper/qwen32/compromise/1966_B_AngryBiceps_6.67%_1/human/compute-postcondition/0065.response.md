The code `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last string in the list `a` to the current value of `first_row`. 

Given that `first_row` is initially the first character of the first string in `a`, and `a[-1][0]` is the first character of the last string in `a`, the new value of `first_row` will be the concatenation of these two characters.

Output State: **`t` is `t`, `n` must be greater than `t`, `m` is the second integer read from the new input, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `first_row` is the first character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the first character of the last string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the first string in `a`.**
