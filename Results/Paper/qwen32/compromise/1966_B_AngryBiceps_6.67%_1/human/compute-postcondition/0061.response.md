The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last string in the list `a` to the `first_row` string. 

Given the initial state, `a` is a list containing one input string, so `a[-1][0]` refers to the first character of that string. Since `first_row` was initially an empty string, it will now contain this first character.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the new input, `a` is a list containing one input string, `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a`, `last_row` is an empty string**.
