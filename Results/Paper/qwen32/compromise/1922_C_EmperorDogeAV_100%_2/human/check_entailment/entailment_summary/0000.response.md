Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine the minimum cost to travel between two cities based on the given rules. It does this by first calculating the closest city for each city in both forward and backward directions and then using these calculations to compute the cost for each query.

However, there are several issues with the provided program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest Cities**: The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the cost of moving to the closest city for each city. However, it does not correctly determine the closest city for each city. Specifically, it only compares the current city with its immediate neighbors, which is not sufficient to determine the closest city when considering the problem constraints.

2. **Incorrect Use of Pref Sum Arrays**: The program calculates prefix sums based on the output of `func_1`, which is incorrect. The prefix sums should reflect the cost of moving from one city to the next via the closest city, but `func_1` does not provide this information correctly.

3. **Logic for Query Handling**: The program uses the prefix sums to calculate the cost for each query. However, since the prefix sums are calculated incorrectly, the results for the queries will also be incorrect.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the closest city is the same for multiple cities or when the cities are evenly spaced.

Given these issues, the program is not correctly implementing the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
