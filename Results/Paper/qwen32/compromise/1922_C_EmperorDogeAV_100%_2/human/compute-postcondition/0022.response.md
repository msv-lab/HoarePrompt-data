The code sets the value of `prog_cities[i]` to 1. The values of `i`, `back`, `forward`, and `n` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1. If `i` was greater than 0 before the increment, `back` is set to `cities[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `back` remains -99999999999999999999. If `i < n - 1`, `forward` is set to `cities[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `forward` remains 999999999999999999. `prog_cities[i]` is 1.**
