Output State: **`cities` is a list of lists, where each sublist represents a test case and contains integers. The first integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) represents the number of cities, followed by `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities. The next integer `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) represents the number of queries, followed by `m` pairs of integers x_i, y_i (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i) representing the queries. `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros. `n` is at least 2; `back` is `cities[i - 1]`; `forward` is 999999999999999999. The current value of `i` is greater than 0.**

In simple terms: The value of `back` has been updated to the value of `cities[i - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
