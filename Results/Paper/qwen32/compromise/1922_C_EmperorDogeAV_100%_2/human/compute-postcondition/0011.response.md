The code snippet provided modifies the `prog_cities` list by setting the element at index `i` to 1. No other variables are directly affected by this statement.

Given the initial state:
- `cities` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains integers representing the number of cities and their coordinates.
- `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros.
- `n` is at least 2.
- `back` and `forward` are set based on the value of `i` but are not directly modified by the provided code snippet.
- The absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`.

After executing the code snippet `prog_cities[i] = 1`, the value at index `i` in the `prog_cities` list is changed from 0 to 1. All other elements and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cities` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains integers representing the number of cities and their coordinates; `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros except at index `i` where it is 1; `n` is at least 2; if `i` is greater than 0, `back` is set to `cities[i - 1]`; otherwise, `back` remains -99999999999999999999; if `i` is less than `n - 1`, `forward` is set to `cities[i + 1]`; otherwise, `forward` remains 999999999999999999; the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`.**
