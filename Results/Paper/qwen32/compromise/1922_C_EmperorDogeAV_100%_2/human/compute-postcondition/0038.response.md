Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `cities`, which is a list of lists. Each sublist in `cities` represents a test case and contains integers where the first integer `n` indicates the number of cities, followed by `n` integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order. The function returns a list `prog_cities` containing `n - 1` elements for each test case. Each element at index `i` in `prog_cities` is `1` if the absolute difference between the coordinates of city `i + 1` and city `i` is less than the absolute difference between the coordinates of city `i` and city `i - 1` (for `i > 0`), otherwise it is the absolute difference between the coordinates of city `i + 1` and city `i`.**
