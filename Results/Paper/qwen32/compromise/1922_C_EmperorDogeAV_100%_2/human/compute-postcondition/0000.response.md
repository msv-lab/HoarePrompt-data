The code snippet initializes a list named `prog_cities` with `n - 1` zeros. The initial state specifies that `cities` is a list of lists, where each sublist represents a test case and contains integers. The first integer `n` in each sublist represents the number of cities, followed by `n` integers representing the coordinates of the cities. Additionally, there are `m` queries, each represented by a pair of integers.

The execution of the code snippet does not affect the `cities` list or any other variables mentioned in the initial state except for the creation of `prog_cities`. The length of `prog_cities` is determined by the value of `n` from the current test case.

Output State: **`cities` is a list of lists, where each sublist represents a test case and contains integers. The first integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) represents the number of cities, followed by `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities. The next integer `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) represents the number of queries, followed by `m` pairs of integers x_i, y_i (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i) representing the queries. `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros.**
