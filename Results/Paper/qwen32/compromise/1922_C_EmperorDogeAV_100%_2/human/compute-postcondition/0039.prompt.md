You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of lists, where each sublist represents a test case and contains integers. The first integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) represents the number of cities, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities. The next integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) represents the number of queries, followed by m pairs of integers x_i, y_i (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i) representing the queries. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        
        forward = 999999999999999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
        
    #State: `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` elements where each element at index `i` is `1` if the absolute difference between `cities[i + 1]` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `cities[i - 1]` (for `i > 0`), otherwise it is the absolute difference between `cities[i + 1]` and `cities[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
    return prog_cities
    #The program returns the list `prog_cities` which contains `n - 1` elements where each element at index `i` is `1` if the absolute difference between `cities[i + 1]` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `cities[i - 1]` (for `i > 0`), otherwise it is the absolute difference between `cities[i + 1]` and `cities[i]`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `cities`, which is a list of lists. Each sublist in `cities` represents a test case and contains integers where the first integer `n` indicates the number of cities, followed by `n` integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order. The function returns a list `prog_cities` containing `n - 1` elements for each test case. Each element at index `i` in `prog_cities` is `1` if the absolute difference between the coordinates of city `i + 1` and city `i` is less than the absolute difference between the coordinates of city `i` and city `i - 1` (for `i > 0`), otherwise it is the absolute difference between the coordinates of city `i + 1` and city `i`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `prog_cities` which contains `n - 1` elements where each element at index `i` is `1` if the absolute difference between `cities[i + 1]` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `cities[i - 1]` (for `i > 0`), otherwise it is the absolute difference between `cities[i + 1]` and `cities[i]`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
