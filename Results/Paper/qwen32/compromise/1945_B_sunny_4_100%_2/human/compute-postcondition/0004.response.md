Functionality: **The function accepts three integer parameters `a`, `b`, and `m` for each of the `t` test cases, where `a` is the frequency of launching fireworks for the first installation, `b` is the frequency of launching fireworks for the second installation, and `m` is the visibility time of each firework. For each test case, the function returns the number of time intervals during which fireworks from both installations are visible in the sky simultaneously.**
