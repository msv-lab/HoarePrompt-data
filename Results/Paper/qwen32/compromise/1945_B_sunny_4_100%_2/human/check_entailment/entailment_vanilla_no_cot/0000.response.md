Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic in the program is flawed and does not account for the overlap of fireworks' visibility periods.

Let's analyze the correct approach to solve the problem:

1. **Identify the Overlapping Periods**: We need to find the times when the fireworks from both installations are visible simultaneously. This involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, since fireworks from both installations will overlap at multiples of the LCM.

2. **Count Fireworks Within the Overlapping Period**: For each installation, count the number of fireworks that are visible within the interval `[0, m]`.

3. **Calculate Overlapping Fireworks**: Determine how many fireworks from both installations overlap within the interval `[0, m]`.

4. **Sum the Counts**: Add the counts of fireworks from both installations and subtract the overlapping counts to avoid double-counting.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // math.gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
        A = m // a + 1
        B = m // b + 1
        AB = m // lcm_ab + 1
        ans = A + B - AB
        print(ans)

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time by considering the overlap of visibility periods.
