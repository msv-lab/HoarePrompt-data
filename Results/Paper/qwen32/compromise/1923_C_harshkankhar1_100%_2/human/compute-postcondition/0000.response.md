The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `q`. The initial state specifies that `n` and `q` are integers within certain bounds, and the code updates these values based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `q` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `q` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9; for each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. `n` and `q` are assigned the values from the input.**
