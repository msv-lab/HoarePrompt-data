The function `func_1` determines the winner of a game based on the input list `arr`. The list `arr` starts with an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. The function returns 'Alice' if the first element `t` is not equal to 1, or if a specific condition related to the uniqueness and consecutive nature of the stone counts is met. Otherwise, it returns 'Bob'.
