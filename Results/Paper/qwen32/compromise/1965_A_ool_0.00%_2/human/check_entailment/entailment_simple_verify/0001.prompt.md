You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

Output

    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The game described is essentially a variant of the Nim game, where the key to determining the winner lies in the parity (odd or even) of the number of piles with a certain property. Specifically, the game can be analyzed using the concept of Grundy numbers or Nim-sum, but in this case, a simpler observation suffices:

- If all piles are of the same height, Alice wins if the number of piles is odd and Bob wins if it is even.
- If the piles are not all of the same height, Alice can always force a win by reducing the game to the first scenario (all piles of the same height) with an odd number of piles.

### Program Analysis:
The given program attempts to determine the winner based on the following logic:

1. **Initial Check**: If the smallest pile has more than one stone (`arr[0] != 1`), it immediately concludes that Alice wins. This is incorrect because the game's outcome depends on the relative sizes of all piles, not just the smallest one.
2. **Unique Pile Heights**: The program creates a set of unique pile heights, sorts them, and checks if the differences between consecutive heights are all 1. If so, it toggles a boolean variable `A` for each step, and the final value of `A` determines the winner.
3. **Final Decision**: If the differences are not all 1, it sets `A` to `False`, otherwise, it toggles `A` one more time before determining the winner.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Initial Check**: The condition `if arr[0] != 1` is incorrect. The game's outcome is not determined solely by the smallest pile's size.
- **Incorrect Logic for Unique Heights**: The logic for determining the winner based on the sorted unique pile heights is flawed. It does not correctly account for the game's rules and the optimal play by both players.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine the winner, the program should:
- Count the number of piles of the smallest size.
- If this count is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner of the game. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
