Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules described. The logic in the function `func_1` is flawed and does not follow the optimal strategy for the game.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Misinterpretation of the Game Rules**:
   - The game involves removing the same number of stones from each non-empty pile until no stones are left. The player who cannot make a move loses.
   - The optimal strategy involves understanding the Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes). If the Nim-sum is zero at the start, the second player can always force a win with optimal play. If the Nim-sum is non-zero, the first player can always force a win with optimal play.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` incorrectly uses the presence of consecutive integers in the sorted set of pile sizes to determine the winner.
   - It checks if the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted set is more than 1 to decide the winner, which is not related to the game rules or the optimal strategy.

3. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the test case:
     ```
     1
     3
     1 2 3
     ```
   - The Nim-sum of `[1, 2, 3]` is `1 ^ 2 ^ 3 = 0`. According to the game rules, Bob should win in this case.
   - The function `func_1` will return 'Alice' for this input because the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted set `[1, 2, 3]` are 1, and the logic incorrectly determines that Alice wins.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach involves calculating the Nim-sum of the pile sizes and determining the winner based on whether the Nim-sum is zero or non-zero.

Here's a corrected version of the function using the Nim-sum approach:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    nim_sum = 0
    for num in arr:
        nim_sum ^= num
    return 'Alice' if nim_sum != 0 else 'Bob'

# The rest of the code remains the same
```

This corrected function will correctly determine the winner for all valid inputs based on the optimal strategy of the game.
