The code snippet only assigns the value `True` to the variable `not_c`. None of the other variables (`arr`, `A`, `set_`) are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the state of these variables remains the same.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of lines where the first line of each pair contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5; `A` is `False`; `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr`, sorted in ascending order; `not_c` is `True`.**
