Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `t` is 0, `c` will be the cumulative sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` over all iterations, `k` will be reduced by the cumulative sum of `s` over all iterations, `i` will be `n`, `m`, `n`, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `t` has been set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions as described in the initial state.
