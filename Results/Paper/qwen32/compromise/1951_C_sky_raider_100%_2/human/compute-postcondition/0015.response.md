`t` is updated to `t + s`. Given that `t` was initially `s`, `t` is now `s + s`, which simplifies to `2 * s`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `2 * s`; `n` must be greater than 0; `m` and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` now being `k - s`; `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k - s`; `c` is `s * (2 * l[i] + t)`; `i` is 1.**
