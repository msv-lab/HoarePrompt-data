Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is `k - 2 * s - s`, `t` is `3 * s`, `c` is `2 * s * l[0] + 3 * s * s + s * l[i]`, `i` is `1`, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by `s`. Since `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, the new value of `k` is `k - s`. All other variables remain unchanged.
