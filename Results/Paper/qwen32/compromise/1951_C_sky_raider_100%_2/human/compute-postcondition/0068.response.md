The code snippet `t += s` increments the value of `t` by the value of `s`. Given that `t` was initially `2 * s`, after the operation, `t` becomes `2 * s + s`, which simplifies to `3 * s`.

All other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions about `n`, `m`, `k`, `c`, `i`, `l`, and `s` still hold true.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is `k - 2 * s`, `t` is `3 * s`, `c` is `2 * s * l[0] + 3 * s * s + s * l[i]`, `i` is `1`, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`**.
