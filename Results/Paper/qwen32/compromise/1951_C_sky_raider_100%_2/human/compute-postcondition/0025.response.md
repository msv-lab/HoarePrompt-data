The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This operation overwrites the previous values of `n`, `m`, and `k` with the new input values. The variables `t`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this code snippet.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `n * s_final`
- `c` is `s_final * (sum(l[0:n]) + (n-1) * s_final)`
- `k` is `k - n * s_final`
- `i` is `i + 1`

After executing the code snippet, the new values for `n`, `m`, and `k` are taken from the input, and the other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is `n * s_final`, `c` is `s_final * (sum(l[0:n]) + (n-1) * s_final)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are the values read from the input.**
