Let's analyze the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to perform exactly k operations on an array, where in each operation, we select any contiguous subarray and insert the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array. The goal is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such operations, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided code:

#### Function 1: `func_1(number)`
```python
def func_1(number):
    return number % 1000000007
```
- This function simply returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). It's a utility function for handling large numbers.

#### Function 2: `func_2(arr)`
```python
def func_2(arr):
    new_segment = []
    max_segment = [0, 0]
    segments_variants = []
    max_sum = -1
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if new_segment:
            if arr[i] < 0:
                if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
                else:
                    segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                    max_segment = new_segment
                new_segment = []
                max_segment[0] += arr[i]
            else:
                max_segment[0] += arr[i]
                new_segment[0] += arr[i]
        else:
            if arr[i] >= 0:
                new_segment = [arr[i], i]
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    segments_variants.append(new_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    total_max_segment = [-1]
    for segment in segments_variants:
        if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0] and len(segment) != 1:
            total_max_segment = segment
    return total_max_segment
```
- This function is intended to find the maximum sum contiguous subarray in the array `arr`. It uses a variation of Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum subarray.
- However, the implementation is flawed. The `max_segment` and `new_segment` variables are not correctly managed, and the logic for appending segments to `segments_variants` is incorrect. This function is supposed to return the maximum sum subarray, but it does not do so correctly.

#### Function 3: `func_3(number, quantity)`
```python
def func_3(number, quantity):
    answer = 0
```
- This function is incomplete and does not implement the logic for performing the operations and calculating the maximum possible sum.

### Correctness Evaluation

The provided program is incomplete and contains errors, particularly in `func_2`. The logic for finding the maximum sum subarray is flawed, and `func_3` is not implemented at all.

### Correctness
Based on the analysis, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
