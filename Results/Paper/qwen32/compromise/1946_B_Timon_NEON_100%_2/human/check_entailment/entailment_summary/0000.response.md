### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations. In each operation, you can select any contiguous subarray and insert the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array.

The provided code consists of three functions, but only two are used in the main logic:
1. `func_1`: This function takes an integer and returns it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
2. `func_2`: This function finds the contiguous subarray with the maximum sum and returns a list containing the maximum sum, the starting index of this subarray, and the ending index of this subarray.

The main logic of the program is as follows:
- For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the number of operations `k`.
- It reads the array `a` of `n` integers.
- It calls `func_2` to find the contiguous subarray with the maximum sum.
- If the maximum sum is negative, it is set to 0.
- It calculates the final answer using the formula:
  \[
  \text{answer} = \text{max\_segment}[0] \times 2^k + \text{sum}(a) - \text{max\_segment}[0]
  \]
- It prints the result after applying modulo \(10^9 + 7\) using `func_1`.

Let's analyze the correctness of the program:
- `func_1` correctly computes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
- `func_2` correctly finds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray using a modified version of Kadane's algorithm, which is appropriate for this task.
- The formula used to calculate the final answer is based on the idea that the best strategy is to repeatedly add the maximum subarray sum to the array, which effectively doubles the contribution of the maximum subarray sum `k` times.

However, there is a flaw in the formula used:
- The formula `max_segment[0] * 2^k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]` is incorrect because it subtracts `max_segment[0]` after adding it `2^k` times. This subtraction is unnecessary and incorrect.
- The correct formula should be:
  \[
  \text{answer} = (\text{max\_segment}[0] \times (2^k - 1)) + \text{sum}(a)
  \]
- This formula correctly accounts for the fact that the maximum subarray sum is added `2^k - 1` times in addition to the original sum of the array.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the incorrect formula used to calculate the final answer.

Correctness: **False**
