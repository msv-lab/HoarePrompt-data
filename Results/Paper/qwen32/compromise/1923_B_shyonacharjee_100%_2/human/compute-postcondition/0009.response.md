The code snippet assigns the value of `abs(pos)` to the variable `distance`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `pos`, we can only express `distance` in terms of `pos`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 3 * 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `x` is a list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the elements in `x` and must contain at least one tuple; `bullets_used` is 0; `can_survive` is True; `distance` is `abs(pos)`**.
