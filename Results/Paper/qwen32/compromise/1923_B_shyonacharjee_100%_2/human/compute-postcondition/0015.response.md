Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 3 * 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `x` is a list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the elements in `x` and must contain at least one tuple; `bullets_used` is `health`; `distance` is `abs(pos)`; `total_bullets_needed` is `health`. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, `can_survive` is set to False. Otherwise, `can_survive` remains True. The values of the other variables do not change.**

In this output state, `bullets_used` has been updated to the value of `health`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
