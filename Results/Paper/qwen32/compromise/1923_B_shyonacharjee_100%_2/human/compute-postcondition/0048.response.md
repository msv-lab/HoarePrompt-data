Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 3 * 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `x` is a list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the elements in `x` and must have at least one more tuple; `bullets_used` is `bullets_used` + `health` from the previous iteration; `can_survive` is False if `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, otherwise `can_survive` remains True; `distance` is `abs(pos)` from the next tuple in `monsters`; `total_bullets_needed` is `health` from the previous iteration; `pos` and `health` are from the next tuple in `monsters`.**

In this output state, the value of `distance` has been updated to the absolute value of `pos` from the next tuple in `monsters`. All other variables retain their previous values or states.
