Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 3 * 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `x` is a list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the elements in `x`; `bullets_used` is 0; `can_survive` is True.
Code of the loop:
for pos, health in monsters:
    distance = abs(pos)
    total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
    if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
        can_survive = False
        break
    bullets_used += health


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 3 * 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `x` is a list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the elements in `x` and must contain at least one tuple; `bullets_used` is `health`; `distance` is `abs(pos)`; `total_bullets_needed` is `health`. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, `can_survive` is set to False. Otherwise, `can_survive` remains True. The values of the other variables do not change.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 3 * 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `x` is a list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the elements in `x` and must contain at least two tuples; `pos` is the position of the next monster; `health` is the health of the next monster; `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`; `bullets_used` is increased by `health`; `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, `can_survive` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 3 * 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `x` is a list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the elements in `x` and must contain at least two tuples; `pos` and `health` are the values from the next tuple in `monsters`; `bullets_used` is increased by `health`; `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, then `can_survive` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without changing `can_survive`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
