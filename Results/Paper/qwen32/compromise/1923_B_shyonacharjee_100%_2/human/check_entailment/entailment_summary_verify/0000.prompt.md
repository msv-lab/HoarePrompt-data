You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    -3 -2 3 4 5
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))
        bullets_used = 0
        can_survive = True
        for (pos, health) in monsters:
            distance = abs(pos)
            total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
            if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
                can_survive = False
                break
            bullets_used += health
        print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `x`. For each test case, it determines whether it is possible to defeat all monsters, where each monster has a position `x[i]` and health `a[i]`, using bullets with a maximum range of `k` units. The function prints 'YES' if all monsters can be defeated without exceeding the bullet range for any monster, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Program Analysis:

The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of:
- `n`: number of monsters.
- `k`: maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second.
- `a`: list of integers representing the health of each monster.
- `x`: list of integers representing the initial positions of each monster.

The program aims to determine if all monsters can be killed before any of them reach the character at position 0.

The logic of the program is as follows:
1. It sorts the monsters based on their distance from the character (using `abs(pos)`).
2. It iterates through the sorted list of monsters, calculating the total bullets needed to kill each monster.
3. For each monster, it checks if the total bullets used so far plus the bullets needed to kill the current monster exceed the maximum bullets that can be fired before the monster reaches the character (`distance * k`).
4. If at any point the total bullets needed exceed the maximum allowed, it sets `can_survive` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
5. Finally, it prints "YES" if the character can survive and kill all monsters, otherwise "NO".

### Potential Issues:

1. **Sorting by Distance**: Sorting the monsters by their distance from the character ensures that closer monsters are considered first, which is a reasonable strategy to maximize the chances of survival.
2. **Bullet Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the total bullets needed and checks if it exceeds the maximum allowed (`distance * k`).
3. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the case where the number of bullets needed exceeds the maximum allowed before a monster reaches the character.
4. **Multiple Test Cases**: The program processes multiple test cases as required.

### Testing with Example Inputs:

Let's verify the program with the provided example inputs to ensure it works correctly.

- Maximum bullets allowed: `1*1, 2*1` (1, 2)
- Total bullets used: `1, 3` (exceeds limit for second monster)

Based on the analysis and testing with example inputs, the program appears to correctly determine if the character can survive and kill all monsters without letting any of them reach the character. There are no obvious issues or edge cases that the program fails to handle.

Correctness: **True**.
