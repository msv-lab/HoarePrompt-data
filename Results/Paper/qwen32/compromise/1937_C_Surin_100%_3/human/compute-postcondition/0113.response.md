`prev` is assigned the value of `i`, which is `n-1`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which the user input `r` was less than 0 or 0 if no such input was received, `i` is `n-1`, `prev` is `n-1`, `r` is '=', `r2` is '<'.
