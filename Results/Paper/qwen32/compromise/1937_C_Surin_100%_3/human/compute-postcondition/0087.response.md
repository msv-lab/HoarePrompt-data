Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

- `kp` is set to 1.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `g` is set to 0.
- `v1` is initialized to `n-1`.
- `i` is also initialized to `n-1`.
- `v2` is initialized to `n-1`.
- `r` is the user input.
- The value of `prev` depends on the value of `r` and `r2`, but it is not used in the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Since `v1` and `v2` are both initialized to `n-1`, the print statement will output the value of `n-1` four times, preceded by a question mark.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [n-1] [n-1] [n-1] [n-1] (where [n-1] is the value of n minus 1)**
