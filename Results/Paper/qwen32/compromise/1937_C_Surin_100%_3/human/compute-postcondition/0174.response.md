The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any of the variables in the given initial state. It is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that all output is written to the console immediately. Since there are no changes to the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest i for which r was '<', or 0 if r was never '<', `i` is 1, `prev` is 0, `v2` is n-1**.
