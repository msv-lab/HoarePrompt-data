The code snippet `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` to `v1`. Given the initial state, `v2` is `n-1`, so `v1` will also be `n-1` after this assignment. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `prev` is the final value determined by the loop based on user inputs `r` and `r2`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the value provided by the user input.**
