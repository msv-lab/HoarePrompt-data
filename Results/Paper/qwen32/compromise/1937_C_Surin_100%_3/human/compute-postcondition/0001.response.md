The provided code snippet only defines a lambda function `R` that reads an integer from the input. This function is not used in the code snippet itself, so there are no changes to the state of the program other than the definition of `R`. The initial state mentions multiple test cases and conditions related to those test cases, which remain unchanged.

Output State: **There are multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴) representing the length of a permutation p of {0, 1, ..., n-1}. For each test case, the function can make at most 3n queries to compare bitwise OR operations on pairs of elements in p, and must identify a pair of indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized. `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split string to an integer, and returns the result as a list of integers.**
