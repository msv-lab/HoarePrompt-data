Output State: **`kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`**

Explanation: The value of `v1` is updated to be equal to `v2`, but since both `v1` and `v2` were already equal to `n-1`, the value of `v1` remains `n-1`. The other variables (`kp`, `n`, `g`, `i`, and `v2`) remain unchanged.
