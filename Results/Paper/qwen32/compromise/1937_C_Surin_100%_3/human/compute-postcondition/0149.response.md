The value of `v2` is assigned the value of `i`. Since `i` is `n` (before the input), `v2` will be equal to `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `kp` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is `n`, `prev` is the final value determined by the loop based on user inputs `r` and `r2`, and `v2` is `n`.
