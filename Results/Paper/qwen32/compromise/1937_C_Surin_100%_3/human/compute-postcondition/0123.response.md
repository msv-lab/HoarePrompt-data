The code snippet provided only contains `sys.stdout.flush()`, which is a function call to flush the output buffer. This operation does not change the values of any variables or the state of the program in terms of variable assignments or conditions.

Given this, the values of `kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `i`, `r`, `prev`, and `r2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which the user input `r` was `<` or `0` if no such input was received, `i` is `n-1`, `r` is the new user input, `prev` is `n-1` if `r` is `'>'` and `r2` is `'<'`; otherwise, `prev` remains 0 if `r` is `'='` and `r2` is not `'<'`; `r2` is the new user input if `r` is `'='`**.
