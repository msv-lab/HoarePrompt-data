The code snippet `v2 = i` assigns the value of `i` to `v2`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n`, so `v2` will now also be `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n`, `i` is `n`, `prev` is the final value determined by the loop based on user inputs `r` and `r2`, `v2` is `n`. If `r` is `'<'`, then `r` remains `'<'`.**
