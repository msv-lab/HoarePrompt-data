The given code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream. This operation does not change the values of any variables in the program. Therefore, the values of `kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `i`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is the input integer that must be greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was `'<'` during the iterations, `i` is 3, `r` is the input string**.
