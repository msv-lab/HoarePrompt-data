The variable `n` is reassigned to the value of the user input converted to an integer. The other variables (`kp`, `g`, `v1`, `i`, `prev`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`kp` is 2, `n` is the user input converted to an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which the user input `r` was `<` or `0` if no such input was received, `i` is `n` (before the input), `prev` is the final value determined by the loop based on user inputs `r` and `r2`.**
