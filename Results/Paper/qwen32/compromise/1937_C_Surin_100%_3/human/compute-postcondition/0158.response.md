Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `kp` is 2.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is initialized to the value of `n`.
- `i` is initialized to the value of `n`.
- `prev` is the final value determined by the loop based on user inputs `r` and `r2`.
- `v2` is initialized to the value of `n`.
- If `r` is `'<'`, then `r` remains `'<'`.

### Key Points:
- The variables `v1` and `v2` are both initialized to the value of `n`.
- The variable `prev` is mentioned but its value is not explicitly given; it is dependent on the loop and user inputs `r` and `r2`, but it is not used in the print statement.
- The print statement uses `v1` and `v2` directly.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

### Explanation:
- The print statement is a formatted string that will output the value of `v1` and `v2` twice each.
- Since `v1` and `v2` are both initialized to `n`, the output will be the value of `n` printed four times, separated by spaces.
- The format string starts with a literal `?` followed by the values of `v1`, `v1`, `v2`, and `v2`.

### Final Output:
Given that `v1` and `v2` are both `n`, the output will be `? n n n n`.

Output: **? n n n n (where n is greater than 1)**
