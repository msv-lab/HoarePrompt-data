Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

**Initial State:**
- `kp` is 1
- `n` is greater than 1
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is `n-1`
- `i` is `n-1`
- `v2` is `n-1`

**Print Statement:**
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

**Analysis:**
1. We need to determine the values of `v1` and `v2`.
2. According to the initial state, `v1` and `v2` are both defined as `n-1`.

Since `n` is greater than 1, `n-1` will be an integer value greater than 0.

**Substituting the values:**
- `v1` = `n-1`
- `v2` = `n-1`

The print statement will format the string with these values:
```
'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}'
```
Given that `v1` and `v2` are both `n-1`, the formatted string will look like:
```
'? (n-1) (n-1) (n-1) (n-1)'
```

**Output:**
Output: **? n-1 n-1 n-1 n-1 (where n-1 is the value of n minus 1)**
