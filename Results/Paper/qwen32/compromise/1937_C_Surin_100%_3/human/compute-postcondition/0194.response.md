The provided code snippet contains only `sys.stdout.flush()`, which is a function call that flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream. This operation does not change any of the variables or their values. It merely ensures that any buffered output is written to the console immediately.

Therefore, none of the variables (`kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `i`, `v2`, `r`, `prev`) are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if `r` was never '<', `i` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is an input value. If `r` is '>', `prev` is 1. If `r` is '=', `prev` is 1 if `r2` is '<', otherwise `prev` remains 0.**
