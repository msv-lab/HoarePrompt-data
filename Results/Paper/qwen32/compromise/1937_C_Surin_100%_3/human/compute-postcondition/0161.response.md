The code snippet `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` to `v1`. Given that `v2` is `n` and `v1` was also `n`, the value of `v1` remains `n` after the assignment. The other variables (`kp`, `n`, `g`, `i`, `prev`, `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n`, `i` is `n`, `prev` is the final value determined by the loop based on user inputs `r` and `r2`, `v2` is `n`, `r` is the value provided by the user input.**
