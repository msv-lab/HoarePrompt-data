The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to the variable `prev`. The value of `i` is `n`, so `prev` will now hold the value of `n`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which the user input `r` was `<` or `0` if no such input was received, `i` is `n`, `r` is the new user input, `r2` is the new user input, `prev` is `n`.**
