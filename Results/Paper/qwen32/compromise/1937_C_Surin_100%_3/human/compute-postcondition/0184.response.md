The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `prev`. Given that `i` is 1, `prev` will now also hold the value 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest i for which r was '<', or 0 if r was never '<', `i` is 1, `prev` is 1, `v2` is n-1, `r` is '=', `r2` is '<'.**
