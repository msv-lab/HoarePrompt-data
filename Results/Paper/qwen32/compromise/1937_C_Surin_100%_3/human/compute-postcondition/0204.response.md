Output State: **`kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if `r` was never '<', `i` is 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is an input value, `prev` is 3.**

In this output state, the value of `prev` has been updated to 3, which is the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
