The code snippet `r2 = input('')` assigns the value of a new input string to the variable `r2`. This input operation does not affect the values of the other variables (`kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `i`, `r`). 

Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is the input integer that must be greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was `'<'` during the iterations, `i` is 3, `r` is the new input string, `r2` is the new input string.**
