The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, as the range is from 1 to `n-1`.

Given that `i` is initially `n-1`, this state does not help the loop to start executing because the loop expects `i` to start from 1. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to 1 to ensure the loop can execute. The value of `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure that the range `(1, n)` is not empty.

So, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` being greater than 1 and `i` being 1.

State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is the input integer that must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was `'<'` during the iterations, `i` is 1, `prev` is 0**
