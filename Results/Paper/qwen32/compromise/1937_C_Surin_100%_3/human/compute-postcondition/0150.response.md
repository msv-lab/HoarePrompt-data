Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

- **Initial State:**
  - `kp` is 2
  - `n` must be greater than 1
  - `g` is 0
  - `v1` is 0
  - `i` is `n`
  - `prev` is the final value determined by the loop based on user inputs `r` and `r2`
  - `v2` is `n`

- **Print Statement:**
  ```python
  print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
  ```

From the initial state, we know the following:
- `v1` is explicitly set to 0.
- `v2` is explicitly set to `n`, and since `n` must be greater than 1, `v2` will be some integer greater than 1.
- The value of `prev` is mentioned to be determined by the loop based on user inputs `r` and `r2`, but this value is not used in the print statement.

Given the print statement, we are asked to print the following:
- The first placeholder `{v1}` will be replaced by the value of `v1`, which is 0.
- The second placeholder `{v1}` will also be replaced by the value of `v1`, which is 0.
- The third placeholder `{v2}` will be replaced by the value of `v2`, which is `n`.
- The fourth placeholder `{v2}` will also be replaced by the value of `v2`, which is `n`.

Since `n` is greater than 1, let's denote `n` as some integer `x` where `x > 1`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **? 0 0 n n (where n is some integer greater than 1)**

However, since `n` is not given a specific value, we'll represent it as `n` in the final output.

Output: **? 0 0 n n**
