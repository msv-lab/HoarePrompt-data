The code snippet provided is:

```python
g = 0
```

This line of code sets the variable `g` to 0. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is that `g` is now 0, and all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`kp` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was `'<'` during the iterations, `i` is `n-1`, `prev` is the final value updated based on the responses `r` and `r2`.**
