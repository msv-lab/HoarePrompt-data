Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the exact output.

### Initial State:
- `kp` is 2.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if `r` was never '<'.
- `i` is 1.
- `prev` is 0.
- `v2` is `n-1`.
- `r` is '='.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement is a formatted string that includes the values of `i`, `i` again, `prev`, and `prev` again.
- From the initial state, we know:
  - `i` is 1.
  - `prev` is 0.

### Substituting the Values:
- The first `{i}` in the string will be replaced with the value of `i`, which is 1.
- The second `{i}` in the string will also be replaced with the value of `i`, which is 1.
- The first `{prev}` in the string will be replaced with the value of `prev`, which is 0.
- The second `{prev}` in the string will also be replaced with the value of `prev`, which is 0.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output:
Output: **? 1 1 0 0**
