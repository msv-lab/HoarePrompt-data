The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. The values of `t`, `a`, `todo`, `done`, `extra`, `j`, and `ans` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is any integer; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is an integer provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `todo` is a set of unique integers that were in `todo` initially but have been adjusted based on the last `n - m` elements of `a`; `done` is a set containing all elements from the last `n - m` elements of `a` that were originally in `todo`; `extra` is a set containing all elements from the last `n - m` elements of `a` that were not in `todo`; `j` is `m`; `ans` is the number of times during the loop that the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k`. `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input.**
