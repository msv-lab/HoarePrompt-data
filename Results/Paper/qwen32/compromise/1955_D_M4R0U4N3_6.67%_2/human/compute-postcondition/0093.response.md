The code snippet `extra.add(a[j])` adds the element `a[j]` to the set `extra`. Given that `j` is initially 2, `extra.add(a[j])` adds the element `a[2]` to the set `extra`.

Let's update the state of `extra` accordingly while keeping other variables unchanged:

- If `a[2]` was not already in `extra`, it will be added.
- If `a[2]` was already in `extra`, the set `extra` remains unchanged because sets do not allow duplicate elements.

The other variables (`t`, `m`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `todo`, `done`, `j`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is an integer provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input, excluding `a[1]` if `a[1]` was in `todo`; `done` is a set containing the element `a[0]` if `a[0]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` remains an empty set, and now also contains `a[1]` if `a[1]` was in `todo`; `extra` is an empty set if `a[0]` was in `todo`, otherwise `extra` contains the integer `a[0]` and `a[1]` if `a[1]` was not in `todo`, and now also contains `a[2]`; `j` is 2; `ans` is the number of times during the loop that the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k`.**
