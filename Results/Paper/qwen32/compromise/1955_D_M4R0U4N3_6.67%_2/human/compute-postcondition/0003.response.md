The code snippet provided creates a set named `todo` from the integers provided by the input. This set will contain unique integers from the input. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `todo` is a set of unique integers obtained from the input.**
