The code snippet provided is `todo.remove(a[r])`. This line of code removes the element `a[r]` from the set `todo`. Let's determine the impact on the variables based on the given initial state.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `m` is any integer.
- `n` is an integer greater than `m`.
- `k` is an integer provided by the input.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `todo` is a set of unique integers obtained from the input, except it no longer contains any elements that were in `a` and also in `todo`.
- `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo`, with adjustments based on the presence of `old`.
- `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo`, with `old` removed if it was present.
- `j` is `m`.
- `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` (after any removal) is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0.
- `old` is `a[r - m]`.
- `a[r]` is in `todo`.

After executing `todo.remove(a[r])`:
- The element `a[r]` is removed from the set `todo`.
- The sets `done` and `extra` remain unchanged.
- The variables `t`, `m`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `j`, `ans`, and `old` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is any integer; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is an integer provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `todo` is a set of unique integers obtained from the input with `a[r]` removed; `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo`, with adjustments based on the presence of `old`; `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo`, with `old` removed if it was present; `j` is `m`; `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` (after any removal) is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0; `old` is `a[r - m]`.**
