To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the context of the variables involved.

### Given Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is an integer greater than `m`.
- `k` is the integer provided by the input.
- `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input.
- `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input, excluding any elements that were in the sliding window and were in `todo` and then moved to `done` or `extra`.
- `done` is a set of integers that have been in the sliding window and have been moved from `todo` to `done` at least once.
- `extra` is a set containing all elements from the sliding window that were not in `todo` initially and have not been moved to `done` or `todo` during the loop.
- `j` is `m-1`.
- `ans` is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop.

### Analysis:
The variable `ans` is specifically designed to count the number of times the length of the set `done` is greater than or equal to `k` during the execution of a loop. The loop likely iterates over the list `a` using a sliding window approach, updating the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` as it goes.

### What Will Be Printed:
The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`, which is the count of occurrences where the length of the set `done` was greater than or equal to `k`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `todo`, `done`, `extra`, and the specific logic of the loop are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output precisely.

### Final Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is the count of times the length of the set `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop)**
