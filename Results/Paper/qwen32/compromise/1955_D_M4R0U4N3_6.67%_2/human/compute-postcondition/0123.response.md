The code snippet `todo.remove(a[r])` will remove the element at index `r` in the list `a` from the set `todo`. Given the initial state, `r` is `m + 1`, so the element `a[m + 1]` will be removed from `todo`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is the integer provided by the input; `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input; `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input, excluding any elements that were in the first `m` elements of `a` and were in `todo`, including `old` if `old` was in `done`, with `a[m + 1]` removed; `extra` is a set containing all elements from the first `m` elements of `a` that were not in `todo`, excluding `old` if `old` was in `extra`; `done` is a set of integers with `old` removed if `old` was in `done`; `j` is `m-1`; `r` is `m + 1`; `old` is `a[1]` and is not in `extra`; `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is less than `k`, otherwise `ans` is 2. If `old` was in `extra`, then `todo` and `extra` remain unchanged. If `old` was not in `extra`, then `old` is added to `todo` if it was in `done`, and removed from `done` if it was present.**
