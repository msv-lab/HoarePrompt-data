To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand how the variables `ans`, `done`, `todo`, and `extra` are manipulated throughout the program.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `m`: Any integer.
- `n`: An integer greater than `m`.
- `k`: An integer provided by the input.
- `a`: A list of integers obtained from the input.
- `todo`: A set of unique integers that were in `todo` initially but have been adjusted based on the last `n - m` elements of `a`.
- `done`: A set containing all elements from the last `n - m` elements of `a` that were originally in `todo`.
- `extra`: A set containing all elements from the last `n - m` elements of `a` that were not in `todo`.
- `j`: Set to `m`.
- `ans`: The number of times during the loop that the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k`.

### Analysis:
The variable `ans` is incremented each time the length of the set `done` is greater than or equal to `k` during some loop iteration. The exact value of `ans` depends on the elements in the list `a`, the initial state of the set `todo`, and the value of `k`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `todo`, and `k` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Output Description:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the number of times the length of the set `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop.

Output: **ans (where ans is the number of times the length of the set `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop)**
