The only variable in the loop head is `r`, and it is used in the `range(m, n)`. For the loop to execute, the range must be valid, meaning `m` must be less than `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `m` is the second integer provided by the input and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is the first integer provided by the input and is greater than `m`.
- `k` is the third integer provided by the input.
- `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the latest input.
- `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input with `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` removed if they were in `todo`.
- `done` is a set containing elements from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were in `todo`.
- `extra` is a set containing elements from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were not in `todo`.
- `j` is `m-1`.
- `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `m < n`. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `a`, `todo`, `done`, `extra`, `j`, and `ans`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is the second integer provided by the input and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the first integer provided by the input and must be greater than `m`; `k` is the third integer provided by the input; `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the latest input; `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input with `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` removed if they were in `todo`; `done` is a set containing elements from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were in `todo`; `extra` is a set containing elements from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were not in `todo`; `j` is `m-1`; `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0**
