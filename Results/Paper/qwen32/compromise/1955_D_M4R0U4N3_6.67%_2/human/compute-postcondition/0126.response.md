Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is the integer provided by the input; `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input; `j` is `m-1`; `r` is `m + 1`; `old` is `a[1]` and is not in `extra`; `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is less than `k`, otherwise `ans` is 2. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `a[r]` is added to `extra`. If `old` was in `extra`, then `todo` and `extra` remain unchanged. If `old` was not in `extra`, then `old` is added to `todo` if it was in `done`, and removed from `done` if it was present.**

This postcondition summarizes the changes made to the sets `todo` and `extra` based on whether `a[r]` is in `todo`, while maintaining the values of other variables as described in the precondition.
