Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `m` is the second integer provided by the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the first integer provided by the input and is greater than `m`, `k` is the third integer provided by the input, `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the latest input, `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input with `a[m-1]` removed if it was in `todo`, `done` is a set containing `a[m-1]` and `a[m]` if `a[m-1]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` is a set containing `a[m]` if `a[m]` was in `todo`, `extra` is an empty set if `a[m-1]` was in `todo`, otherwise `extra` contains `a[m-1]` and `a[m]` if `a[m]` was not in `todo`, `j` is `m`, `ans` is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop.**
