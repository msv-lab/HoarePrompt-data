The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are not specified in the initial state, but they are determined by the input. The variable `t` from the initial state is not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input.**
