Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers; `todo` is a set of unique integers; `done` is a set containing elements from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `done`, and includes `a[r]` if `a[r]` was in `todo`; `extra` is a set containing elements from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were not in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `extra`, and includes `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`; `j` is `m-1`; `old` is `a[r - m]`; `a[r]` is not in `todo`; If `old` was in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added to `todo`; If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1; `r` is `r + 1`.**
