The only variable in the loop head is `r`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `r` is less than `n`. Given that `r` starts from `m` and increments by 1 in each iteration, to execute one more iteration, `r` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

At the end of the previous iteration, `r` was `m`, `m` is any integer, `n` is an integer greater than `m`, and the loop will continue as long as `r` is less than `n`.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `r` should be `m + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is any integer; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is an integer provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `todo` is a set of unique integers obtained from the input with `a[r]` removed if `a[r]` was in `todo`; `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo` with adjustments based on the presence of `old`, and now includes `a[r]` if `a[r]` was in `todo`; `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo`, with `old` removed if it was present, and now includes `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`; `j` is `m`; `old` is `a[r - m]`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` is 1; `r` is `m + 1`**
