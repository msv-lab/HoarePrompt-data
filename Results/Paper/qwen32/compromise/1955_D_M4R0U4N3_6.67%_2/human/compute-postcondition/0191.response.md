Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers; `todo` is a set of unique integers with `a[r]` removed if `a[r]` was in `todo`, except `old` is added back to `todo` if `old` was in `done`; `done` is a set containing elements from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `done`, and includes `a[r]` if `a[r]` was in `todo`, but `old` is removed from `done`; `extra` is a set containing elements from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were not in `todo` except `old` if `old` was in `extra`, and includes `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`; `j` is `m-1`; `old` is `a[r - m]`; If `old` was in `extra`, it is not in `extra` anymore and is in `todo` if it was in `done`. If `old` was in `done`, it is not in `done` anymore and is in `todo`. Additionally, `a[r]` is not in `todo`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1; `r` is `r + 1`.**

In natural language: The element `old` (which is `a[r - m]`) has been removed from the `done` set. All other variables retain their previous values and states, except `done` no longer contains `old`.
