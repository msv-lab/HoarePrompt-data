The code snippet `done.add(a[j])` adds the element `a[j]` to the set `done`. This means that `done` will now include `a[j]` as one of its elements. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `todo`, `extra`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input with `m` greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `todo` is a set of unique integers obtained from the input except it no longer contains `a[j]`; `done` is a set containing `a[j]`; `extra` is an empty set.**
