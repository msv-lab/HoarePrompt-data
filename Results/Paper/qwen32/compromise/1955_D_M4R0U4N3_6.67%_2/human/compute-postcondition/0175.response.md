Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is the second integer provided by the input and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the first integer provided by the input and must be greater than `m`; `k` is the third integer provided by the input; `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the latest input; `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input with `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` removed if they were in `todo`; `done` is a set containing elements from `a[0] to `a[m-1]` that were in `todo` except `old`; `extra` is a set containing elements from `a[0] to `a[m-1]` that were not in `todo`; `j` is `m-1`; `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0; `old` is `a[r - m]` and `old` is not in `extra`; `old` is not in `done`.** 

In natural language: The element `old` has been removed from the set `done`. All other variables retain their initial state, except `done` which no longer includes `old`. The value of `ans` remains unchanged based on whether the length of `done` (after removing `old`) is still greater than or equal to `k`.
