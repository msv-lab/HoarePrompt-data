Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input with `m` greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `todo` is a set of unique integers obtained from the input, except it no longer contains `a[4]` if `a[4]` was in `todo`; `done` is a set containing `a[4]` if `a[4]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` is an empty set; `extra` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was not in `todo`, otherwise `extra` is an empty set, and now `extra` also contains `a[j]` if `a[j]` was not in `todo`; `j` is 4.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. The integers `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. The list `a` of integers remains the same. The set `todo` no longer contains the element `a[4]` if it was present initially. The set `done` now contains `a[4]` if it was previously in `todo`. The set `extra` remains unchanged or includes `a[4]` if it was not in `todo`. The variable `j` is still 4.
