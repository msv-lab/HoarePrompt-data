The code snippet provided is `extra.add(a[r])`, which adds the element `a[r]` to the set `extra`. Given the initial state, this operation will update the set `extra` to include the new element `a[r]` if it is not already present.

Here is the output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is any integer; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is an integer provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `todo` is a set of unique integers obtained from the input, except it no longer contains any elements that were in `a` and also in `todo`; if `old` is in `extra`, `old` is removed from `extra`. If `old` is in `done`, `old` is removed from `done` and added to `todo`; `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo`, with adjustments based on the presence of `old`; `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo`, with `old` removed if it was present, and now includes `a[r]`; `j` is `m`; `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` (after any removal) is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0; `old` is `a[r - m]`; `a[r]` is not in `todo`.**

In natural language: The set `extra` now includes the element `a[r]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
