### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by using a sliding window approach. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program works and whether it correctly solves the problem as described:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It also reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **First Window**:
   - The program initializes three sets: `todo`, `done`, and `extra`.
   - `todo` contains the elements of array `b` initially.
   - It then processes the first window of size `m` in array `a`.
   - For each element in this window, it checks if it is in `todo`. If it is, it moves the element to `done` and removes it from `todo`.
   - If the element is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`.
   - After processing the first window, it checks if the size of `done` is at least `k`. If it is, it increments the answer `ans` by 1.

3. **Sliding Window**:
   - For each subsequent element in array `a` (starting from the `m`-th element), it slides the window one position to the right.
   - It removes the element that is sliding out of the window (`old = a[r - m]`).
   - If `old` is in `extra`, it removes it from `extra`.
   - If `old` is in `done`, it removes it from `done` and adds it back to `todo`.
   - It then adds the new element (`a[r]`) into the window.
   - If `a[r]` is in `todo`, it moves `a[r]` from `todo` to `done`.
   - If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, it adds `a[r]` to `extra`.
   - After processing the new window, it checks if the size of `done` is at least `k`. If it is, it increments the answer `ans` by 1.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all windows for a test case, it prints the count `ans`.

### Issues in the Program:

The logic of the program seems correct at first glance, but there is a critical issue with the use of sets:

- **Sets Do Not Track Multiplicity**: The program uses sets to track elements in `todo`, `done`, and `extra`. However, sets do not account for the multiplicity of elements. If an element appears multiple times in `b`, the program treats it as a single element. This is incorrect because the problem requires matching at least `k` elements, and these elements can repeat.

### Correctness:

Given the issue with sets not tracking multiplicity, the program is not correctly solving the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
