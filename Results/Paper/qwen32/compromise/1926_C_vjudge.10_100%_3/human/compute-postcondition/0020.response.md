The code snippet `sum_value_digits += int(x)` adds the integer value of `x` to `sum_value_digits`. Given that `x` is "0", the integer value of `x` is 0. Therefore, `sum_value_digits` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[n + 1]` which is 0; `i` is 10; `sum_value_digits` is `sum_value_digits` + 0; `x` is "0"**.
