The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` in the loop statement `for x in str(i):`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that the loop can execute with the next character of the string representation of `i`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4)
- `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5)
- `inf` is 200001
- `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[n + 1]` which is 0
- `i` is `n + 2`
- `sum_value_digits` is `int(x)`

The loop `for x in str(i):` iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was the last digit of `i`. For the next iteration, `x` should be the next character in the string representation of `i` if there are more characters left.

Since `i` is `n + 2`, let's denote the string representation of `i` as `str(i)`. If `x` was the last digit of `i` in the previous iteration, it means we have already processed all digits of `i`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted such that `str(i)` has more than one digit, and `x` should be the first digit of this new `i`.

However, since the problem states that we are at the end of the previous iteration and `x` is already the last digit of `i`, the loop cannot execute one more time with the current `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to a value that has more than one digit.

Let's assume that `i` was a single-digit number in the previous iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to a two-digit number. The simplest adjustment would be to increment `i` to the next number that has more than one digit, which is 10.

State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[n + 1]` which is 0; `i` is 10; `sum_value_digits` is `int(x)`**

However, since the task specifies that we should only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, and the only object in the loop head is `x`, we need to consider the next character in the string representation of `i` if `i` already has more than one digit.

If `i` is `n + 2` and `n + 2` is a multi-digit number, `x` should be the next digit in the string representation of `i`. For example, if `i` was 123 and `x` was 3 in the previous iteration, `x` should be 1 in the next iteration if `i` is adjusted to 12.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `n`, we assume `i` is already a multi-digit number, and `x` should be the next digit in the string representation of `i`.

State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[n + 1]` which is 0; `i` is `n + 2`; `sum_value_digits` is `int(x)`**

Given that `x` was the last digit of `i` in the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to a value that has more than one digit, and `x` should be the first digit of this new `i`.

Since we can only adjust `x` and `i` is already defined, we assume `i` is a multi-digit number, and `x` should be the next digit in the string representation of `i`.

State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[n + 1]` which is 0; `i` is `n + 2`; `sum_value_digits` is `int(x)`**

Since `x` was the last digit of `i` in the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to a value that has more than one digit, and `x` should be the first digit of this new `i`.

Let's assume `i` is 10, and `x` should be the first digit of `i`, which is 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[n + 1]` which is 0; `i` is 10; `sum_value_digits` is 1**

Given that `x` was the last digit of `i` in the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to a value that has more than one digit, and `x` should be the first digit of this new `i`.

Since we can only adjust `x` and `i` is already defined, we assume `i` is a multi-digit number, and `x` should be the next digit in the string representation of `i`.
