The given code snippet modifies the `values` list by setting `values[i]` to the sum of `values[i - 1]` and `sum_value_digits`. Given the initial state, `i` is 11, `values[10]` is `sum_value_digits` (which is 2), and `values[i - 1]` is `values[10]`. Thus, `values[11]` will be `values[10] + sum_value_digits`, which is `2 + 2 = 4`.

Here is the output state:

Output State: **`t` remains the input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` remains a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` remains 200001; `values` remains a list of 200001 zeros except `values[n + 1]` which is 0, `values[10]` is 2, and `values[11]` is 4; `i` remains 11; `sum_value_digits` is 2.**
