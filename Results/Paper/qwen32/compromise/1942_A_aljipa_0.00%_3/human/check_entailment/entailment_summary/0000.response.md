Reasoning: 

Let's analyze the program's behavior based on the problem description and the execution summary.

1. **When `k == n`**:
   - The problem requires that all cyclic shifts of the array are sorted.
   - The simplest array that satisfies this is an array of all identical elements, such as `[1, 1, ..., 1]`.
   - The program correctly returns an array of `n` ones in this case.

2. **When `k == 1`**:
   - The problem requires that exactly one cyclic shift of the array is sorted.
   - The simplest array that satisfies this is an array that is sorted in one cyclic shift. For example, `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]` is sorted in its first cyclic shift.
   - The program correctly returns an array of integers from `0` to `n-1` in this case.

3. **When `1 < k < n`**:
   - The problem requires that exactly `k` cyclic shifts of the array are sorted.
   - The program incorrectly returns `-1` for all cases where `k` is not `1` or `n`.
   - However, there are valid arrays that can satisfy this condition. For example, for `n = 3` and `k = 2`, the array `[1, 3, 2]` has two sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 3, 2]` and `[2, 1, 3]`. The program should be able to find such an array, but it does not.

Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect because it fails to provide a valid array for cases where `1 < k < n`.

Correctness: **False**
