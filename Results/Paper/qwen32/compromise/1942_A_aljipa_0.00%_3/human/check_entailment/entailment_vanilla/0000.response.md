Let's analyze the problem and the given program step by step.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Sorted Array:** An array is sorted if each element is less than or equal to the next element.
2. **Cyclic Shifts:** A cyclic shift of an array involves rotating the array by a certain number of positions. For example, the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]` has cyclic shifts `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, `[2, 3, 4, 1]`, `[3, 4, 1, 2]`, and `[4, 1, 2, 3]`.
3. **Requirement:** We need to find an array of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted.
4. **Output:** If such an array exists, print it. Otherwise, print `-1`.

### Cases to Consider
- **k = n:** All cyclic shifts must be sorted. This can be achieved by having all elements in the array be the same, e.g., `[1, 1, 1, 1]`.
- **k = 1:** Only one cyclic shift should be sorted. This can be achieved by having a strictly decreasing or increasing sequence except for one position that breaks the order, e.g., `[69420, 69, 420]`.
- **1 < k < n:** This is a more complex case and requires a specific pattern to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. The provided solution does not handle this case.

### Program Analysis
The provided program handles only the cases where `k = n` and `k = 1`:
- **k = n:** It outputs an array with all elements being `1`, which satisfies the condition.
- **k = 1:** It outputs an array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`, which has exactly one sorted cyclic shift.
- **1 < k < n:** It outputs `-1`, indicating no solution is found.

However, the problem statement requires a solution for all values of `k` between `1` and `n`, inclusive. The provided program does not address the case where `1 < k < n`.

### Conclusion
The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `1 < k < n`. Therefore, it cannot guarantee a correct solution for all possible inputs.

**Correctness: False**
