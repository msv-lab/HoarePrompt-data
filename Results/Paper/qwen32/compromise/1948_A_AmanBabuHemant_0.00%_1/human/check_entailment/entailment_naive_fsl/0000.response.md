Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Character Set**: The problem requires the string to be made up of uppercase Latin letters (A-Z). However, the program constructs the string using the characters '1', '1', and '0', which are digits, not letters.

2. **Logic for Special Characters**: The logic in the program for determining whether a string can have exactly `n` special characters is flawed. The program incorrectly assumes that `n` must be even and constructs a string using the pattern '110'. This pattern does not guarantee that the string will have exactly `n` special characters.

3. **String Length**: The program checks if the length of the constructed string is less than 200, but it does not ensure that the string meets the requirement of having exactly `n` special characters.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

- **Input**: `n = 6`
- **Program Output**:
  ```
  YES
  110110
  ```

  In the output string "110110", the special characters are at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8. However, the string is not made up of uppercase Latin letters, and the logic for determining the number of special characters is incorrect.

To fix the program, we need to construct a string using uppercase Latin letters and ensure that the string has exactly `n` special characters. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 0:
            print('YES')
            print('')
        elif n == 1:
            print('YES')
            print('AA')
        else:
            # Construct a string with exactly n special characters
            # Example: For n = 3, the string could be "AABAC"
            s = 'A' * (n + 1) + 'B' + 'A' * (n - 1) + 'C'
            print('YES')
            print(s)

func()
```

In this corrected version:
- For `n = 1`, the string "AA" has exactly one special character.
- For `n > 1`, the string is constructed to have exactly `n` special characters using uppercase Latin letters.
