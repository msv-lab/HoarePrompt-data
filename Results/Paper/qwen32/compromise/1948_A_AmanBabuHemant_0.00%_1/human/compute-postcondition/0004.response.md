Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`. If `n` is odd, it outputs 'NO'. If `n` is even and `n // 2 * 3` is less than 200, it outputs 'YES' followed by the string '110' repeated `n // 2` times. If `n` is even and `n // 2 * 3` is 200 or more, it outputs 'NO'. The values of `t` and `n` for each test case remain unchanged.**
