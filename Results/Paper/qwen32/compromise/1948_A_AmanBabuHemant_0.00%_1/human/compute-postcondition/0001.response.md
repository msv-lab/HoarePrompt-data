In the given task, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and the variable `t`. The variable `_` is a common Python convention for a variable that we do not plan to use, and `t` is the number of iterations the loop will perform.

Given that `t` is already defined as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, the only variable in the loop head that we need to ensure is properly set is `t`. Since `t` is already within the required range, no adjustment is needed for `t` itself. The variable `_` does not need to be adjusted because it is not used within the loop body.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts is already suitable for the loop to execute as long as `t` is within the specified range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50**
