Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and m < n; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; `nabors` is 1; `aa` is a list of `n` strings (each string is a representation of the integers originally in `a`); `bb` is a list of strings; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of the elements in `bb`; `D` is a Counter object representing the final intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`. If `E[out_aa]` was initially greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is now `E[out_aa] - 1`. If `D[out_aa]` was initially greater than 0, then `D[out_aa]` remains unchanged and `E[out_aa]` is 0. If `D[out_aa]` was initially 0, then `D[out_aa]` remains 0 and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1; `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` ≥ `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0; `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]` after the current `in_aa`; `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]` after the current `out_aa`. If `E[out_aa]` was initially greater than 0, `pairs_in_D` is decremented by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1.**
