Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and lists `a` and `b`. It calculates how many times a sliding window of size `m` over list `a` can have at least `k` common elements with list `b`. The function outputs the count of such occurrences for each test case.**
