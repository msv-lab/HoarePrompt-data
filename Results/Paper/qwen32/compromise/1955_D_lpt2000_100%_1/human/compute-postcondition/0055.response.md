Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and `m < n`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; `nabors` is 1; `aa` is a list of strings; `bb` is a list of strings; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of the elements in `bb`; `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`; `C` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`; `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` ≥ `k` else it remains unchanged; `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]` after the current `in_aa`; `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]` after the current `out_aa`. If `D[out_aa]` > 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1; `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1; `pairs_in_D` is incremented by 1.** 

In natural language: The value of `pairs_in_D` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
