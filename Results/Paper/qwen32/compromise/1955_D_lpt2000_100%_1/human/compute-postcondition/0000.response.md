The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `nabors`. This means that `nabors` will now hold the integer value provided by the user input.

Given the initial state, the only change is the assignment of `nabors`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; `nabors` is an input integer.**
