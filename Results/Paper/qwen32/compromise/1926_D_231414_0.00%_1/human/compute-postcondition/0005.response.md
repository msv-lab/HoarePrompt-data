The code snippet creates an empty dictionary named `dic`. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `times`, `n`, `data`, or `check`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `times` must be greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `data` is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `check` is 2147483647, `dic` is an empty dictionary.**
