Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the given conditions: the sum of the ceiling of `y/2` and the ceiling of the adjusted `x/15`, or simpler values depending on whether `x` or `y` is zero.**
