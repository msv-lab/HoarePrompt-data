`ap` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `t`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `ap` is an input integer.**
