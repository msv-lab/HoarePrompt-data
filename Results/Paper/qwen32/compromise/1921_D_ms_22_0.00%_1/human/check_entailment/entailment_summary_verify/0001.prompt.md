You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of two lists of integers, `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates the total accumulated sum of the maximum distances between each element in list `a` and the closest elements in list `b`, considering both the smallest and largest elements in `b` as potential closest points. The function outputs the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the solution is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
Vasya wants to create an array `c` of length `n` from `m` given integers `b` such that the total difference `D = Σ|a_i - c_i|` is maximized.

### Strategy:
To maximize the total difference, Vasya should ideally pair each element `a_i` with the largest or smallest possible element from `b` that hasn't been used yet. This is because the absolute difference `|a_i - b_j|` is maximized when `b_j` is either the smallest or the largest possible value from `b`.

### Provided Solution Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The array `b` is sorted. This allows easy access to the smallest and largest elements of `b`.

3. **Heap Usage:**
   - A max heap (using negative values to simulate a max heap in Python) is used to keep track of the maximum possible differences for each element `a_i`.
   - For each `a_i`, the program calculates the potential differences with the smallest and largest elements of `b` and pushes the larger difference (along with `a_i` and the corresponding `b` index) into the heap.

4. **Maximizing Differences:**
   - The program pops elements from the heap and calculates the actual difference using the smallest or largest unused element from `b`.
   - It ensures that the same `b` index is not reused by maintaining pointers `tp1` and `tp2` for the smallest and largest unused elements of `b`.

5. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the total maximum difference `D`.

### Correctness:
The strategy and implementation seem correct. The program efficiently calculates the maximum possible total difference by leveraging the sorted order of `b` and a max heap to always consider the largest possible difference for each `a_i`. The use of pointers `tp1` and `tp2` ensures that each element of `b` is used at most once.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
