Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple `(-difference, i, index)`; `item` is the tuple `(-difference, i, index)` that was the smallest in the heap, which corresponds to the largest `difference` value; `diff1` is `abs(i - b[tp1])`; `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2 - 1])`; `tp2` is `tp2 - 1`; `ans` is increased by `diff2`.**

In natural language: The `ans` variable has been increased by the value of `diff2`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
