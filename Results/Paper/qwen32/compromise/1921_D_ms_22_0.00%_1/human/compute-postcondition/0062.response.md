The code snippet `ans += -item[0]` modifies the value of `ans` by adding the negation of the first element of the tuple `item` to it. Given that `item` is a tuple `(-diff, i, j)`, the value of `-item[0]` is `diff`. Therefore, `ans` is increased by `diff`.

Here is the updated output state, including all other preconditions that remain unchanged:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, and `max_heap` is a heap of tuples `(-diff, i, j)` with at least one tuple remaining. The variable `ans` has been increased by `diff`.**
