The loop condition for the `while` loop is `while max_heap:`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `max_heap` is not empty.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `max_heap` contains at least one tuple `(-difference, i, index)` (one less than before).
- `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` are defined as per their descriptions.
- `item` is the tuple `(-difference, i, index)` that was the smallest in `max_heap`.

Since `max_heap` contains at least one tuple at the end of the previous iteration, but it is stated that it contains one less tuple than before, it implies that one tuple was removed from `max_heap` during the last iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `max_heap` must still contain at least one tuple.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the other variables because the loop condition only depends on `max_heap` being non-empty. The state of `max_heap` should be adjusted to ensure it still contains at least one tuple.

State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple `(-difference, i, index)`**
