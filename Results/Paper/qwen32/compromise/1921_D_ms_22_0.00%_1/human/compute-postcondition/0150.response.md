The code calculates the absolute difference between the second element of the tuple `item` and the element at index `tp1` in the list `b`. This value is assigned to the variable `diff1`.

Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple `(-difference, i, index)` after the smallest element has been removed; `item` is the removed tuple `(-difference, i, index)` with the largest `difference`; `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`.**

In natural language, after executing the code, `max_heap` still contains tuples with the structure `(-difference, i, index)` and `item` retains its value as the tuple with the largest `difference` that was removed. Additionally, `diff1` now holds the calculated absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`.
