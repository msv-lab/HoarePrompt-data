The code snippet provided is `tp2 -= 1`, which decrements the value of `tp2` by 1. Given the initial state, the value of `tp2` is `m - 1`. After decrementing, the new value of `tp2` will be `m - 2`.

All other variables remain unchanged. Here is the output state:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 2`, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `diff`, `max_heap` is a heap of tuples `(-diff, i, j)` with the largest `diff` removed, `item` is the tuple `(-diff, i, j)` that was removed from `max_heap`, and `item[2]` is not less than `tp1` and not greater than `tp2`. Additionally, `item[2]` is not equal to `tp1`.**
