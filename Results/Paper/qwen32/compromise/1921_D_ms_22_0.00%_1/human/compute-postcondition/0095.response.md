The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of the sorted list `b` and assigns it to `diff2`.

Given the initial state:
- `max_heap` is empty, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`

The only variable that changes value due to the code execution is `diff2`, which is set to `abs(i - b[m - 1])`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`max_heap` is empty, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`**
