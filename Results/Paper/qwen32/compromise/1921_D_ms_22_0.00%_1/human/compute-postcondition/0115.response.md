The code `item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)` removes and returns the smallest element from the `max_heap` (which contains tuples of the form `(-difference, i, index)`). Since `max_heap` is a max heap based on the negative difference, the smallest element in terms of the heap property is the one with the largest `difference`.

After this operation:
- `max_heap` will have one less element.
- `item` will hold the tuple that was the smallest in the heap, i.e., the tuple with the largest `difference`.

The other variables (`tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple `(-difference, i, index)` (one less than before), `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element read from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `item` is the tuple `(-difference, i, index)` that was the smallest in `max_heap`.**
