The code snippet `diff1 = abs(i - b[0])` calculates the absolute difference between the variable `i` and the first element of the sorted list `b`. The variable `diff1` is introduced and assigned this value. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the only new variable introduced is `diff1`, which is the absolute difference between `i` and the smallest element in `b` (since `b` is sorted in ascending order).

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each split substring to an integer (and `a` must have at least one element), `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting a new input string, converting each split substring to an integer, and sorting the resulting list in ascending order, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`.**
