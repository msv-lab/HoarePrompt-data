Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple `(-difference, i, index)`; `item` is the tuple `(-difference, i, index)` that was the smallest in the heap, which corresponds to the largest `difference` value; `diff1` is `abs(i - b[tp1])`; `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`.**

Explanation: The value of `diff2` is calculated as the absolute difference between the second element of `item` (which is `i`) and `b[tp2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
