The code snippet `item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)` removes and returns the smallest element from the `max_heap` based on the heap property. Since the elements in `max_heap` are tuples of the form `(-diff, i, j)`, the smallest element (which is the largest `diff` due to the negative sign) is popped.

Let's break down the changes:
- `item` will hold the tuple `(-diff, i, j)` that was at the root of the heap, which corresponds to the largest `diff`.
- The structure of `max_heap` is altered as a result of the pop operation, but the precondition that it contains tuples `(-diff, i, j)` for each element `i` in `a` remains valid.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `max_heap` is a heap of tuples `(-diff, i, j)` with the largest `diff` removed, `item` is the tuple `(-diff, i, j)` that was removed from `max_heap`.**
