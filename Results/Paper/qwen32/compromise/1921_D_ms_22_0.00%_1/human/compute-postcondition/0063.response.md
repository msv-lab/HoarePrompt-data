Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, and `max_heap` is a heap of tuples `(-diff, i, j)` with at least one tuple remaining. The variable `ans` has been increased by `diff`. `tp1` has been increased by 1.**

In simple terms: The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The variable `tp1` is incremented by 1.
