The code snippet provided sets the variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect any other variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`max_heap` is empty, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.**
