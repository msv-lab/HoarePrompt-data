The `while` loop in the given code will execute as long as `max_heap` is not empty. Therefore, to ensure that the first iteration of the loop can proceed, `max_heap` must contain at least one element.

Given the state right before the `while` loop:
- `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99
- `n` and `m` are input integers
- `a` is a list of integers
- `b` is a sorted list of integers
- `tp1` is 0
- `tp2` is `m - 1`
- `ans` is 0
- `max_heap` contains tuples `(-diff, i, j)` for each element `i` in `a`, where `diff` is the maximum of `abs(i - b[0])` and `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and `j` is either 0 or `m - 1` depending on whether `diff` is `abs(i - b[0])` or `abs(i - b[m - 1])`

To ensure that `max_heap` is not empty, we need to make sure that `a` contains at least one element. This will ensure that `max_heap` is populated with at least one tuple.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, and `max_heap` contains tuples `(-diff, i, j)` for each element `i` in `a`, where `diff` is the maximum of `abs(i - b[0])` and `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and `j` is either 0 or `m - 1` depending on whether `diff` is `abs(i - b[0])` or `abs(i - b[m - 1])`.**
