Given the initial state:
- `max_heap` is empty.
- `tp1` and `tp2` are final pointers in `b`.
- `ans` is the total accumulated sum of the maximum distances.

The task is to determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement.

From the provided information:
- `max_heap` being empty does not directly affect the value of `ans`.
- `tp1` and `tp2` are described as final pointers in `b`, but there is no information about the list `b` or how `tp1` and `tp2` are used.
- `ans` is described as the total accumulated sum of the maximum distances, but no operations or values that contribute to `ans` are provided.

Since the exact value of `ans` is not provided or derived from the given information, we can only describe it based on the given precondition.

Output: **ans (where ans is the total accumulated sum of the maximum distances)**
