Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
1. `max_heap` is empty.
2. `t` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by `n`.
3. `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.
4. `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
5. `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.
6. `tp1` is `m`.
7. `tp2` is `0`.
8. `ans` is the total accumulated difference.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Analysis:
- From the initial state, we know that `ans` is the total accumulated difference. However, the specific value of `ans` is not provided directly in the initial state. 
- The problem does not provide the exact values of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`, nor does it show any operations that modify `ans` before the `print` statement is executed.
- Therefore, the value of `ans` is described as the total accumulated difference, but we do not have enough information to determine its exact numerical value.

### Conclusion:
The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`, which is described as the total accumulated difference.

Output: **ans (where ans is the total accumulated difference)**
