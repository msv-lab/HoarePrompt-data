The code snippet pushes a tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` onto the `max_heap`. This means that the `max_heap` will now contain this tuple as its first element since it was initially empty. The values of `diff2`, `i`, and `m - 1` are directly taken from the initial state. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `max_heap` is a list containing `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`**.
