Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, and `max_heap` contains tuples `(-diff, i, j)` for each element `i` in `a`, where `diff` is the maximum of `abs(i - b[0])` and `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and `j` is either 0 or `m - 1` depending on whether `diff` is `abs(i - b[0])` or `abs(i - b[m - 1])`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing for all elements in list `a`, the `max_heap` will contain tuples for each element `i` in `a`. Each tuple will have the form `(-diff, i, j)`, where `diff` is the larger of the two differences `abs(i - b[0])` and `abs(i - b[m - 1])`. The value of `j` will be `0` if `diff` is `abs(i - b[0])`, or `m - 1` if `diff` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans`) will remain unchanged from their initial states.
