Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple `(-difference, i, index)` after the smallest element has been removed; `item` is the removed tuple `(-difference, i, index)` with the largest `difference`; `ans` is increased by `difference`; `tp2` is decreased by 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `tp2` has been decreased by 1. All other variables (`max_heap`, `item`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
