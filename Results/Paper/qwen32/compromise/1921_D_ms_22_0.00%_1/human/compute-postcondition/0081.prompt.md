Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, and `max_heap` contains tuples `(-diff, i, j)` for each element `i` in `a`, where `diff` is the maximum of `abs(i - b[0])` and `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and `j` is either 0 or `m - 1` depending on whether `diff` is `abs(i - b[0])` or `abs(i - b[m - 1])`.
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, and `max_heap` is a heap of tuples `(-diff, i, j)` with the largest `diff` removed. The tuple `item` is the tuple `(-diff, i, j)` that was removed from `max_heap`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `diff1` is calculated as `abs(item[1] - b[tp1 - 1])` if `diff1 > diff2` else `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`, `tp1` is updated to `tp1 + 1` if `diff1 > diff2` else 0, `tp2` is updated to `m - 1` if `diff1 > diff2` else `m - 2`, and `ans` is updated to `diff1` if `diff1 > diff2` else `ans + diff2`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to the previous value of `ans` plus `diff`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` is updated to 1. Otherwise, `tp1` remains 0 and `tp2` is updated to `m - 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, and `max_heap` is a heap of tuples `(-diff, i, j)` with at least one tuple remaining. The variable `ans` has been increased by either `diff1` or `diff` depending on the condition. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff1` is calculated as `abs(item[1] - b[tp1 - 1])` if `diff1 > diff2`, otherwise `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`. `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`. If `diff1 > diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is updated by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is updated by `diff2`. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, `tp1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is updated by `diff`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, and `max_heap` is a heap of tuples `(-diff, i, j)` with at least one tuple remaining. The variable `item` is assigned the value of the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff1` is calculated as `abs(item[1] - b[tp1 - 1])` if `diff1 > diff2`, otherwise `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`. `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`. If `diff1 > diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is updated by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is updated by `diff2`. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, `tp1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is updated by `-item[0]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
