Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `max_heap` is a heap of tuples `(-diff, i, j)` with the largest `diff` removed, `item` is the tuple `(-diff, i, j)` that was removed from `max_heap`, `item[2]` is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1 - 1])` if `diff1 > diff2` else `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`, `tp1` is `tp1 + 1` if `diff1 > diff2` else 0, `tp2` is `m - 1` if `diff1 > diff2` else `m - 2`, and `ans` is `diff1` if `diff1 > diff2` else `ans + diff2`.**
