The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `b`. The values of `max_heap`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, and `a` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`max_heap` is empty, `tp1` and `tp2` are final pointers in `b`, `ans` is the total accumulated sum of the maximum distances, `t` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input.**
