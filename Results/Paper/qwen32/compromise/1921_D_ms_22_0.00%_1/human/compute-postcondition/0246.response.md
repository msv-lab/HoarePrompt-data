Postcondition: **`t` is 0, `max_heap` is empty, `tp1` and `tp2` are final pointers in `b`, and `ans` is the total accumulated sum of the maximum distances for all test cases. If the program is executed as the main module, these conditions hold. Otherwise, the program does nothing and the state of `t`, `max_heap`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
