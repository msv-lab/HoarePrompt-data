The code snippet `item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `max_heap` based on the heap property. Since `max_heap` contains tuples of the form `(-difference, i, index)`, the smallest element will be the one with the largest `difference` (because of the negative sign).

Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple `(-difference, i, index)` after the smallest element has been removed; `item` is the removed tuple `(-difference, i, index)` with the largest `difference`.**

In simpler terms, `item` now holds the tuple with the largest `difference` that was removed from `max_heap`, and `max_heap` still contains at least one tuple if it originally had more than one.
