The code snippet provided increments the variable `tp1` by 1. The other variables `max_heap`, `item`, and `ans` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple `(-difference, i, index)` after the smallest element has been removed; `item` is the removed tuple `(-difference, i, index)` with the largest `difference`; `ans` is increased by `difference`; `tp1` is increased by 1.**
