The loop head in this case is `while max_heap:`. For the loop to execute one more time, `max_heap` must contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that `max_heap` is not empty.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `max_heap` contains tuples in the form `(-diff, i, index)` for each element `i` in `a`, except for the one that was popped.
- `t` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by `n`.
- `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.
- `item` is the tuple `(-diff, i, index)` that was popped from `max_heap`.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to add at least one tuple back into `max_heap`.

State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple in the form `(-diff, i, index)`, `t` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by `n`, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.**
