The variable `diff1` is assigned the absolute value of the difference between `i` and the first element of the sorted list `b`. The values of `max_heap`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_heap` is empty, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`**.
