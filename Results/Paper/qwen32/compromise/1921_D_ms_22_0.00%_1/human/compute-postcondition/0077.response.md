Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, and `max_heap` is a heap of tuples `(-diff, i, j)` with at least one tuple remaining. The variable `ans` has been increased by the value of `-item[0]`. The variable `item` is assigned the value of the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`. `tp1` has been incremented by 1.**

In natural language: The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, `ans`, and `item` remain unchanged from their initial state, except `tp1` is now one greater than its previous value.
