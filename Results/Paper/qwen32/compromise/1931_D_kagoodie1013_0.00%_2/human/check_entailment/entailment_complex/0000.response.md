### Reasoning:

The given program aims to find the number of beautiful pairs in an array for multiple test cases. A pair of indices \((i, j)\) is considered beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The program processes each test case by iterating through the array and maintaining two dictionaries:
- `mod_x_map` to count occurrences of numbers with the same remainder when divided by \(x\).
- `mod_y_map` to count occurrences of numbers with the same remainder when divided by \(y\).

For each number in the array, the program calculates:
- `mod_x`: the remainder of the negative of the number when divided by \(x\).
- `mod_y`: the remainder of the number when divided by \(y\).

The count of beautiful pairs is incremented by the sum of the counts of these remainders found in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`.

After processing each number, the program updates the counts in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` accordingly.

Let's verify if the logic is correct:
1. **Condition 1**: \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) can be rewritten as \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\). This is correctly handled by checking `mod_x_map` with `-num % x`.
2. **Condition 2**: \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\) can be rewritten as \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\). This is correctly handled by checking `mod_y_map` with `num % y`.

The program correctly counts the number of beautiful pairs by using these conditions.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs for each test case. The use of dictionaries to keep track of remainders ensures that the solution is efficient and works within the given constraints.
