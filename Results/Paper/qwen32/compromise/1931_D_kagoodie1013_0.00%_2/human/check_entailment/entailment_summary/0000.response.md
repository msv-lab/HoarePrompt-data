### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array as described in the problem statement. However, there is a mistake in the logic of the program, which makes it incorrect.

In the program:
- It calculates `mod_x` as `-num % x` and `mod_y` as `num % y`.
- It then tries to count pairs by adding the counts of `mod_x` and `mod_y` from the maps `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`.
- The maps `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are updated with `num % x` and `num % y` respectively.

The mistake lies in the calculation of `mod_x`. The correct calculation for `mod_x` should be `num % x`, not `-num % x`. The expression `-num % x` does not represent the correct remainder when `-num` is divided by `x`. 

The logic should be:
- Calculate `mod_x` as `num % x`.
- Calculate `mod_y` as `num % y`.
- For each `num` in the array, find how many previous numbers have the same `mod_x` and `mod_y` and add those counts to `count`.
- Update `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` with the current `num % x` and `num % y`.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the wrong calculation of `mod_x`. This would lead to incorrect counts of beautiful pairs for some test cases.
