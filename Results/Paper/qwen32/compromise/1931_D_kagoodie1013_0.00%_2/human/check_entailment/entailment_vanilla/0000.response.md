Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap
We need to find the number of beautiful pairs \((i, j)\) in an array \(a\) such that:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

### Program Analysis

The program reads the input and processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it uses two dictionaries (`mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`) to keep track of the counts of specific remainders when elements of the array are divided by \(x\) and \(y\), respectively.

#### Key Points:
1. **Remainders Calculation:**
   - For each element `num` in the array, it calculates:
     - `mod_x = -num % x`
     - `mod_y = num % y`
   - It then calculates `mod_x_key = num % x` and `mod_y_key = num % y` for updating the dictionaries.

2. **Counting Beautiful Pairs:**
   - For each element `num`, it increments the count by the sum of the current counts in `mod_x_map` for `mod_x` and in `mod_y_map` for `mod_y`.
   - It updates `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` with the new counts for `mod_x_key` and `mod_y_key`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Remainder Calculation:**
   - The program calculates `mod_x` as `-num % x`, which is not the correct approach to find the remainder when `-num` is divided by `x`.
   - To find the correct remainder, we should use `(num % x + x) % x` instead of `-num % x`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Pairs:**
   - The logic of counting pairs seems flawed. The current implementation does not correctly match pairs \((i, j)\) based on the conditions provided.
   - We need to find pairs \((i, j)\) such that:
     - \((a_i + a_j) \mod x = 0\)
     - \((a_i - a_j) \mod y = 0\)
   - This requires a more sophisticated approach, likely involving nested loops or a more nuanced use of dictionaries to track compatible remainders.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified, the program is not correctly solving the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
