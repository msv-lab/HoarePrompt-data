The code snippet appends the value of `count` to the `results` list. This means that the `results` list, which was initially empty, will now contain one element, which is the value of `count`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `count`, `mod_x_map`, `mod_y_map`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `count` is the total number of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` encountered; `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with the frequency of each `mod_x_key` in `arr`; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with the frequency of each `mod_y_key` in `arr`.**
