Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` for the processed tuple; `count` is the previous value of `count` plus the sum of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`; `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary; `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary; The current tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` is the next tuple in the list `test_cases` to be processed, and `arr` must have at least one element; `num` is the first element in `arr`; `mod_x` is `-num % x`; `mod_y` is `num % y`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `count` has been updated to its previous value plus the sum of the values retrieved from `mod_x_map` using `mod_x` as the key (defaulting to 0 if the key is not found) and from `mod_y_map` using `mod_y` as the key (defaulting to 0 if the key is not found). All other variables remain unchanged.
