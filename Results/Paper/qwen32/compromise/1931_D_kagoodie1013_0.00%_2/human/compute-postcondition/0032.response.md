Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with the frequency of each `mod_x_key` in `arr`; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with the frequency of each `mod_y_key` in `arr`. The current tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` is the next tuple in `test_cases`.**

In natural language: The variable `count` has been reset to 0. All other variables, including `test_cases`, `results`, `mod_x_map`, and `mod_y_map`, remain unchanged.
