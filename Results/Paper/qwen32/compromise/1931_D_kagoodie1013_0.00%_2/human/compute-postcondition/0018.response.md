The code snippet updates the value of `mod_y_key` to `num % y`. Given that `num` is the next element in `arr`, and `y` is part of the tuple in `test_cases`, the specific value of `mod_y_key` will now be the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0) + mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`; `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` mapped to 1; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` mapped to 1; `mod_x` is `-num % x`; `mod_y` is `num % y`; `mod_x_key` is `num % x`; `mod_y_key` is `num % y`; `num` is the next element in `arr`.** 

In natural language: The `mod_y_key` has been updated to the remainder of `num` divided by `y`. All other variables retain their previous values as described in the initial state.
