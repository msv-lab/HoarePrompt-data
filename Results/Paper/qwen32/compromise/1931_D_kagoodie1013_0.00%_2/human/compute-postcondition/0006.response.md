The provided code snippet calculates `mod_x` as `-num % x`. However, `num` is not defined in the initial state. Assuming that `num` is intended to be an element from the `arr` list within the first tuple of `test_cases`, we will proceed with this assumption. 

Given the initial state, the first tuple in `test_cases` contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. Let's denote the first element of `arr` as `num`. Therefore, `mod_x` will be calculated based on the first element of the `arr` list in the first tuple of `test_cases`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `x` (1 <= x <= 10^9), `y` (1 <= y <= 10^9), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers where each integer is 1 <= a_i <= 10^9), and `test_cases` must not be empty; the first tuple in `test_cases` must have an `arr` with at least one element; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary; `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary; `mod_x` is `-test_cases[0][3][0] % test_cases[0][1]`.**
