The code snippet `mod_x_key = num % x` updates the value of `mod_x_key` to be the result of `num % x`. Since `num` is the first element in `arr` and `x` is part of the current tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`, the new value of `mod_x_key` will be the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.

Other variables remain unchanged, including `test_cases`, `results`, `count`, `mod_x_map`, `mod_y_map`, `n`, `y`, `arr`, `mod_x`, and `mod_y`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` for the processed tuple; `count` is the previous value of `count` plus the sum of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`; `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary; `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary; The current tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` is the next tuple in the list `test_cases` to be processed, and `arr` must have at least one element; `num` is the first element in `arr`; `mod_x` is `-num % x`; `mod_y` is `num % y`; `mod_x_key` is `num % x`.**
