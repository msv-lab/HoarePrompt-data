Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary; `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary; The current tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` is the next tuple in `test_cases` and `arr` must have at least one element; `num` is the first element of `arr`; `mod_x` is `-num % x`; `mod_y` is `num % y`.**

In this output state, `mod_y` is now assigned the value of `num % y`, while all other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
