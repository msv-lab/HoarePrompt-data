The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`, and the iterable is `arr`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least one element, the loop can execute. The state of `test_cases`, `results`, `count`, `mod_x_map`, and `mod_y_map` does not directly affect the execution of this specific for loop.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element. Since `test_cases` is a list of tuples and each tuple contains `arr` as one of its elements, we need to ensure that the first tuple in `test_cases` has an `arr` with at least one element.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `x` (1 <= x <= 10^9), `y` (1 <= y <= 10^9), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers where each integer is 1 <= a_i <= 10^9), and `test_cases` must not be empty; the first tuple in `test_cases` must have an `arr` with at least one element; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary; `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary**.
