The given code updates the value of `dp[i]` based on the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. Let's compute the new value of `dp[i]` using the initial state provided.

Given:
- `i` is 4
- `dp[1]` is 1
- `dp[2]` is 3
- `dp[3]` is 7

Using the formula:
`dp[4] = (dp[3] + (4 - 1) * dp[2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
`dp[4] = (7 + 3 * 3 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
`dp[4] = (7 + 18) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
`dp[4] = 25 % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
`dp[4] = 25`

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer such that `n - num >= 3`, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is the cumulative sum of increments (1 or 2) over `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num` and `m` must be at least 4, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros with `dp[1]` set to 1, `dp[2]` set to 3, `dp[3]` set to 7, and `dp[4]` set to 25, `i` is 4**.
