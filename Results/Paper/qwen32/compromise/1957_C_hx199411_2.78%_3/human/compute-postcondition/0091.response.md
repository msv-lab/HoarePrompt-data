The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. This affects the values of `c` and `r`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` must be greater than 0, `num` is 0, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros with `dp[1]` set to 1, `dp[2]` set to 3, `dp[3] set to 7, `dp[4]` set to 25, and `dp[5]` set to 81 if `m` is at least 5, `c` is the second integer read from the input, `r` is the third integer read from the input.**
