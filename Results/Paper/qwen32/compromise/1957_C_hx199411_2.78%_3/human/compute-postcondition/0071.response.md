Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

- `t` is `t - 1`: This indicates that `t` has been decremented by 1, but its initial value is not specified.
- `n` is the first integer read from the input: This means `n` holds the value of the first integer provided as input.
- `k` is the second integer read from the input: This means `k` holds the value of the second integer provided as input.
- `num` is the cumulative sum of increments (1 or 2) over `k` iterations: This means `num` is the result of adding either 1 or 2, `k` times.
- `m` is `n - num`: This means `m` is the difference between `n` and `num`.
- The current value of `m` is 1: This tells us that after performing the operations described above, `m` equals 1.

However, the print statement is:
```python
print(1)
```

This print statement directly outputs the integer `1`, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, or `m`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply the number 1.

Output: **1**
