The code snippet `num += 2` increments the value of `num` by 2. Given the initial state, `num` was initially 0. After the increment, `num` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `num` is 2, `m` is `n - num`, `c` is the first integer read from the second input pair, `r` is the second integer read from the second input pair, and `c` is not equal to `r`.**
