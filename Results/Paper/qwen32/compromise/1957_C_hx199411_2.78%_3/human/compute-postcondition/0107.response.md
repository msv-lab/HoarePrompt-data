To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we need to consider how the loop modifies the variables based on the provided information.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is at least 1 and has been decremented by 1.
- `n` is the first integer read from the input.
- `k` is the second integer read from the input.
- `num` is 0.
- `m` is `n - num`.
- `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros with `dp[1]` set to 1, `dp[2]` set to 3, `dp[3]` set to 7, `dp[4]` set to 25, and `dp[5]` set to 81 if `m` is at least 5.
- `i` is 6 (though `i` is not used in the loop).

### Loop Execution Details:
The loop runs `k` times, and each iteration involves reading two integers `c` and `r`. Depending on whether `c` equals `r`, `num` is incremented by 1 or 2.

### Output States After Iterations:
- **After 1 iteration**: `num` is 1 if `c == r`, otherwise `num` is 2.
- **After 2 iterations**: `num` is 2 if `c == r` both times, otherwise it could be 4 (if `c != r` both times) or 3 (if `c == r` once and `c != r` once).
- **After 3 iterations**: `num` can be 3 (if `c == r` three times), 4 (if `c == r` twice and `c != r` once), or 6 (if `c != r` three times).

### Generalizing for All Iterations:
After `k` iterations, `num` will be the sum of 1s and 2s based on the number of times `c` equals `r` versus when it does not. Let's denote:
- `x` as the number of times `c == r`.
- `y` as the number of times `c != r`.

We know that `x + y = k`. The value of `num` after `k` iterations will be:
\[ \text{num} = x \cdot 1 + y \cdot 2 = x + 2y \]

Since `x + y = k`, we can substitute `y` with `k - x`:
\[ \text{num} = x + 2(k - x) = x + 2k - 2x = 2k - x \]

Thus, `num` will be `2k - x`, where `x` is the number of times `c == r` during the `k` iterations.

### Final Output State:
- `t` remains at least 0.
- `n` remains the first integer read from the input.
- `k` remains the second integer read from the input.
- `num` is `2k - x`, where `x` is the number of times `c == r` during the `k` iterations.
- `m` is updated to `n - num`.
- `dp` remains a list of `m + 1` zeros with `dp[1]` set to 1, `dp[2]` set to 3, `dp[3]` set to 7, `dp[4]` set to 25, and `dp[5]` set to 81 if `m` is at least 5.
- `i` remains 6 (unchanged by the loop).

### Final Output State in Required Format:
Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is `2k - x` where `x` is the number of times `c == r` during the `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros with `dp[1]` set to 1, `dp[2]` set to 3, `dp[3]` set to 7, `dp[4]` set to 25, and `dp[5]` set to 81 if `m` is at least 5, `i` is 6.**
