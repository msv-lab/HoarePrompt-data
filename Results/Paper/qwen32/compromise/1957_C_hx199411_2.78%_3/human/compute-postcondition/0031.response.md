The code initializes a list `dp` with `m + 1` elements, all set to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `k` is the second integer read from the input, such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`; `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on whether `c` equals `r` in each of the `k` iterations; `m` is `n - num` and `m` is not equal to 0; `m` is not equal to 1; `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.**
