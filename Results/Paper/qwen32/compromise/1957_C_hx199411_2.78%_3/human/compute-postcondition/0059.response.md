Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `c` and `r` are the new integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `num` is 3 if `c` equals `r` (which cannot happen in this branch), otherwise `num` is 4. In both cases, `m` is `n - num`.** 

To simplify and clarify, the postcondition can be summarized as:
Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `c` and `r` are the new integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is 2 or 3, and `m` is `n - num`. If `c` does not equal `r`, `num` is 4, and `m` is `n - num`.**
