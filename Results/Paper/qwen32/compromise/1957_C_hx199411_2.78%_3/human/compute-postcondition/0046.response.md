The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. This means the values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input, while other variables like `t`, `num`, and `m` remain unchanged unless they are explicitly modified later in the code.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `k` is the second integer read from the input, such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`
- `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on whether `c` equals `r` in each of the `k` iterations
- `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, no further action is specified. If `m` is 1, a specific action for `m == 1` is executed. Otherwise, `dp[m]` holds the final computed value after all iterations.

After executing the code snippet:
- `n` is now the first integer read from the input.
- `k` is now the second integer read from the input.

All other variables (`t`, `num`, `m`) retain their original values as they are not modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on whether `c` equals `r` in each of the `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num`.**
