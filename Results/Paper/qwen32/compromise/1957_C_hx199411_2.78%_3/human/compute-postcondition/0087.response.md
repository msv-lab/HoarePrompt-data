Output State: **`t` is at least 1 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is the cumulative sum of increments (1 or 2) over `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, no additional changes are made. If `m` is 1, no additional changes are made. If `m` is at least 5, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros with `dp[1]` set to 1, `dp[2]` set to 3, `dp[3]` set to 7, `dp[4]` set to 25, and `dp[5]` set to 81, and `i` is 6.**

In simpler terms, `t` has been decreased by 1 while all other variables remain unchanged.
