The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an input integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\). For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is adjusted to be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `k` is the second integer read from the input, such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`; `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on whether `c` equals `r` in each of the `k` iterations; `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, no further action is specified. If `m` is 1, a specific action for `m == 1` is executed. Otherwise, `dp[m]` holds the final computed value after all iterations.**
