The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is `t - 1`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 before the decrement operation. Therefore, `t` should be at least 1 at the start of the current iteration.

No other states need to be adjusted because they do not affect the condition of the `while` loop.

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is the cumulative sum of increments (1 or 2) over `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, no additional changes are made. If `m` is 1, no additional changes are made. If `m` is at least 5, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros with `dp[1]` set to 1, `dp[2]` set to 3, `dp[3]` set to 7, `dp[4]` set to 25, and `dp[5]` set to 81, and `i` is 6.**
