To determine the new state after executing the given line of code, we need to focus on the changes made to the `dp` list. Specifically, `dp[i]` is updated based on the formula provided.

Given:
- `i` is 5.
- `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros with `dp[1]` set to 1, `dp[2]` set to 3, `dp[3]` set to 7, and `dp[4]` set to 25.

The formula to update `dp[i]` is:
\[ dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ dp[5] = (dp[4] + (5 - 1) \times dp[3] \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[5] = (25 + 4 \times 7 \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[5] = (25 + 56) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[5] = 81 \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[5] = 81 \]

Thus, the only change is that `dp[5]` is now 81. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer such that `n - num >= 3`, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is the cumulative sum of increments (1 or 2) over `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num` and `m` must be at least 4, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros with `dp[1]` set to 1, `dp[2]` set to 3, `dp[3]` set to 7, `dp[4]` set to 25, and `dp[5]` set to 81, `i` is 5**.
