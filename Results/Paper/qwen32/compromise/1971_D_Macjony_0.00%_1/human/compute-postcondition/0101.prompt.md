Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, and for each test case, `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length 1 ≤ |`s`| ≤ 500.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    s = input()
    count = 1
    flag = False
    j = 0
    while j < len(s) - 1:
        if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
            count += 1
            if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                flag = True
                j += 1
        j += 1
    if flag:
        count -= 1
    print(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is the input string; `count` is the number of transitions between different characters in the string, minus 1 if `flag` is True; `flag` is True if there is at least one '01' sequence in the string, otherwise False; `j` is `len(s) - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the same input integer, `s` is the same input string, `count` is the number of character transitions in `s`, `flag` is True if there is at least one '01' in `s`, `j` is `len(s) - 1`, `i` is the same as initially calculated. If `flag` is True, `count` reflects the number of character transitions in `s` accurately.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the same input integer, `s` is the same input string, `count` is the number of transitions between different characters in `s` minus 1 if `flag` is True, otherwise `count` remains unchanged, `flag` is True indicating there is at least one '01' transition in `s` if it was True initially, `j` is `len(s) - 1`, and `i` is the initially calculated value plus 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
