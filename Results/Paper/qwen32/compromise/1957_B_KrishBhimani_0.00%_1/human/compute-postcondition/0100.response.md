To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `while k:`. This loop will execute as long as `k` is a non-zero value.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
- `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of the original `l1`
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of the original `l1`
- `k0` is the integer value of the second element of the original `l1`
- `arr` is an empty list
- `c` is `n`
- `ans` is `[1 << arr[0], 1 << arr[1], ..., 1 << arr[n-1], k0 - sum(ans)]`
- `i` is 0

The critical variable here is `k`. For the `while` loop to execute, `k` must be non-zero. Currently, `k` is the integer value of the second element of the original `l1`. Since `k` is derived from the input, we need to ensure that the input is such that `k` is non-zero.

Given that `k` is already defined as the integer value of the second element of `l1`, the only way to ensure that the loop executes is to make sure that `k` is non-zero. Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed to the state other than ensuring that the input results in a non-zero `k`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the original `l1`, `k` is a non-zero integer value of the second element of the original `l1`, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of the original `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `c` is `n`, `ans` is `[1 << arr[0], 1 << arr[1], ..., 1 << arr[n-1], k0 - sum(ans)]`, `i` is 0**
