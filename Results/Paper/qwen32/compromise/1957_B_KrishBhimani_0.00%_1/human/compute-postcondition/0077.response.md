Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 1, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is [0], `c` is 1, `ans` remains [] if `c` was less than `n - 1` or `ans` is [k0] and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `c` was equal to `n - 1`.**

In simpler terms, `c` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged unless `c` was already equal to `n - 1`, in which case `ans` is set to `[k0]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
