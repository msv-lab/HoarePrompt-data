The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `arr`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in `arr` and the variable `i`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last element of `arr`, and `arr` is `[0, 1]`. Since the loop iterates over the elements of `arr`, the loop will execute once for each element in `arr`.

- After the first iteration, `i` would have been `0`, and after the second iteration, `i` would have been `1`.
- Since `arr` has only two elements (`0` and `1`), the loop will not execute again after `i` has been `1`.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted further for the loop to execute another iteration because the loop will terminate after the current iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 1, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is `[0, 1]`, `c` is 2. If `c` was less than `n - 1`, `ans` is `[1 << i, 1 << i]`. If `c` was equal to `n - 1`, `ans` is `[k0, 1 << i, -(1 << i), 1 << i]`. The loop will terminate after this iteration as `i` has iterated over all elements in `arr`.**
