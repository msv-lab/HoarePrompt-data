The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is the result of `k` divided by 2 (integer division). For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than 0 after this division.

Given that `k` is divided by 2 in each iteration, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `k` must be at least 1 before the division (since 1 divided by 2 is 0, which would terminate the loop).

Therefore, to make sure the loop can execute one more time, `k` must be set to a value that is at least 2 before the division (since 2 divided by 2 is 1, which keeps the loop running).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` must be at least 2, `k0` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `ans` is [2, -2], and `c` is 2. If `k` (before the shift) is odd, `arr` is [0, 1]. Otherwise, `arr` is [1].**
