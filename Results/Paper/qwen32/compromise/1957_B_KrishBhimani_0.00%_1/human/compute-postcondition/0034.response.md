The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only exits the innermost loop or if statement it is placed within. Therefore, the values of all the variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is 1, `arr` is [0, 1], `i` is 1, `c` is `c + 1`, and `ans` is `[1, 2, -2]` if `c` was `n - 1` before the if statement, otherwise `ans` is `[2, -1]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
