The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `l1`. The value of `t` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace.**
