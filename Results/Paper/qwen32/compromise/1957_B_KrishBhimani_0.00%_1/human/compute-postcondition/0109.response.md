The code snippet `k = k >> 1` performs a right bitwise shift on the variable `k`. This operation effectively divides `k` by 2, discarding any remainder. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
- `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of the original `l1`
- `k` is greater than 0
- `k0` is the integer value of the second element of the original `l1`
- `arr` is `[0, 1]` if `k & 1 == 1`, otherwise `arr` is `[0]`
- `c` is `n`
- `ans` is `[1 << arr[0], 1 << arr[1], ..., 1 << arr[n-1], k0 - sum(ans)]`
- `i` is 1

After executing `k = k >> 1`, the value of `k` is now `k // 2` (integer division by 2).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the original `l1`, `k` is `k // 2`, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of the original `l1`, `arr` is `[0, 1]` if `k & 1 == 1`, otherwise `arr` is `[0]`, `c` is `n`, `ans` is `[1 << arr[0], 1 << arr[1], ..., 1 << arr[n-1], k0 - sum(ans)]`, and `i` is 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `k` is halved, and all other variables retain their initial state.
