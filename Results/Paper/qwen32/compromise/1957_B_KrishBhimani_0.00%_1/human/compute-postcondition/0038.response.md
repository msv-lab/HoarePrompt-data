The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the iterable `arr`. Since the loop iterates over `arr`, we need to adjust `i` to the next value in `arr` for the loop to execute again.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
- `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`
- `k` is 0
- `k0` is 1
- `arr` is [0, 1]
- `i` is 1
- `c` is `c + 1`
- If `c` was `n - 1` before the if statement, `ans` is `[1, 2, -2, 2]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is `[2, -1, 2]`.

Since `arr` is `[0, 1]` and `i` was `1` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will not execute again because there are no more elements in `arr` to iterate over.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which would not occur) would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is 1, `arr` is [0, 1], `i` is 1, `c` is `c + 1`, `ans` is `[2, -1, 2]`**

However, since the loop does not execute again, the final state before the loop terminates is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is 1, `arr` is [0, 1], `i` is 1, `c` is `c + 1`, `ans` is `[2, -1, 2]`**
