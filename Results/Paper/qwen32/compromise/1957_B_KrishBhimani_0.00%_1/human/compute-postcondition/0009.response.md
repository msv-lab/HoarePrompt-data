Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace where the second element must be a non-zero integer; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; if `k` is odd, `arr` is a list containing the integer 0; otherwise, `arr` remains an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `i` is 0.**
