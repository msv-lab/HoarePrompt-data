The code snippet `ans.append(1 << i)` appends the result of the bitwise left shift operation `1 << i` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` is either `[]` or `[k0]` depending on the value of `c` relative to `n - 1`. The variable `i` is not mentioned in the initial state, so its value is unknown.

Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for `1 << i`. However, we can describe the operation and its impact on `ans`.

If `c` was less than `n - 1`, `ans` was initially `[]`. After the operation, `ans` will be `[1 << i]`.

If `c` was equal to `n - 1`, `ans` was initially `[k0]`. After the operation, `ans` will be `[k0, 1 << i]`.

The values of other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `arr`, `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 1, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is [0], `c` is 1, `ans` is either `[1 << i]` if `c` was less than `n - 1`, or `[k0, 1 << i]` if `c` was equal to `n - 1`.**
