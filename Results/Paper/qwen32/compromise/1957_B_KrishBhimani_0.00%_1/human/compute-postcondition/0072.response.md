The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop will execute if `arr` contains at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that `arr` is not empty.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `arr` contains at least one index where the bits of the original `k` were 1. Since `k` is initially 0, `arr` will be an empty list. To make sure the loop executes, we need to change `k` such that its binary representation has at least one bit set to 1. 

Let's assume we change `k` to 1, which means `arr` will be `[0]` because the binary representation of 1 is `1`, and the bit at index 0 is 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 1, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is [0], `ans` is [], and `c` is 0**
