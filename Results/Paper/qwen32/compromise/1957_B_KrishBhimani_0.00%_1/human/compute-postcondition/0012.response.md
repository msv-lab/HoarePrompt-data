The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is non-zero, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is the integer value of `k0 // 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be non-zero. Therefore, `k0` must have been an even number greater than 1 in the previous iteration, ensuring `k` remains non-zero.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace where the second element must be a non-zero integer; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of `k0 // 2` and `k` must be non-zero; if `k0` is odd, `arr` is a list containing the integer 0; otherwise, `arr` remains an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k0`; `i` is 1**
