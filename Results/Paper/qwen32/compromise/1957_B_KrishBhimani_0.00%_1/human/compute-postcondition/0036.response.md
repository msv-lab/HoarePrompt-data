The code snippet `c += 1` increments the value of the variable `c` by 1. Given the initial state, `c` is incremented from its previous value.

Let's consider the two possible cases for the value of `c` before the increment:
1. If `c` was `n - 1` before the increment, after the increment, `c` becomes `n`. In this case, `ans` is `[1, 2, -2]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
2. If `c` was not `n - 1` before the increment, after the increment, `c` becomes `c + 1`. In this case, `ans` is `[2, -1]`.

However, the problem statement does not specify the exact value of `c` before the increment, except for the special case when `c` is `n - 1`. Therefore, we will consider the general case where `c` is incremented by 1, and the special case where `c` becomes `n` and the loop breaks.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is 1, `arr` is [0, 1], `i` is 1, `c` is `c + 1`. If `c` was `n - 1` before the if statement, `ans` is `[1, 2, -2]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is `[2, -1]`.**
