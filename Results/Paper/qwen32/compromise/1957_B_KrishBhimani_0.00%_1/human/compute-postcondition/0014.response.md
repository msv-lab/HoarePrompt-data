Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of `k0 // 2` and `k` must be non-zero; `k0` is equal to `k0`; `i` is 1; `arr` is either `[1]` if `k0` is odd, or `arr` remains an empty list if `k0` is even.**
