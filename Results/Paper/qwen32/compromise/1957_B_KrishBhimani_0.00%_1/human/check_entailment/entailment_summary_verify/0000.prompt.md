You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        arr = []
        k0 = k
        i = 0
        while k:
            if k & 1 == 1:
                arr.append(i)
            k = k >> 1
            i += 1
        ans = []
        c = 0
        for i in arr:
            if c == n - 1:
                ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
                break
            c += 1
            ans.append(1 << i)
        ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
        print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it generates a list of length `n` where each element is either a power of 2 corresponding to a set bit in `k` or `0`, ensuring the sum of the elements in the list is less than or equal to `k`. The function outputs these lists, one for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not always generate a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues.

### Issues in the Code:

1. **Bitwise OR Maximization Logic**:
    - The code attempts to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR by using the binary representation of `k`. However, it does not ensure that the sum of the generated sequence equals `k`.
    - The code generates numbers based on the set bits of `k` but does not handle the case where the sum of these numbers is less than `k`.

2. **Handling the Sum Constraint**:
    - After generating numbers based on the set bits of `k`, the code appends the remaining sum to the sequence. However, this approach does not guarantee that the sequence will have exactly `n` elements.
    - If the number of set bits in `k` is less than `n`, the code appends zeros to make the sequence length `n`. This can result in a sequence that does not maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

### Example Case Where the Code Fails:

Let's consider the following test case:
```
1
3 6
```

#### Expected Output:
A sequence of 3 non-negative integers that sum up to 6 and maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR. One possible correct output could be:
```
2 2 2
```
Here, `2 | 2 | 2 = 2` in binary is `10`, which has 1 one.

Another correct output could be:
```
1 1 4
```
Here, `1 | 1 | 4 = 5` in binary is `101`, which has 2 ones.

#### Actual Output from the Code:
The code might generate:
```
2 0 4
```
Here, `2 | 0 | 4 = 6` in binary is `110`, which has 2 ones, but the sum is correct. However, the code might also generate:
```
2 2 0
```
Here, `2 | 2 | 0 = 2` in binary is `10`, which has only 1 one, and the sum is correct. But it does not maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

### Correct Approach:

To ensure the sequence sums up to `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR, we need to:
1. Use the set bits of `k` to generate numbers.
2. Ensure the sequence has exactly `n` elements.
3. Maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR while maintaining the sum constraint.

### Corrected Code Example:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        arr = []
        i = 0
        while k:
            if k & 1 == 1:
                arr.append(1 << i)
            k = k >> 1
            i += 1
        remaining = n - len(arr)
        if remaining > 0:
            if arr:
                arr[-1] += remaining * (1 << i)
            else:
                arr.append(remaining * (1 << i))
        while len(arr) < n:
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)

func()
```

This corrected code ensures that the sequence has exactly `n` elements and the sum of the sequence equals `k` while maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.
