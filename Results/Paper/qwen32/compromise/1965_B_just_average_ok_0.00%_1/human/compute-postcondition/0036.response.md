The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a conventional way to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. The loop runs for a number of times specified by `int(input())`, which is `n` in this context.

Given that the loop runs for `n` iterations, the state at the start of the next iteration does not need to change any of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, or `idx`, since these are not part of the loop head. The loop control is solely dependent on `n`, which indicates the total number of iterations.

Since the loop is about to start its next iteration, the state of `n` remains the same, and no other variables in the loop head need to be adjusted. The state of `idx` is not relevant to the loop control and remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be less than 8 but at least 4; `nums` is a list `[1, 2, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k - 2, k + 1, k + 3]`; `idx` is 1**
