To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the `nums` list based on the given `k` values.

The loop processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it:
1. Reads `n` and `k`.
2. Initializes `nums` with powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\).
3. Determines `idx` such that \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.
4. Modifies `nums` by removing \(2^{\text{idx}}\) and adding three new elements: `k - 2^{\text{idx}}`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1`.
5. Prints the length of the modified `nums` list and the elements of `nums`.

Given the output states for the first three iterations, we observe that `k` is in the range [4, 7] for these iterations. The specific changes to `nums` depend on the value of `k` and the corresponding `idx`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact values of `k` for all `t` iterations, we can generalize the final state based on the pattern observed:

- For each iteration, `nums` starts with the same initial set of powers of 2.
- `idx` is determined based on the value of `k`.
- `nums` is modified by removing one power of 2 and adding three new elements.

The final state after all iterations will be a combination of the initial set of powers of 2, minus the powers of 2 that were removed, plus all the new elements added across all iterations.

However, without the exact values of `k` for all `t` iterations, we can't specify the exact final `nums` list. But we can describe the output state in terms of the number of elements and the general form:

- The initial `nums` list has 24 elements.
- For each iteration, one element is removed and three are added.
- Therefore, for `t` iterations, the net change in the number of elements is `2t` (3 added - 1 removed per iteration).

Thus, the final length of `nums` will be `24 + 2t`.

The exact elements of `nums` will depend on the specific values of `k` used in each iteration, but the length and the general form (powers of 2 with some modifications) will be consistent.

Output State: **The length of `nums` is 24 + 2t, and `nums` contains the initial powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\) with modifications based on the values of `k` for each iteration.**
