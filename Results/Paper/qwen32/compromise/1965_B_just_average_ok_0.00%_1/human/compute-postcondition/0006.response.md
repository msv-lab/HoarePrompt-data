To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables involved in the loop condition: `k` and `idx`.

The loop condition is `k >= 1 << idx`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is greater than or equal to `2^idx` (since `1 << idx` is equivalent to `2^idx` in binary shift operations).

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (this variable is not involved in the loop condition, so it does not need to be adjusted).
- `n` is the first integer from the input (this variable is not involved in the loop condition, so it does not need to be adjusted).
- `k` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1 (this variable is involved in the loop condition).
- `nums` is a predefined list (this variable is not involved in the loop condition, so it does not need to be adjusted).
- `idx` is 1 (this variable is involved in the loop condition).

At the end of the previous iteration, `idx` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than or equal to `1 << 2` (which is 4). Therefore, `k` needs to be adjusted to be at least 4.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` must be greater than or equal to 4; `nums` is a list `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]`; `idx` is 1**
