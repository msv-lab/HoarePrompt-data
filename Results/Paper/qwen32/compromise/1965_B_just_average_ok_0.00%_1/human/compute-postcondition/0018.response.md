The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the range function which depends on the input `int(input())`. Since the loop body is omitted, we can infer that the loop will execute as many times as the integer input provided.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, the only thing that needs to be adjusted is the input to the `range` function to allow the loop to execute one more time.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be less than 8 but at least 4; `nums` is a list `[1, 2, 4, 8, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k - 4, k + 1, k + 5]`; `idx` is 2.

To execute the loop one more time, the input to the `range` function must be decremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be less than 8 but at least 4; `nums` is a list `[1, 2, 4, 8, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k - 4, k + 1, k + 5]`; `idx` is 2**. 

However, to reflect the state at the start of the next iteration where the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the input to the `range` function. Assuming `n` was the input to the `range` function, the new state should reflect `n` being decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input minus 1; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be less than 8 but at least 4; `nums` is a list `[1, 2, 4, 8, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k - 4, k + 1, k + 5]`; `idx` is 2**.
