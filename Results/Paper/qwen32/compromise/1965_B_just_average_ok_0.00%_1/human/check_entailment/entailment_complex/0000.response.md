### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a list `nums` with the first 24 powers of 2. This means `nums` initially contains `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^23]`.

2. **Modification Based on `k`**:
   - The program finds the highest power of 2 that is less than `k`. This is done by incrementing `idx` until `1 << idx` (which is \(2^{idx}\)) is no longer less than `k`. Then, it decrements `idx` by 1 to point to the highest power of 2 less than `k`.
   - It then removes the element `2^idx` from `nums`. This is because the presence of `2^idx` might allow for a subsequence that sums to `k`.
   - It adds three new elements to `nums`:
     - `k - nums[idx]`: This ensures that there is a way to form the sum `k` by adding this element to `nums[idx]`, but since `nums[idx]` is removed, this element alone will not form `k`.
     - `k + 1`: This ensures there is a way to form the sum `k + 1`.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This ensures there is a way to form the sum `k + nums[idx] + 1`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the length of the modified `nums` list and the elements of the list.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements:

- **No Subsequence Summing to `k`**:
  - The element `2^idx` is removed, which is the highest power of 2 less than `k`. This prevents the formation of `k` using the powers of 2 alone.
  - The added elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` do not directly contribute to forming `k` because `k - nums[idx]` alone cannot form `k` (since `nums[idx]` is removed), and `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` are greater than `k`.

- **Subsequences Summing to All `v` (1 ≤ v ≤ n, v ≠ k)**:
  - The initial powers of 2 allow for the formation of all sums from 1 to \(2^{24} - 1\) through various combinations of these numbers. Since `k` is removed from the possible sums by the removal of `2^idx` and the addition of elements that do not form `k`, the remaining elements can still form all sums from 1 to \(2^{24} - 1\) except `k`.
  - Given the constraints (with the sum of `n` across all test cases not exceeding \(10^7\)), the sequence of 24 powers of 2 is sufficient to cover all sums up to a very large number, ensuring that all sums from 1 to `n` (except `k`) can be formed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem's requirements for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
