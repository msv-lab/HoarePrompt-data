You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]
        idx = 0
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        idx -= 1
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)

        print(len(nums))
        
        print(*nums)
        
    #State: The length of `nums` is 24 + 2t, and `nums` contains the initial powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\) with modifications based on the values of `k` for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided program to see if it meets the requirements.

### Problem Recap:
We need to create a sequence `a` of non-negative integers such that:
1. There is no subsequence of `a` that sums to `k`.
2. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

### Program Analysis:
The program generates a sequence based on powers of 2, which is a well-known way to generate all possible sums up to a certain number (specifically, up to the sum of the first `m` powers of 2, which is `2^(m+1) - 1`). The program then adjusts this sequence to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Initialization**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. **For each test case**:
   - It reads `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes a list `nums` with the first 24 powers of 2 (`[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^23]`).
   - It finds the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` and removes it from the list.
   - It adds three additional numbers to the list:
     - `k - nums[idx]`: This ensures that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence.
     - `k + 1`: This ensures that `k + 1` can be formed.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This ensures that `k + nums[idx] + 1` can be formed.
3. **Output**: It prints the length of the adjusted list and the list itself.

### Correctness Check:
1. **Subsequences Summing to `v` for `1 ≤ v ≤ n` and `v ≠ k`**:
   - The initial list `nums` contains the first 24 powers of 2, which can form all sums from 1 to `2^24 - 1`.
   - By adding `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, we ensure that these sums can be formed.
   - The removal of `nums[idx]` and the addition of `k - nums[idx]` should not prevent the formation of any other sums up to `n` except `k`.

2. **No Subsequence Summing to `k`**:
   - The removal of `nums[idx]` and the addition of `k - nums[idx]` ensures that the exact sum `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to correctly adjust the sequence to meet the problem's requirements. It generates a sequence that can form all sums from 1 to `n` except `k`, and it ensures that no subsequence sums to `k`.

Thus, the program appears to be correct.

**Correctness: True**
