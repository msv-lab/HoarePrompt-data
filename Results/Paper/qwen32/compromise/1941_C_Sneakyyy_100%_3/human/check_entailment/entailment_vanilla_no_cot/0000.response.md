Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of characters to remove to make the string beautiful. The issue lies in the way it checks for the substrings "map" and "pie" and increments the index `i`. The current approach only considers every third character starting from the current index `i` if a match is found, which may not be optimal for minimizing deletions.

For example, consider the string "ppiee". The program will only check "ppi", "pie", and "ee" (the last two characters do not form a 3-character substring, so they are not checked). It will find "pie" and increment `i` by 3, resulting in an answer of 1, but the correct answer is 0 because no characters need to be removed.

A correct approach would involve dynamic programming or a more sophisticated greedy algorithm to ensure that the minimum number of deletions is calculated correctly.
