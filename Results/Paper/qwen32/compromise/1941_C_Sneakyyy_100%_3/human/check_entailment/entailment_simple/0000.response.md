### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is intended to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string to make it beautiful by ensuring it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map". The approach taken in the program is to iterate through the string in segments of 3 characters and count the occurrences of "pie" and "map", treating each occurrence as needing one removal to make the string beautiful. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

Consider the following issues with the program:

1. **Non-overlapping Segments**: The program only considers non-overlapping segments of 3 characters. For example, in the string "ppiepie", the program will only count one occurrence of "pie" and suggest one deletion, but it should suggest two deletions to remove both "pie" substrings.

2. **Greedy Approach**: The program uses a greedy approach where it removes one occurrence of "pie" or "map" at a time and moves the index forward by 3. This is not optimal because it might leave other "pie" or "map" substrings intact that could be removed with fewer deletions.

3. **Dynamic Programming or Other Approaches**: A more optimal solution would involve using dynamic programming or another approach to find the minimum number of deletions required, considering all possible substrings and their overlaps.

### Example:
Let's consider the input string "ppiepie". The program will count one "pie" and suggest one deletion. However, the optimal solution would be to remove the 'p's in the first and last positions, resulting in "iepie" and then removing the 'p' in the third position, resulting in "ieie", which requires two deletions.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly determine the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful because it does not handle overlapping substrings and does not use an optimal approach.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
