The value of `i` is incremented by 3. Given that `i` was either 1 or 3, after incrementing `i` by 3, `i` will be either 4 or 6. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `s`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string with length greater than 5, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, `i` is either 4 or 6, `ans` is either 0 or 1.**
