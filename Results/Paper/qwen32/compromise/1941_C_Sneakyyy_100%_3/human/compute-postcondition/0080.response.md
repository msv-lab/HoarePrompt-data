Let's break down the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
2. `n` is an input integer.
3. `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `len(a) - 2` such that the loop condition `i < len(a) - 2` fails. This implies that `i` is at least `len(a) - 2` and possibly more, but the exact value of `i` is not crucial for the final output since it is not used in the `print` statement.
4. `ans` is the total number of times the substrings 'map' or 'pie' appear in non-overlapping segments of length 3 within the string `a`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Explanation:
The variable `ans` is calculated based on the string `a` by counting the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie'. The exact value of `ans` depends on the content of the string `a`, which is not provided in the initial state. However, we know that `ans` is the count of these specific substrings.

### Output:
Since the exact content of the string `a` is not provided, we can't determine the numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the given information.

Output: **ans (where ans is the total number of times 'map' or 'pie' appears in non-overlapping segments of length 3 within the string `a`)**
