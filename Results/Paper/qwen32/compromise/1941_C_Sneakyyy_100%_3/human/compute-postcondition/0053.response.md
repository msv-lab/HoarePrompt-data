To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, we need to understand the variables and their values based on the initial state provided:

1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. This variable does not directly affect the `ans` variable or the output of the `print(ans)` statement.

2. **`n`**: The integer value from user input. This variable also does not directly affect the `ans` variable or the output of the `print(ans)` statement.

3. **`a`**: The string entered by the user. This is the string in which we will look for the substrings 'map' or 'pie'.

4. **`i`**: This variable is set to `i_final`, which is determined based on the length of `a` and the presence of 'map' or 'pie' at the end of `a`. Specifically:
   - If the last chunk of `a` (the last 3 characters) is 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is the largest multiple of 3 that is less than `len(a)`.
   - Otherwise, `i` is `len(a) - 2`.

5. **`ans`**: This variable is set to `ans_final`, which is the total number of times 'map' or 'pie' appears in non-overlapping chunks of 3 characters in the string `a`.

Given this information, the `print(ans)` statement will output the total count of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the total number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`)**
