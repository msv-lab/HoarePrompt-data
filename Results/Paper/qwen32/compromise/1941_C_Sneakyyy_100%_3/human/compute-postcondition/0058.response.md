The value of `i` is set to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `i_final`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the string entered by the user, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0.
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the string entered by the user, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0.**
