The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`, which means `n` is being reassigned to the integer value of the user's input. All other variables (`t`, `a`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged as per the initial state provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the integer value from user input, `a` is a string entered by the user, `i` is the largest index such that i < len(a) - 2 after the loop terminates, `ans` is the number of times the substring 'map' or 'pie' was found in `a`**.
