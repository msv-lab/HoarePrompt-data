The value of `i` is incremented by 3. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string with a length of at least 6 if `i` was 3, otherwise at least 3, `i` is now `i + 3` and must still be less than `len(a) - 2`, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string with a length of at least 6 if `i` was 3, otherwise at least 3, `i` is `i + 3` and must be less than `len(a) - 2`, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`.**
