The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `s`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string with a length of at least 6 if `i` was 3, otherwise at least 3, `i` must be less than len(a) - 2, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, and `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string with a length of at least 6 if `i` was 3, otherwise at least 3, `i` must be less than len(a) - 2, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, `i` is increased by 1.**
