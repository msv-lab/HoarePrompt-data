In this task, we need to ensure the loop can execute based on the information provided in the loop head. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable that can be adjusted here is the value returned by `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Given that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `t` represents the number of test cases, we need to ensure that `int(input())` reflects the number of test cases `t`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `int(input())` returns a value greater than 0, specifically `t` (the number of test cases).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `int(input())` returns `t`**
