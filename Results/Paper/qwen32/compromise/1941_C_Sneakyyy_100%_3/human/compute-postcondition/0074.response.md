The code snippet `s = a[i:i + 3]` slices the string `a` starting from index `i` (which is 2) and takes the next 3 characters. Therefore, `s` will be the substring of `a` from index 2 to 5 (non-inclusive).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string with length greater than 5, `i` is 2, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `s` is the substring of `a` from index 2 to 5**.
