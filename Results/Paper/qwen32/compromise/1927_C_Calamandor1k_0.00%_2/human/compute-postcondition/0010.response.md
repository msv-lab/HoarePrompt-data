Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input that must have at least 1 element or `b` is a list of integers read from input that must have at least 1 element; `len_a` is the length of list `a`; `len_b` is the length of list `b`; `count_a` is 0; `count_b` is 0; `d` is `k // 2`. The length of list `a` (`len_a`) is greater than `i + 1`. The current element `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`.**
