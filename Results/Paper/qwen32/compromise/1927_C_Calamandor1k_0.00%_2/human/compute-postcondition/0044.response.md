Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1` such that `t` >= 0; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from input; `a` is a new list of integers read from input; `b` is a new list of integers read from input; `len_a` must be at least 1 or `len_b` must be at least 1; `d` is `k // 2`; `count_a` is 0; `count_b` is 0; `len_a` is greater than `i + 1`; the current value of `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`.**
