The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. The loop will run `t` times, so for the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1. The other variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1**
