The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a new list `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` are not modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `b` is a list of integers read from input.**
