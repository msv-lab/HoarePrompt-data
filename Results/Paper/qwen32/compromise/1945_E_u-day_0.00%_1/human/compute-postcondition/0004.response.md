To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to analyze the loop and how it modifies the variables.

The loop iterates `n` times, and during each iteration, it checks if the element at the current index `i` in the array `arr` is equal to `k`. If it is, it updates the variable `pos` to the current index `i`.

The initial state of `pos` is -1, indicating that `k` has not been found yet. After the loop completes, `pos` will either remain -1 (if `k` is not found in `arr`) or it will be the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`.

The variables `n`, `k`, `arr`, `low`, `high`, and `st` are not modified by the loop body and thus remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state will be:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `low` is 0, `high` is n-1, `st` is a set used to store midpoints visited during the binary search.**
