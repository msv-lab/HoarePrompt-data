To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition `low + 1 < high`. The variables `low` and `high` are the only ones that can be adjusted according to the loop head.

Given:
- `low` is initialized to 0.
- `high` is initialized to `n-1`.

For the loop to execute, the condition `low + 1 < high` must be true. This translates to:
\[ 0 + 1 < high \]
\[ 1 < high \]
\[ high > 1 \]

Since `high` is set to `n-1`, for `high` to be greater than 1, it must be that:
\[ n - 1 > 1 \]
\[ n > 2 \]

Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2 to ensure that `high` (which is `n-1`) is greater than 1, allowing the loop to execute.

No other variables in the loop condition (`low` and `high`) need to be adjusted further as long as `n` is greater than 2.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `k` and `arr` are the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `low` is 0, `high` is `n-1`, `st` is an empty set**.
