Reasoning:
The provided Python program is intended to solve the problem by iterating over multiple test cases, where each test case involves calculating the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n`. However, there are several issues with the given program that make it incorrect:

1. **Global Sum Accumulation**: The variable `soma` is used globally to accumulate the sum of digits across all test cases. This is incorrect because the sum of digits for each test case should be computed independently and then printed separately for each test case.

2. **Incorrect Range in Loop**: The loop `for i in range(n):` should be `for i in range(1, n+1):` to include the number `n` itself in the sum of digits calculation.

3. **Function Definition Placement**: The function `func_1` is defined after it is used in the code, which is not a syntax error in Python but is generally bad practice. It should be defined before it is called.

4. **Missing Output for Each Test Case**: The program should output the sum of digits for each test case separately, but it currently accumulates all sums in a single variable and does not print anything until the end of the program.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
