The given code appends the result of `k - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `l1` is a new list of strings obtained from the input
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`
- `arr` is an empty list
- `i` is the maximum value for which `temp * 2 < k` holds true
- `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`
- `k0` is equal to `k`
- The input that controls the loop has decremented by 1
- `ans` is a list containing the single element `(1 << i) - 1`

After executing `ans.append(k - sum(ans))`, the value of `ans` changes. Initially, `ans` contains one element `(1 << i) - 1`. The new element being appended is `k - sum(ans)`, which simplifies to `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`.

Therefore, the updated `ans` list will contain two elements: `[(1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1)]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a new list of strings obtained from the input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `i` is the maximum value for which `temp * 2 < k` holds true; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`; `k0` is equal to `k`; The input that controls the loop has decremented by 1; `ans` is a list containing the elements `[(1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1)]`.**
