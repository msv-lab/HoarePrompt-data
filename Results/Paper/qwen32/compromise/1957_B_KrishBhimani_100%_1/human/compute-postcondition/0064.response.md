To determine the output of the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the `ans` list step-by-step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input.
   - `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
   - `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.
   - `arr` is an empty list.
   - `ans` is a list containing `n` elements, where the first two elements are `[(1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1)]` and the remaining `n-2` elements are `0`.
   - `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became greater than or equal to `k`.
   - `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.
   - `k0` is equal to `k`.

2. **Determine `temp` and `i`**:
   - `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`. This means `temp = 2^i` where `i` is the highest integer such that `2^i < k`.
   - `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became greater than or equal to `k`.

3. **Constructing `ans`**:
   - The first element of `ans` is `(1 << i) - 1`, which is `2^i - 1` (the same as `temp`).
   - The second element of `ans` is `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`, which is `k - temp`.
   - The remaining `n-2` elements of `ans` are `0`.

4. **Output**:
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print all elements of the `ans` list separated by spaces.

Given this breakdown, the output can be described as follows:

- The first element of `ans` is `2^i - 1`, where `i` is the highest integer such that `2^i < k`.
- The second element of `ans` is `k - (2^i - 1)`.
- The remaining `n-2` elements of `ans` are `0`.

Thus, the output will be:

Output: **2^i - 1, k - (2^i - 1), 0, 0, ..., 0 (where i is the highest integer such that 2^i < k, and there are n-2 zeros)**
