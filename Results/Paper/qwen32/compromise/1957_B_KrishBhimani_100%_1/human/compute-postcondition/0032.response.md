Let's break down the given initial state and understand the variables and their relationships:

1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable does not directly influence the `print(*ans)` statement, so it can be ignored for this specific print operation.
2. **`l1`**: A list of strings. The first element of `l1` is converted to an integer `n`, and the second element is converted to an integer `k`.
3. **`n`**: The integer value of the first element of `l1`.
4. **`k`**: The integer value of the second element of `l1`.
5. **`arr`**: An empty list. This variable is not used in the `print(*ans)` statement.
6. **`k0`**: Initially set to `k`. This variable is not used in the `print(*ans)` statement.
7. **`ans`**: A list constructed with the following elements:
   - `(1 << i) - 1`: This is \(2^i - 1\).
   - `k - (1 << i) + 1`: This is \(k - 2^i + 1\).
   - `n - len(ans)` zeros: This is the number of zeros needed to make the length of `ans` equal to `n`.

8. **`i`**: The number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became greater than or equal to `k`.
9. **`temp`**: The largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.

### Steps to Determine the Output:

1. **Determine `temp` and `i`**:
   - `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`. For example, if `k = 10`, then `temp = 8` because \(2^3 = 8\) and \(2^4 = 16\) which is greater than 10.
   - `i` is the exponent such that \(2^i = temp\). In the example above, `i = 3`.

2. **Construct `ans`**:
   - The first element of `ans` is `(1 << i) - 1`, which is \(2^i - 1\). Using the example where `i = 3`, this becomes \(2^3 - 1 = 7\).
   - The second element of `ans` is `k - (1 << i) + 1`, which is \(k - 2^i + 1\). Using the example where `k = 10` and `i = 3`, this becomes \(10 - 8 + 1 = 3\).
   - The remaining elements of `ans` are zeros, and the number of zeros is `n - len(ans)`. Since `len(ans)` is initially 2 (after adding the first two elements), the number of zeros is `n - 2`.

### Final Output Description:

Given the above steps, the `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list separated by spaces. The first two elements are \(2^i - 1\) and \(k - 2^i + 1\), and the rest are zeros until the length of `ans` reaches `n`.

Thus, the output can be described as:
Output: **\(2^i - 1\), \(k - 2^i + 1\), followed by \(n - 2\) zeros (where \(i\) is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\))**
