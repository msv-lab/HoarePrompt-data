To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state step-by-step:

1. **Variable Initialization:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input.
   - `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
   - `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.

2. **Conditional Execution:**
   - If `n` equals 1, the program does not alter `t`, `l1`, `n`, or `k`.
   - Otherwise (`n` is not 1):
     - `arr` is initialized as an empty list.
     - `ans` is a list containing `n` elements, where the first two elements are `[(1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1)]` and the remaining `n-2` elements are `0`.
     - `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became greater than or equal to `k`.
     - `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.
     - `k0` is set to `k`.

3. **Loop and Decrement:**
   - The input that controls the loop has decremented by 1.

Given these conditions, the value of `k` remains unchanged unless `n` is not equal to 1, and even then, `k` is only used in calculations but not reassigned a new value outside of those calculations.

Since the problem does not specify any further changes to `k` after its initial assignment from `l1`, and there is no indication that `k` is modified elsewhere in the provided code snippet, we can conclude that the value of `k` remains the same as it was initially assigned from the second element of `l1`.

Therefore, the `print(k)` statement will output the value of `k` as it was initially assigned.

Output: **k (where k is the integer value of the second element of the list l1)**
