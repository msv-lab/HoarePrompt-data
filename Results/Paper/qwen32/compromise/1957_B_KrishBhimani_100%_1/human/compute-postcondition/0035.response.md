The given code snippet updates the value of `l1` by reading a line of input and splitting it into a list of strings. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, `ans`, `i`, or `temp` as they are not modified in the provided code.

Given that `l1` is initially a list of strings and the first two elements of `l1` define `n` and `k`, after the input operation, `l1` will contain the new input values split by spaces.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`. If `n` equals 1, the program does not alter `t`, `l1`, `n`, or `k`. Otherwise, `arr` remains an empty list; `k0` remains equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing the elements \((1 << i) - 1\), `k - (1 << i) + 1`, and `n - len(ans)` zeros; `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became greater than or equal to `k`; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.**
