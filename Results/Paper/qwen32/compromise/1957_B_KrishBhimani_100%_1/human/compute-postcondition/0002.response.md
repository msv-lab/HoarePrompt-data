The code snippet assigns the first element of the list `l1` to `n` and the second element to `k` after converting them to integers. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `l1` is a list of strings. After executing the code, `n` and `k` will hold the integer values of the first and second elements of `l1`, respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.**
