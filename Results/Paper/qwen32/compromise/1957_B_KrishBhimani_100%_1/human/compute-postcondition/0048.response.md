Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `temp` is 1; `k0` is equal to `k`; and `temp * 2` is greater than or equal to `k`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables remain unchanged, and we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
