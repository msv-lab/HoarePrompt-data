The code snippet provided only contains the line `i = 0`, which sets the variable `i` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `ans`, `k0`, `temp`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; if `n` equals 1, the program does not alter `t`, `l1`, `n`, or `k`; otherwise, `k0` remains equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing the elements \((1 << i) - 1\), `k - (1 << i) + 1`, and `n - len(ans)` zeros; `i` is 0; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`; `k0` is equal to `k`.**

In natural language: The variable `i` is set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
