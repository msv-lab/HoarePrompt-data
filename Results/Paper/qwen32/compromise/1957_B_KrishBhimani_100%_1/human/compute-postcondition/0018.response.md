In this case, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely unless there is a `break` statement inside the loop body (which is omitted here). Since there is no condition in the loop head to evaluate, no adjustments to the program state are necessary to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

Therefore, the state remains the same as at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `temp * 2` is less than `k`; `temp` is either `2 * temp` if `temp * 2` is less than `k`, otherwise `temp` remains 1.**
