Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `temp * 2` is less than `k`; `temp` is either `4 * temp` if initially `temp * 2` was less than `k`, otherwise `temp` remains 1; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
