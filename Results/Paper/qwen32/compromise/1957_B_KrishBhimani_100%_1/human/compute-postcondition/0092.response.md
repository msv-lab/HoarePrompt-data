To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables `temp` and `i` evolve based on the condition `if temp * 2 < k`.

### Loop Analysis
The loop continues as long as `temp * 2 < k`. Each iteration doubles `temp` and increments `i` by 1. This process continues until `temp * 2` is no longer less than `k`.

### Final Output State
Let's denote the maximum value of `i` for which `temp * 2 < k` holds true as `i_max`. At the end of the loop, `temp` will be `2^(i_max + 1)` and `i` will be `i_max`. The loop terminates when `temp * 2 >= k`, meaning `temp` will be the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.

### Calculation
1. **Initialization**: `temp = 1`, `i = 0`
2. **Loop Condition**: `temp * 2 < k`
3. **Termination**: `temp * 2 >= k`

After the loop terminates:
- `temp` will be the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.
- `i` will be the exponent of that power of 2.

### Output State
The final output state will be:
- `t`: remains unchanged (integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\))
- `l1`: remains unchanged (list of strings obtained from the input)
- `n`: remains unchanged (integer value of the first element of the new `l1`)
- `k`: remains unchanged (integer value of the second element of the new `l1`)
- `arr`: remains unchanged (empty list)
- `i`: the maximum value for which `temp * 2 < k` holds true
- `temp`: the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`
- `k0`: remains unchanged (equal to `k`)
- The input that controls the loop has decremented by 1
- `ans`: remains unchanged (empty list)

### Conclusion
The final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a new list of strings obtained from the input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `i` is the maximum value for which `temp * 2 < k` holds true; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`; `k0` is equal to `k`; The input that controls the loop has decremented by 1; `ans` is an empty list.**
