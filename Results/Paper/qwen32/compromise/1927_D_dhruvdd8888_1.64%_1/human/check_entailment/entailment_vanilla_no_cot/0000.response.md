Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly handle all the cases as described in the problem statement. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The code does not correctly handle all edge cases, especially when the segment defined by the query (l, r) contains only one unique element.

2. **Logic for Finding Pairs**: The logic for finding the pair of indices (i, j) such that `a_i != a_j` is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly identify such pairs for all possible queries.

3. **Bisect Usage**: The use of `bisect_left` and the subsequent logic to determine the indices does not correctly identify the required pair of indices in all scenarios.

4. **Test Case Handling**: The code includes some test case-specific print statements (`if ppp == 23:`) that are unnecessary and may affect the output.

5. **Query Processing**: The code skips processing queries for test cases where `tc > 5` and `ppp == 23`, which is not the intended behavior.

To correctly solve the problem, the code should iterate through the array segment defined by each query and find the first pair of different elements. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
from sys import stdin

def process_test_case():
    n = int(stdin.readline())
    a = list(map(int, stdin.readline().split()))
    q = int(stdin.readline())
    results = []
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        l -= 1  # Convert to 0-based index
        r -= 1  # Convert to 0-based index
        found = False
        for i in range(l, r):
            if a[i] != a[i + 1]:
                results.append(f"{i + 1} {i + 2}")
                found = True
                break
        if not found:
            results.append("-1 -1")
    return "\n".join(results)

def main():
    t = int(stdin.readline())
    outputs = []
    for _ in range(t):
        outputs.append(process_test_case())
    print("\n".join(outputs))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected code processes each query by checking the elements within the specified range and finds the first pair of different elements, or reports that no such pair exists.
