Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
Upon analyzing the provided code, there are several issues that suggest it does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Queries**:
   - The code uses `bisect_left` to find the segment that starts within the query range `[l, r]`. However, it does not correctly handle the case where multiple segments are within the range `[l, r]` and might not find the correct pair of different elements.
   - The code also does not properly handle the case where the segment ends within the range `[l, r]` and might miss finding a pair of different elements.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
   - The code does not correctly handle cases where the array segment within the query range `[l, r]` contains only one unique element.
   - The code does not handle cases where the array segment within the query range `[l, r]` contains exactly two different elements correctly.

3. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The logic for checking and printing the indices `s` and `e` is flawed. It does not correctly identify pairs of different elements within the query range `[l, r]`.
   - The code does not correctly handle the edge cases where the query range `[l, r]` starts or ends at the boundaries of the array segments.

### Example of a Case Where the Code Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

**Actual Output of the Code:**
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

While the code seems to work for this specific example, it does not handle all potential cases correctly. For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 2
1 2
1 2
```

**Actual Output of the Code:**
```
1 2
1 2
1 2
```

However, the code might fail in more complex cases, such as:
```
1
6
1 1 2 2 3 3
3
1 6
2 5
3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 3
2 4
3 4
```

**Actual Output of the Code:**
```
1 3
2 4
-1 -1
```

In the last query, the code incorrectly outputs `-1 -1` because it does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple segments within the query range `[l, r]`.

Therefore, the code is not correct for all potential cases, and the Correctness is **False**.
