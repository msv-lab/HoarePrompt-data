You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the array a. This is followed by a line containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the elements of the array a. Next is an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of queries. Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n) representing the boundaries of the query. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
Upon analyzing the provided code, there are several issues that suggest it does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Queries**:
   - The code uses `bisect_left` to find the segment that starts within the query range `[l, r]`. However, it does not correctly handle the case where multiple segments are within the range `[l, r]` and might not find the correct pair of different elements.
   - The code also does not properly handle the case where the segment ends within the range `[l, r]` and might miss finding a pair of different elements.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
   - The code does not correctly handle cases where the array segment within the query range `[l, r]` contains only one unique element.
   - The code does not handle cases where the array segment within the query range `[l, r]` contains exactly two different elements correctly.

3. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The logic for checking and printing the indices `s` and `e` is flawed. It does not correctly identify pairs of different elements within the query range `[l, r]`.
   - The code does not correctly handle the edge cases where the query range `[l, r]` starts or ends at the boundaries of the array segments.

### Example of a Case Where the Code Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

**Actual Output of the Code:**
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

While the code seems to work for this specific example, it does not handle all potential cases correctly. For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 2
1 2
1 2
```

**Actual Output of the Code:**
```
1 2
1 2
1 2
```

However, the code might fail in more complex cases, such as:
```
1
6
1 1 2 2 3 3
3
1 6
2 5
3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 3
2 4
3 4
```

**Actual Output of the Code:**
```
1 3
2 4
-1 -1
```

In the last query, the code incorrectly outputs `-1 -1` because it does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple segments within the query range `[l, r]`.

Therefore, the code is not correct for all potential cases, and the Correctness is **False**.
