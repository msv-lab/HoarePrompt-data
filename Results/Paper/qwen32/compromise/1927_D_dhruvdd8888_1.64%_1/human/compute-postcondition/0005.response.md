The code assigns the first element of the list `nums` to the variable `num`. The values of `N`, `nums`, `s`, and `e` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is assigned the value of the first integer read from the input, `nums` is a list of integers representing the elements of the array `a`, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, and `num` is the first element of `nums`.

Output State: **`N` is assigned the value of the first integer read from the input, `nums` is a list of integers representing the elements of the array `a`, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is `nums[0]`.**
