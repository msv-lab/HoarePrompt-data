The code reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers, which are assigned to the variable `nums`. The variable `N` is already assigned the value of the first integer read from the input, which represents the length of the array `a`. The elements of the array `a` are now stored in `nums`.

Output State: **`N` is assigned the value of the first integer read from the input, `nums` is a list of integers representing the elements of the array `a`.**
