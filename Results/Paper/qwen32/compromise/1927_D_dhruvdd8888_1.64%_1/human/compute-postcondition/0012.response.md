To determine what will be printed, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

1. `N` is the first integer read from the input.
2. `nums` is a list of integers representing the elements of the array `a` with an additional `-1` at the end.
3. `s` is the last index where a new segment started.
4. `e` is 0.
5. `num` is `-1`.
6. `arr` is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`.
7. `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
8. `ppp` equals 23.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(nums)
```

From the initial state, the only variable that is directly printed is `nums`. According to the description, `nums` is a list of integers representing the elements of the array `a` with an additional `-1` at the end. The specific values of the integers in `nums` are not provided, except for the last element which is `-1`.

Since the exact values of the integers in `nums` (except for the last element) are not specified, we can only describe the structure of the list. The list `nums` will contain the elements of the array `a` followed by `-1`.

Thus, the output will be a list of integers that includes all elements of `a` followed by `-1`.

Output: **[elements of array a, -1] (where elements of array a are the integers that form the array a)**
