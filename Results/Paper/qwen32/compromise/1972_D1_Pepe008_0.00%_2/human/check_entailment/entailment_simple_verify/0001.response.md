### Reasoning

To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze the problem statement and the logic implemented in the code, especially considering the annotations.

#### Problem Recap
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

This means there exists an integer \(k\) such that:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]

#### Code Analysis
The provided code attempts to solve this problem using a different approach:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (n, m) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            x = (n - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if n - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        print(suma - 1)
```

#### Annotations
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- The program reads the number of test cases \(T\).
- For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
- It initializes `suma` to 0.
- It iterates over possible values of `b` from 1 to `m`.
- For each `b`, it calculates `x` as `(n - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
- It adds `x` to `suma` if `n - i * (i - 1) > 0`.
- Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

#### Evaluation
The provided code does not directly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it uses a formula derived from some mathematical insight, which is not immediately clear from the problem statement or the annotations.

To verify the correctness, let's consider the logic:
- The code calculates `x` based on a specific formula involving `n` and `i`.
- It sums up these values under certain conditions and subtracts 1 from the final sum.

However, the formula used in the code does not seem to be derived from the condition \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The annotations do not provide enough information to confirm that the formula correctly counts the valid pairs.

Given the problem constraints and the need for an efficient solution, the provided code might be based on some advanced mathematical insight, but without a clear derivation or validation against the problem statement, we cannot confidently say it is correct.

#### Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the lack of clear derivation or validation of the formula used in the code, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
