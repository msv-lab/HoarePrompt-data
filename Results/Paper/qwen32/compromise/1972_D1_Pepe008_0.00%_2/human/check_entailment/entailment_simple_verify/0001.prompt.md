You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided code to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

We need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

This means there exists an integer \(k\) such that:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]

### Code Analysis

The provided code does not directly implement the above logic. Instead, it seems to be trying to count pairs using some mathematical manipulation, but it's not immediately clear what it's doing. Let's break down the code:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (n, m) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            x = (n - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if n - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        print(suma - 1)
```

#### Key Points:
1. The outer loop iterates over possible values of `b` from 1 to `m`.
2. For each `b`, it calculates `x` as `(n - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
3. It adds `x` to `suma` if `n - i * (i - 1) > 0`.
4. Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

### Checking the Logic

The logic in the code does not align with the problem statement. The code seems to be counting something related to the values of `a` and `b`, but it doesn't correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correct Approach

A more straightforward approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs (a, b) and checking the condition directly. However, this would be inefficient given the constraints. A more optimized approach might involve mathematical insights or properties of the gcd function, but the provided code does not seem to follow such an approach correctly.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
