### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided code systematically using the function summary and the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

This means there exists an integer \(k\) such that:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The code provided is:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (n, m) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            x = (n - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if n - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        print(suma - 1)
```

#### Function Summary Recap:
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it computes a specific sum based on these integers and outputs the result minus one.

#### Detailed Evaluation:
1. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop iterates over possible values of `b` from 1 to `m`.
2. **Inner Calculation**: For each `b`, it calculates `x` as `(n - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
3. **Condition Check**: It adds `x` to `suma` if `n - i * (i - 1) > 0`.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

#### Verification Against Problem Requirements:
The provided code does not directly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it uses a mathematical formula that does not correspond to the problem's requirements. The function summary does not clarify how this formula relates to the problem, and the code does not seem to implement the necessary logic to solve the problem correctly.

#### Testing with Examples:
Let's manually verify the code with the provided example inputs:
- For the first test case with \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1\):
  - Only pair \((1, 1)\) should be counted.
  - The code calculates `suma` as 1 and outputs 0, which is incorrect.
  
- For the second test case with \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):
  - Valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\).
  - The code calculates `suma` as 3 and outputs 2, which is incorrect.

Given these discrepancies, the code does not correctly solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
Based on the detailed analysis and testing, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
