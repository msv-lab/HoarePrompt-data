Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, `suma` is updated to `suma + x`.**
