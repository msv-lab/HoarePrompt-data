The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t` and the constant `T`. If `t` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` was incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be less than `T`.

State: **`suma` is the accumulated sum of all `x` values where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` for `i` from 1 to `b`. `t` is incremented by 1, `info` remains the list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, and `b` remains the same.**

Since `t` was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, the new value of `t` should be the old value of `t` plus 1. We don't need to adjust any other variables as per the loop head.

State: **`suma` is the accumulated sum of all `x` values where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` for `i` from 1 to `b`. `t` is now `t + 1`, `info` remains the list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, and `b` remains the same.**

To make it clear that `t` is incremented:

State: **`suma` is the accumulated sum of all `x` values where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` for `i` from 1 to `b`. `t` is incremented by 1, `info` remains the list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, and `b` remains the same.**

Given that `t` was just incremented, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`suma` is the accumulated sum of all `x` values where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` for `i` from 1 to `b`. `t` is `t + 1`, `info` remains the list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, and `b` remains the same.**
