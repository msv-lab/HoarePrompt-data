Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: `i` is `i + 1`

Code Snippet:
```python
x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
```

The value of `i` is already defined as `i + 1`. We need to compute the value of `x` using the given formula. Since `i` is `i + 1`, we substitute this into the equation:

```python
x = (a - (i + 1) * ((i + 1) - 1)) // (i + 1) ** 2 + 1
x = (a - (i + 1) * i) // (i + 1) ** 2 + 1
```

This is the expression for `x` in terms of `a` and `i`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `x` is `(a - (i + 1) * i) // (i + 1) ** 2 + 1`**

Natural Language Explanation:
The value of `i` remains `i + 1` as per the initial state. The variable `x` is calculated using the formula `(a - (i + 1) * i) // (i + 1) ** 2 + 1`, where `a` and `i` are used in the expression.
