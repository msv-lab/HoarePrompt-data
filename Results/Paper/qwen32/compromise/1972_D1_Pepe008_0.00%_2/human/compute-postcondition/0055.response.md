To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`.

Given:
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is defined by the conditions:
  - `i` is incremented (`i = i + 1`) if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`; otherwise, `i` remains unchanged.
  - `x` is calculated as `(a - (i + 1) * (i + 1)) // (i + 1)` if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`; otherwise, `x` is `(a - i * i) // i`.
  - `suma` is updated to `suma + x` if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.

However, the loop head only involves `i` and `b`. Therefore, we need to adjust only these two variables.

Let's break down the logic:
- If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, then `i` is incremented to `i + 1`.
- The variable `b` does not change during the loop iterations; it is a constant that defines the upper limit of the loop.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, `i` should be `i + 1`.
- If `a - i * (i - 1) <= 0`, `i` remains `i`.
- `b` remains unchanged.

Since the problem specifies that we only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we don't need to consider `x` or `suma`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `i + 1` if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, otherwise `i` remains unchanged, `b` remains the same**.
