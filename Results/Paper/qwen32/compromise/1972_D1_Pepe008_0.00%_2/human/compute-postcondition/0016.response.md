The value of `x` is calculated using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. The values of `T`, `info`, `a`, `b`, and the incremented `i` remain unchanged except for `x` which is newly calculated.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.**
