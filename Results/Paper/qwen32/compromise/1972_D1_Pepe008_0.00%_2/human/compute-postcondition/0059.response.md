To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables based on the given conditions.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = b` (inclusive).
2. For each iteration, it calculates `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
3. It checks if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`. If true, it adds `x` to `suma`.
4. The variable `t` is incremented by 1 outside the loop, but since it is not part of the loop's body, it remains unchanged during the loop iterations.
5. The variables `info`, `a`, and `b` are set before the loop starts and do not change within the loop.

Let's summarize the final state of `suma` after the loop completes all iterations:

- `suma` accumulates the value of `x` for each iteration where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.
- `t` remains `t + 1` as per the initial state description.
- `info`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

### Calculation of `suma`

To compute the final value of `suma`, we need to sum up all valid `x` values from each iteration where the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` holds true.

Let's denote the final value of `suma` as `S`.

**Output State: **`suma` is `S`, `t` is `t + 1`, `info` is the new list of strings obtained from the latest input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, and `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`.**

In natural language, the final output state means that `suma` will hold the accumulated sum of `x` values calculated in each iteration where the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` is satisfied. The variable `t` will be incremented by 1, and `info`, `a`, and `b` will retain their initial values as they are not modified within the loop.
