Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4; `info` is a list of strings; `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`; `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`; `suma` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, b + 1):
    x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
    if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
        suma += x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `suma` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i` if `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, and `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. If `a - i * (i - 1)` is not greater than 0, the value of `suma` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is incremented by 1. If `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, `suma` is recalculated as the old value of `suma` plus `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i` and `x` is set to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. Otherwise, `suma` remains unchanged and `x` is not recalculated.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, `suma` is updated to `suma + x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
