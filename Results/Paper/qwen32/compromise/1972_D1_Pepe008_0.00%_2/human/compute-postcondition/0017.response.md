Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `suma` is updated to `suma + x`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `x` is recalculated using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. The value of `suma` is updated by adding the new value of `x` to it. All other variables retain their previous values.
