To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`.

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `b` inclusive.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has taken some value, and `t` and `suma` have been updated based on the condition and calculation provided.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- `b` remains unchanged as it defines the upper limit of the loop.

### Given State:
- `suma` is `x` if `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, otherwise `suma` remains 0.
- `t` is `t + 1`.
- `info` is the new list of strings obtained from the latest input.
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`.
- `b` must be at least 0.
- `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.

### Calculation for Next Iteration:
- Let's denote the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`.
- At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.
- `b` remains the same.

### Final State:
- `suma` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i` (`i_prev + 1`).
- `t` will be incremented again.
- `info`, `a`, and `b` remain the same.

### State Representation:
Since we don't know the exact values of `suma`, `t`, `info`, `a`, and `b` except for the relationship between them, we represent the state as follows:

State: **`suma` is `x` if `a - (i + 1) * i` is greater than 0, otherwise `suma` remains 0, `t` is `t + 1`, `info` is the new list of strings obtained from the latest input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 0, `x` is `(a - (i + 1) * i) // (i + 1)`, `i` is `i + 1`**

However, since `i` is the only variable that changes in the loop head, we can simplify it to:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`** (with the understanding that other variables will be recalculated based on this new `i`).
