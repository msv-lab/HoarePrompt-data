Output State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()`, and they are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `i` is 1.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are the values returned by `func_7()`. The variable `i` is set to 1. All other conditions and constraints on `n` and `m` are still valid.
