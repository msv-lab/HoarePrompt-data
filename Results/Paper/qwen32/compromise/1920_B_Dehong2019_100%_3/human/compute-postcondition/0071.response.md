Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input and greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the new input, `k` is the second integer read from the new input, `x` must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `i + 1`, `ans1` is `sum(a) - a[i] * 6`, `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` encountered during the iterations**.

In natural language: The value of `ans1` is updated to be `sum(a) - a[i] * 6`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
