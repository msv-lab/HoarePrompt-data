Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n`, `k`, `x`, and the list `a`.**
