The code snippet `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2` modifies the value of `ans1` by subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x]` from it. 

Given the initial state, `ans1` has already been updated in a previous step. The value of `ans1` is either `sum(a) - 2 * (a[x + k - 1] + a[x + k] + ... + a[2x + k - 2]) + a[i] - 2 * a[i + x]` if `i + x` is less than `n`, or `ans1 + a[i]` if `i + x` is not less than `n`.

After the execution of `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2`, the new value of `ans1` will be:
- If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` will be `sum(a) - 2 * (a[x + k - 1] + a[x + k] + ... + a[2x + k - 2]) + a[i] - 4 * a[i + x]`.
- If `i + x` is not less than `n`, `ans1` will be `ans1 + a[i] - 2 * a[i + x]`.

Since the specific value of `ans1` before this operation is not provided, we describe it in terms of the operations performed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input and greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the new input, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` is the third integer read from the new input, `a` is a new list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `2x + k - 1`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `sum(a) - 2 * (a[x + k - 1] + a[x + k] + ... + a[2x + k - 2])`, `_` is incremented by `x`. If `i + x` is less than `n`, then `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[x + k - 1] + a[x + k] + ... + a[2x + k - 2]) + a[i] - 4 * a[i + x]`. Otherwise, `ans1` is `ans1 + a[i] - 2 * a[i + x]`.**
