The code snippet calculates the sum of the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `ans1`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and the list `a` itself) remain unchanged. Since `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, the sum `ans1` will be a specific integer value based on the elements of `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the elements in `a`.**
