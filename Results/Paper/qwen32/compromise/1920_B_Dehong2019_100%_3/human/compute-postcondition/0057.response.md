Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `x + k - 1`, `ans1` is increased by `a[i]` and then decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`, `ans2` remains as calculated in the previous iteration.**

In simpler terms, `ans1` has been updated by subtracting `2 * a[i + x]` from its previous value, which was increased by `a[i]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
