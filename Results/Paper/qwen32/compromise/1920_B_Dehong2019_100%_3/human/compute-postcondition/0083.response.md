Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input and greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the new input, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is the third integer read from the new input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `2x + k - 1`, `_` is incremented by `x`. `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `sum(a) - 2 * (a[x + k - 1] + a[x + k] + ... + a[2x + k - 2])`. If `i + x` is less than `n`, then `ans1` is updated to `sum(a) - 2 * (a[x + k - 1] + a[x + k] + ... + a[2x + k - 2]) + a[i] - 4 * a[i + x]`. Otherwise, `ans1` is updated to `ans1 + a[i] - 2 * a[i + x]`.**
