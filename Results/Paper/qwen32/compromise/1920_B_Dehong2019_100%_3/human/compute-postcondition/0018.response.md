Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `x-1`, and `ans2` is the sum of the elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`. If `i + x` is less than `n`, then `ans1` is the sum of the elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[x-1]` minus twice `a[i + x]`. Otherwise, `ans1` remains undefined.**
