The value of `ans1` is reduced by twice the value of the first element of the list `a` (since `i` is 0). The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and the list `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `x` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the elements in `a` minus twice the first element of `a`, `i` is 0**.
