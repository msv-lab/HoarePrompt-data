The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters as it is defined without any input arguments. It processes a predefined list `s` of integers (0s and 1s) and a counter `n` initialized to 0, which counts the number of 1s in the list. Another variable `ans` is initialized to 0 and is used to accumulate some form of "cost" based on the values in the list. Since the function does not take any parameters and the output description is not provided, we can infer that the function modifies the global variables `s`, `n`, and `ans` and returns nothing explicitly. 

Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes a predefined list `s` of integers (0s and 1s), counts the number of 1s in the list using the variable `n`, and accumulates some form of "cost" in the variable `ans`. It does not accept any parameters and does not return a value explicitly.**
