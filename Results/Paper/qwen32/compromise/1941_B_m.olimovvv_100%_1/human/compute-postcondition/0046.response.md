The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `b`, `a`, `i`, or the output. It only exits the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`b` is a list of integers where `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - 2 * 0`, `b[i + 2]` is `b[i + 2]`; `a` is an input integer and must be greater than 7; the output is 'YES'; `i` is 5 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
