To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which includes the variables `i`, `a`, and the range `(0, a - 2)`.

Here is the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Loop Head Analysis**:
    - The loop iterates over the range `(0, a - 2)`.
    - For the loop to execute at least once, the range must contain at least one integer.
    - The range `(0, a - 2)` contains integers from `0` to `a - 3` (inclusive).

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
    - The range `(0, a - 2)` will be non-empty if `a - 2 > 0`.
    - Simplifying this, we get `a > 2`.

3. **Adjustments**:
    - The only variables we can adjust are `i` and `a` (since `i` is the loop variable and `a` is part of the range definition).
    - Before the loop starts, `a` must be greater than `2` to ensure that the loop executes.
    - The variable `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is initialized by the `range` function.

Given this analysis, the necessary adjustments to the state are:

State: **`b` is a list of integers provided by the input; `a` is an input integer and must be greater than 2; the output is 'YES'**.
