Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and the current element `b[i]` is less than 0; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and the condition that the current element `b[i]` is less than 0 remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
