The code snippet provided modifies the element at index `i + 1` in the list `b` by subtracting twice the value of the element at index `i`. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged, and the loop or if statement is broken out of if `b[i]` is less than 0. However, since the condition to break out of the loop is not met in this specific code snippet, we only consider the modification to `b`.

Given that `b[i + 1]` is updated to `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`, the new value of `b[i + 1]` is directly calculated based on the previous values of `b[i]` and `b[i + 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers where `b[i + 1]` is updated to `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`.**
