To solve this, we need to understand the changes that occur to the list `b` after the given code is executed. The code modifies `b[i + 1]` by subtracting `b[i] * 2` from it. Given that `i` is 2, this means `b[3]` is modified by subtracting `b[2] * 2` from it.

Let's break it down:

- `b[0]` is 0.
- `b[1]` is 0.
- `b[2]` is `b[2] - 2 * b[1]`, which simplifies to `b[2]` since `b[1]` is 0.
- `b[3]` is `b[3] - 3 * b[1]`, which simplifies to `b[3]` since `b[1]` is 0.
- `i` is 2.

The code modifies `b[3]` as follows:
`b[3] -= b[2] * 2`
So, the new value of `b[3]` is `b[3] - 2 * b[2]`.

Since `a` is greater than 4, `b[0]` and `b[1]` remain unchanged, and the condition `if b[i] < 0` (which checks if `b[2] < 0`) does not affect the variables as no break statement is executed if the condition is not met.

Output State: **`a` is greater than 4, `b` is a list of integers where `b[0]` is 0, `b[1]` is 0, `b[2]` is `b[2]`, `b[3]` is `b[3] - 2 * b[2]`, and `i` is 2.**
