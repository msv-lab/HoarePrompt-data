Postcondition: **`a` is greater than 4, `b` is a list of integers where `b[0]` is 0, `b[1]` is 0, `b[2]` is `b[2] - 2 * b[1]`, `b[3]` is `b[3] - 3 * b[1]`, and `i` is 2. If `b[i]` (which is `b[2]`) is less than 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables.**
