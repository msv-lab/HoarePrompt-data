### Reasoning:

The provided Python program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array and applying the allowed operation starting from the first element. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation that make the program incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Indexing and Logic**: The program starts modifying the array from the first element and tries to adjust the subsequent elements based on the current element's value. However, the operation is defined to be applied on indices \(i\) where \(2 \le i \le n-1\). This means the first element should not be modified directly by the operation.

2. **Negative Values**: The program checks if any element becomes negative during the transformation, but this check is not sufficient to determine if the transformation is possible. Even if all elements remain non-negative, it does not guarantee that the array can be transformed to all zeros.

3. **Final Check**: The program checks if the last two elements are zero after the loop. However, this check does not consider if the intermediate elements are zero or if the operation can be applied in a way that results in all elements being zero.

4. **Modification of Elements**: The way elements are modified inside the loop is incorrect. The operation should reduce the current element by 1, the next element by 2, and the following element by 1. The current implementation incorrectly modifies the elements based on multiplication and subtraction, which does not align with the problem statement.

### Correctness:
Based on the above reasoning, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
