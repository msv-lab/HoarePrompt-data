Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer parameter `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. It calculates the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary form and returns this value minus one. If `n` is 0, the function returns -1. However, given the constraints, `n` will never be 0, so the function will always return a non-negative integer representing the bit length of `n` minus one.**
