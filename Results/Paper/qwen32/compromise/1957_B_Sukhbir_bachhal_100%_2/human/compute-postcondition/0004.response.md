The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, which means `n` is already not equal to 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `position` is 0**
