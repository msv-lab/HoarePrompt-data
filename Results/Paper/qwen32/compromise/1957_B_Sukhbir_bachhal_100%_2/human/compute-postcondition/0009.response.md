Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 50000, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `position` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `position` is incremented by 1, so it changes from 1 to 2. The values of `n`, `k`, and `t` remain unchanged.
