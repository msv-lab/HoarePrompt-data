The value of `position` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `t`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `position` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `position` is 1.**
