The code snippet `n >>= 1` performs a bitwise right shift operation on the variable `n`, effectively dividing `n` by 2 and truncating the result to an integer (floor division).

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50000
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `position` is 2

After executing `n >>= 1`, the value of `n` is updated to `n // 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 25000, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `position` is 2.**

The values of `k`, `t`, and `position` remain unchanged. The value of `n` is halved and truncated.
