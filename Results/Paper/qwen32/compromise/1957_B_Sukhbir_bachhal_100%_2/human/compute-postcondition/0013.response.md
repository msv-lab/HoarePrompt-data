To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand what the loop does. The loop repeatedly divides `n` by 2 (using the right shift operator `>>`) until `n` becomes 0, while incrementing `position` by 1 in each iteration. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State**: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `position` is 0.
2. **Loop Operation**: In each iteration, `n` is divided by 2 (integer division), and `position` is incremented by 1.
3. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues until `n` becomes 0.

The value of `position` at the end of the loop will be the number of times we can divide `n` by 2 before it becomes 0. This is equivalent to the number of bits in the binary representation of `n` minus 1 (since the highest bit position is counted).

For example:
- If `n` is 1 (binary `1`), the loop will execute 1 time, and `position` will be 1.
- If `n` is 2 (binary `10`), the loop will execute 2 times, and `position` will be 2.
- If `n` is 3 (binary `11`), the loop will execute 2 times, and `position` will be 2.
- If `n` is 4 (binary `100`), the loop will execute 3 times, and `position` will be 3.

The maximum value of `n` is 2 · 10^5, which in binary is 111010110100010000 (18 bits). Therefore, the maximum number of iterations (and the maximum value of `position`) is 18.

**Final Output State**:
- `n` will be 0.
- `position` will be the number of times `n` can be divided by 2 before it becomes 0, which is the number of bits in `n` minus 1.
- `k` and `t` remain unchanged.

Given the constraints and the nature of the loop, the final state is:

Output State: **n is 0, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and position is the number of bits in the initial n minus 1.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `n` will be 0, `k` and `t` will remain the same, and `position` will reflect how many times `n` was divided by 2 before reaching 0.
