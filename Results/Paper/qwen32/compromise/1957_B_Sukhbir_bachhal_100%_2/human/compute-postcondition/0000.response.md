Postcondition: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The current value of n is 0.**

However, there seems to be a contradiction in the precondition and the if condition. The precondition states that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), but the if condition checks if \(n == 0\). Since \(n\) cannot be 0 according to the precondition, the if condition can never be true under the given precondition. If we assume the if condition is meant to be evaluated despite the precondition, the postcondition would reflect the contradictory state.

If the intention was to have a valid postcondition assuming the if condition could be true, we would need to adjust the precondition to allow \(n\) to be 0. Given the current setup, the postcondition as stated reflects the contradiction:

The number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The current value of n is 0, which contradicts the precondition.**
