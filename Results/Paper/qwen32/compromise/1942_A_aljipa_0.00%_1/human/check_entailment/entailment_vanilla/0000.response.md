Let's analyze the provided program step by step based on the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Sorted Array**: An array is sorted if each element is less than or equal to the next element.
2. **Cyclic Shifts**: A cyclic shift of an array involves rotating the array such that the first element becomes the last, the second becomes the first, and so on.
3. **Task**: Given `n` and `k`, find an array of length `n` where exactly `k` cyclic shifts are sorted.
4. **Constraints**:
   - `1 <= n, k <= 1000`
   - The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed `1000`.
   - If no such array exists, output `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided code snippet handles three specific cases:
1. **k == n**: This means all cyclic shifts must be sorted. The only way this can happen is if all elements in the array are the same.
   - `res = [1] * n` creates an array of length `n` with all elements as `1`.
2. **k == 1**: This means exactly one cyclic shift must be sorted. The simplest way to achieve this is to have an array where the elements are in ascending order, except for a wrap-around that makes only one shift sorted.
   - `res = range(n)` creates an array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`. However, this does not guarantee that only one cyclic shift is sorted. For example, if `n=3`, the cyclic shifts are `[0, 1, 2]`, `[1, 2, 0]`, and `[2, 0, 1]`, all of which are sorted.
3. **Other Cases (k != n and k != 1)**: The code outputs `-1`.
   - `res = [-1]` covers all other cases where `k` is neither `n` nor `1`.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Case `k == 1`**:
   - The current implementation does not correctly handle the case where exactly one cyclic shift should be sorted. The array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]` will have more than one sorted cyclic shift for `n > 1`.
   - A correct approach would be to construct an array where only one cyclic shift is sorted. For example, an array like `[2, 1, 3, 4, ..., n]` could work for `n >= 2`.

2. **General Case**:
   - The program does not cover cases where `1 < k < n`. It should be able to construct an array with exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case where `k == 1` and it does not handle cases where `1 < k < n`.

**Correctness: False**
