Reasoning:
The given program handles the cases where `k` is either `n` or `1` correctly, but it does not handle all possible values of `k` properly. Specifically, the program outputs `-1` for any `k` that is neither `n` nor `1`, which is incorrect because there may be valid arrays for other values of `k`.

- When `k == n`, the program outputs an array of `n` ones, which is correct because all cyclic shifts of this array are sorted.
- When `k == 1`, the program outputs an array of the first `n` non-negative integers (i.e., `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`), which is also correct because only the first cyclic shift is sorted.
- However, the program outputs `-1` for any other value of `k`, which is not necessarily correct. For example, there can be valid arrays for `k` values between `2` and `n-1`.

To handle all possible values of `k`, the program would need to generate valid arrays for `k` in the range `[2, n-1]`. For instance, one approach could be to create an array that has a specific number of sorted cyclic shifts by carefully arranging the elements.

Since the program does not handle all possible values of `k` correctly, it is not entirely correct.

Correctness: **False**
