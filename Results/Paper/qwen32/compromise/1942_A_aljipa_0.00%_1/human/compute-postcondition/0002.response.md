To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop based on the input values of `n` and `k` for each test case.

1. If `k == n`, the result is a list of `n` ones: `[1, 1, ..., 1]`.
2. If `k == 1`, the result is a list of the first `n` non-negative integers: `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`.
3. If `k` is neither equal to `n` nor equal to `1`, the result is a list with a single element `-1`.

Since the loop runs `t` times, and for each iteration, it prints the result based on the values of `n` and `k` provided, the output state will be a series of printed results, one for each test case.

Output State: **For each test case, the output is a list of `n` ones if `k == n`, a list of the first `n` non-negative integers if `k == 1`, and a list with a single element `-1` if `k` is neither `n` nor `1`.**
