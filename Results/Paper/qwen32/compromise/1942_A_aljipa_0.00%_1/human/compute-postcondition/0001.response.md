To ensure that the for loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0 because `range(t)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `t-1`, and the loop will iterate over this sequence.

Given the state before the loop starts: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, the loop will naturally execute because `t` is guaranteed to be at least 1. However, we need to ensure that the state aligns with the loop's requirements.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3**

This state ensures that the loop will execute because `t` is within the specified range, guaranteeing that `range(t)` will produce at least one iteration.
