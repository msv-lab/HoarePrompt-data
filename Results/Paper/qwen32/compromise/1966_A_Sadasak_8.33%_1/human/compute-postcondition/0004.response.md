Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers, and a parameter `k`, which is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100. The function returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is a unique integer from the list `arr`, and each value is the minimum of the count of that integer in `arr` and `k`.**
