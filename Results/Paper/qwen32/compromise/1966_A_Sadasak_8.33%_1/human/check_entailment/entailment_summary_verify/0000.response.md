### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary in the context of the problem description and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the allowed operations any number of times. The key operation is exchanging `k` cards with the same number for `k-1` cards of any chosen numbers.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the details of each test case (number of cards `n`, exchange number `k`, and the list of card numbers).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function is supposed to return a frequency table where each key is a unique card number and the value is the count of that card number, capped at `k`.
   - **Function Summary**: The summary correctly describes `func_1` as returning a frequency table with values capped at `k`.

3. **Logic for Minimum Cards**:
   - The program checks if `k` is in the frequency table values, which is an incorrect condition for determining the minimum number of cards left.
   - The program does not correctly compute the minimum number of cards left by summing the remainders of the frequencies divided by `k`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the frequency of any card number is greater than `k` correctly, as it caps the frequency at `k`.

#### Correct Approach:
- The correct approach is to count the frequency of each card number and then compute the remainder of each frequency divided by `k`. The sum of these remainders gives the minimum number of cards left.

#### Revised Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program based on the correct approach:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in nums:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    min_cards = 0
    for freq in frequency_table.values():
        min_cards += freq % k
    
    print(min_cards)
```

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations. The logic for determining the minimum number of cards is flawed, and the function `func_1` incorrectly caps the frequency at `k`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
