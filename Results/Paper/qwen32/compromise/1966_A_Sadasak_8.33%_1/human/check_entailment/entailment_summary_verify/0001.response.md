Let's systematically analyze the program and the function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the provided function summary.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of cards that can be left after performing a series of operations where we can exchange any `k` cards of the same number for `k-1` cards of any number.

### Key Observations
1. **Base Cases**:
   - If `k > n`, no operations can be performed, so the result is `n`.
   - If `k == n`, one operation can be performed to reduce the count by 1, so the result is `k - 1`.

2. **General Case**:
   - For each card number, count its occurrences in the hand.
   - Determine the minimum number of cards left by performing operations to reduce the count of each card number to the smallest non-negative value that is not a multiple of `k`.

### Program Analysis
Let's analyze the given program to see if it correctly implements the above logic.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `k > n` by printing `n`.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `k == n` by printing `k - 1`.

3. **General Case**:
   - The program defines a function `func_1` to compute the frequency of each card number, but it caps the frequency at `k`. According to the function summary, this function returns a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `arr`, and each value is the minimum of the count of that integer in `arr` and `k`.
   - The program then checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table. If it is, it prints `k - 1`. Otherwise, it prints `n`.

### Issues in the Program
- The function `func_1` incorrectly caps the frequency at `k`. This is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. The correct approach should be to count the frequency of each card number without capping it.
- The check `if k in freq.values()` is not sufficient to determine if an operation can be performed. We need to check if any frequency can be reduced to a multiple of `k` by performing operations.

### Correct Implementation
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Count the frequency of each card number.
- Determine the minimum number of cards left by performing operations to reduce the count of each card number to the smallest non-negative value that is not a multiple of `k`.

### Function Summary Analysis
The function summary states that the function `func_1` returns a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `arr`, and each value is the minimum of the count of that integer in `arr` and `k`. This summary is accurate for the given implementation of `func_1`, but it is not sufficient to solve the problem correctly.

### Conclusion
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is `False`.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
