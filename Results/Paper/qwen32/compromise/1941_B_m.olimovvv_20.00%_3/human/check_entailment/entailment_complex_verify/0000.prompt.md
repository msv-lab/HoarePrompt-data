You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    3
    
    7 1 0
    
    4
    
    1 1 1 1

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or (b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_j satisfies 0 <= a_j <= 10^9. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: A series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each test case, where 'YES' is printed if the first element is even or the second element is exactly two more than the first element when the first is odd, and the last element is even or the second-to-last element is exactly two less than the last element when the last is odd. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it checks a list of integers and prints 'YES' if the first element is even or the second element is exactly two more than the first element when the first is odd, and the last element is even or the second-to-last element is exactly two less than the last element when the last is odd. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all the elements of the array equal to zero using the described operations. The logic in the program is overly simplistic and does not account for the full complexity of the problem.

The program checks only two conditions:
1. If the first element is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2.
2. If the last element is odd and the second last element is not equal to the last element plus 2.

These conditions are not sufficient to determine if the entire array can be reduced to zeros using the given operations. The operations allow for a more complex transformation of the array, and the program does not account for these transformations.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
5
1 3 3 3 1
```
According to the program, the output would be "NO" because `b[0] % 2 == 1` and `b[1] != b[0] + 2`. However, it is actually possible to make all elements zero using the operations:

1. Apply the operation at index 3: `[1, 3, 1, 1, 1]`
2. Apply the operation at index 3 again: `[1, 1, 0, 0, 1]`
3. Apply the operation at index 2: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]`
4. Apply the operation at index 4: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

Thus, the program is incorrect for this case.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all potential cases and is therefore incorrect.
