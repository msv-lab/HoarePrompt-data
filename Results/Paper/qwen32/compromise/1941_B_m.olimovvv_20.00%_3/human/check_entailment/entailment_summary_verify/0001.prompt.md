You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or (b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it checks a list of integers and prints 'YES' if the first element is even or the second element is exactly two more than the first element when the first is odd, and the last element is even or the second-to-last element is exactly two less than the last element when the last is odd. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires determining if it is possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation allows us to choose an index `i` (where `2 <= i <= n - 1`) and modify the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` by subtracting 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

### Key Observations:
1. **Parity Consideration**: The operation always modifies the elements in such a way that the parity (odd/even nature) of the sum of the elements in the array remains unchanged. This is because the total change in the sum due to the operation is `-1 - 2 - 1 = -4`, which is an even number.
2. **Initial Sum Parity**: If the initial sum of the array is odd, it is impossible to make all elements zero because the final sum (which is zero) is even. Therefore, if the sum of the array is odd, the answer should be "NO".
3. **Boundary Conditions**: The program checks the parity of the first and last elements and their immediate neighbors. However, this is not sufficient to determine if the entire array can be reduced to zeros. The correct approach should involve checking the parity of the entire array sum.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program checks the parity of the first and last elements and their immediate neighbors. However, this is not a comprehensive check for the entire array. The program does not calculate the sum of the array to check its parity, which is a crucial step in solving the problem.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the sum of the array.
2. Check if the sum is even. If it is not, print "NO".
3. If the sum is even, further checks might be needed to ensure that the array can be reduced to zeros using the given operation, but the problem can be simplified by checking the parity of the sum.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution as it only checks the parity of the first and last elements and their immediate neighbors, which is insufficient. The correct approach involves checking the parity of the entire array sum.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
