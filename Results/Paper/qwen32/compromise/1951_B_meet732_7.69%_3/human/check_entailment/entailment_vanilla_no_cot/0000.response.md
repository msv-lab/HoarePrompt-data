Correctness: **False**

The given program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Global Variable `n`**: The variable `n` is used inside the `func_1` function, but it is not defined within that function. The value of `n` is only available in the main loop and not passed to `func_1`.

2. **Index `k`**: The index `k` is converted to zero-based indexing by subtracting 1, but this adjustment is not used correctly in the function `func_1`. The function seems to rely on `k` being zero-based, but it is not passed to `func_1`.

3. **Logic for Finding Maximum Wins**: The logic inside `func_1` for determining the maximum number of wins is incorrect. The function does not properly account for the possibility of swapping the cow with another cow to maximize wins. The conditions and calculations do not align with the problem requirements.

4. **Debugging Print Statement**: There is a debugging print statement `if k == 14: print(ind)` which should be removed or commented out for the final solution.

5. **Return Values**: The return values and conditions within `func_1` do not correctly reflect the problem's requirements for determining the maximum wins.

6. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The function does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the cow is already in a position where it can win all matches or when it cannot win any matches.

To correctly solve the problem, the function needs to be redesigned to properly handle the logic of swapping the cow's position and calculating the maximum number of wins based on the cow's rating and the ratings of other cows.
