To determine the output of the `print(ind)` statement, we need to understand the state of the program at the point where the print statement is executed. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State Description**:
   - `a` is a list of integers where the first element `t` represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, there are two integers `n` and `k` followed by a list of `n` integers representing the ratings of cows.
   - `x` is the value of the element at index `k` in the list `a` for each test case.
   - `ind` is a list containing the indices of up to two cows whose ratings are higher than `x`.
   - `c` is the count of cows in `ind`, which is at most 2.
   - The current value of `k` is 14.

2. **Understanding `ind`**:
   - `ind` is a list that stores the indices of cows whose ratings are higher than `x` (the rating of the cow at index `k`).
   - Since the exact values of the ratings and the list `a` are not provided, we know that `ind` will contain the indices of up to two cows with ratings higher than `x`.

3. **Current State**:
   - The current value of `k` is 14.
   - `x` is the rating of the cow at index 14.
   - `ind` contains the indices of up to two cows whose ratings are higher than `x`.

4. **Output Determination**:
   - The `print(ind)` statement will print the list `ind`.
   - Since the exact ratings and their indices are not provided, we can't determine the exact indices in `ind`, but we know that `ind` will contain indices of up to two cows with ratings higher than `x`.

Based on the above analysis, the output will be a list of indices of up to two cows whose ratings are higher than the rating at index 14.

Output: **ind (where ind is a list containing the indices of up to two cows whose ratings are higher than the rating at index 14)**
