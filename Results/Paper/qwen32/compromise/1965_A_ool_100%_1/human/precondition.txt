arr is a list of lists where each sublist contains n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case, and the length of arr is t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Each integer in the sublists is between 1 and 10^9, inclusive. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
