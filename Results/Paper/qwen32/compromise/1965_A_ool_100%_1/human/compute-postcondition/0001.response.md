The code snippet `set_ = list(set(arr))` converts the list `arr` into a set to remove duplicate elements and then converts it back into a list. This operation affects the variable `set_`, which will now hold the unique elements of `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, and the following elements are pairs of integers. For each test case, the first integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) represents the number of piles, and the next `n` integers (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) represent the number of stones in each pile. The total number of piles across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5; `A` is `False`; `set_` is a list of unique integers from `arr`.**
