The function determines the winner of a game based on the movement of a stone on a tree with exactly two leaves. It accepts the number of nodes `n` in the tree, an integer `t` which is always 1, a list of `n-1` edges representing the tree structure, and a starting node for the stone. The function prints either 'Ron' or 'Hermione' depending on whether the stone can reach a leaf in an odd or even number of moves, respectively.
