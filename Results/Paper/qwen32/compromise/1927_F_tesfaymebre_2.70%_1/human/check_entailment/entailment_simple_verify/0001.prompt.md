You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to find a simple cycle in the graph where the weight of the lightest edge is minimal. Here are the key points:
- The graph is undirected, weighted, and can be disconnected.
- Each pair of vertices has at most one edge.
- We need to find a cycle with the minimum weight of its lightest edge.
- The output should include the weight of the lightest edge, the number of vertices in the cycle, and the vertices in traversal order.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices and edges.
   - It then reads the edges and stores them in a dictionary for adjacency list representation and a list for edge weights.

2. **Sorting Edges:**
   - The edges are sorted in descending order based on their weights. This helps in processing the heaviest edges first.

3. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU):**
   - A DSU (also known as Union-Find) data structure is used to detect cycles.
   - When two vertices are connected and already belong to the same set, a cycle is detected.
   - The DSU also keeps track of the minimum edge weight in each set.

4. **Cycle Detection:**
   - When a cycle is detected (i.e., two vertices already belong to the same set), the cycle is noted.
   - The edge with the smallest weight in this cycle is tracked.

5. **Cycle Reconstruction:**
   - A depth-first search (DFS) is performed starting from one of the vertices in the detected cycle to reconstruct the cycle.
   - The DFS ensures that the cycle is simple (no repeated vertices or edges).

6. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the weight of the lightest edge in the cycle, the number of vertices in the cycle, and the vertices in traversal order are printed.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Graph Scope Issue:**
   - The `graph` variable is defined inside the `func_6` function but used in the `dfs` function without being passed as a parameter.
   - This will result in a `NameError` because `graph` is not defined in the scope of `dfs`.

2. **DFS Function:**
   - The `dfs` function uses the `node_v` variable, which is also defined in the `func_6` function.
   - `node_v` should be passed as a parameter to the `dfs` function to avoid scope issues.

3. **Cycle Reconstruction:**
   - The DFS function is supposed to return the cycle starting from `node_u` and ending at `node_v`.
   - However, the `dfs` function returns the path as soon as it finds a cycle, which may not necessarily be the cycle starting from `node_u` and ending at `node_v`.
   - The current implementation may not correctly identify the cycle that includes both `node_u` and `node_v`.

### Correctness

Due to the scope issues and potential issues with cycle reconstruction, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct output.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
