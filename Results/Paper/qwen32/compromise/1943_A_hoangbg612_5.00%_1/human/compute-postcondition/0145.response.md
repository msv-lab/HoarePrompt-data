Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers, `M` is a dictionary with keys as numbers from `N` (or up to the last number before a gap) and values as the count of consecutive occurrences, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is equal to `i`, and `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `cur`, and the condition `M[i]` being less than or equal to `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
