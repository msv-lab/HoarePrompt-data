The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. The values of `N`, `S`, `num` remain unchanged. The output state reflects the updated value of `cur`.

Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is either 0 or equal to the previous `num` + 1, `num` is the next integer in the list `N` after the previous `num`**.
