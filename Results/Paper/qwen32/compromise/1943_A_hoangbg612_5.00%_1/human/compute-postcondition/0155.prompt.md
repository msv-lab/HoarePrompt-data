Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `N` is a sorted list of integers, `M` is a dictionary with keys as numbers from `N` (or up to the last number before a gap) and values as the count of consecutive occurrences, `S` is an input integer (unchanged), `cur` is the last number processed in `N` (or the last number before a gap) incremented by 1 if the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. The sum of the values in `M` equals `S` if `cur` was incremented.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cur):
    if M[i] <= i:
        cur = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `N` is a sorted list of integers, `M` is a dictionary with keys as numbers from `N` (or up to the last number before a gap) and values as the count of consecutive occurrences, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is greater than 0. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, then `cur` is set to `i` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, and `cur` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `N` is a sorted list of integers, `M` is a dictionary with keys as numbers from `N` (or up to the last number before a gap) and values as the count of consecutive occurrences, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is `x + 1`, `i` is `x + 1`. If `M[i] <= i`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `N` is a sorted list of integers, `M` is a dictionary with keys as numbers from `N` (or up to the last number before a gap) and values as the count of consecutive occurrences, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is `x + 1`, and `i` is `x + 2`. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `cur`, and `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
