The code provided is a `break` statement, which does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. Given the initial state, the values of `cur` and `i` are not modified by this statement.

Initial State: `cur` is equal to the incremented value of `i`; `i` is incremented by 1

After executing the `break` statement:
- `cur` remains equal to the incremented value of `i` from the initial state.
- `i` remains incremented by 1 from the initial state.

Output State: **`cur` is equal to the incremented value of `i`; `i` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
