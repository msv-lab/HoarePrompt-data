The only variable in the loop head is `num`, which iterates over the list `N` in the for loop. To ensure that the loop executes, the list `N` must have at least one element. The other variables mentioned (`T`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `S`, `cur`, and `M`) are not directly involved in the execution of this specific for loop and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this, the state should be adjusted such that the list `N` contains at least one element. The other variables can remain as they are since they do not affect the execution of this for loop.

State: **`T` must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` < `n`, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element; `cur` is -1; `M` is an empty dictionary**
