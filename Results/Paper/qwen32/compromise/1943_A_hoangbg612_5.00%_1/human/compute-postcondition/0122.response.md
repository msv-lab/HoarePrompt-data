The only object in the loop head is the variable `num` from the list `N`. We need to adjust the state of `num` for the next iteration. The variables `N`, `S`, `cur`, and `M` are not in the loop head and should not be modified.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer.
- `S` is an input integer.
- `cur` is either -1 or equal to `num`.
- `M` is a dictionary that depends on the comparison between `num` and `cur`.

To execute the loop one more time, we need to consider the next element in the list `N`.

Let's denote the current value of `num` as `num_prev` (which was the last element processed in the previous iteration). The next value of `num` should be the next element in the list `N` after `num_prev`.

Since `N` is a sorted list and we are iterating through it, the next `num` will be the next integer in the sorted order.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `num` is the next integer in the list `N` after `num_prev`.

Given that we do not know the exact values of `N` and `num_prev`, we can only describe the state in terms of the list `N` and the fact that `num` is the next element in the list.

State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is either -1 or equal to the previous `num`, `num` is the next integer in the list `N` after the previous `num`**.
