The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `N`. The variables `i` and `S` are not directly affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **The smallest `i` in the range `[0, cur-1]` such that `M[i] <= i`, or `cur` if no such `i` exists; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
