To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective**: Find the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally.
- **Game Rules**:
  - Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from `a` and deleting them.
  - Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c` while Bob aims to minimize it.
- **MEX Definition**: The smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The array `a` is sorted. This step seems unnecessary for the logic of finding the MEX optimally. Sorting might not be needed if we are counting occurrences directly.

3. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - It iterates through the sorted array and counts occurrences of each number.
   - It keeps track of the current MEX (`cur`) as it goes through the sorted array.

4. **Adjusting MEX**:
   - If the sum of occurrences matches `n`, it increments `cur`.
   - It then checks if the occurrences of any number are less than the number itself and adjusts `cur` accordingly.

### Logic Evaluation:
- The program attempts to find the MEX by counting occurrences and ensuring that each number from `0` to `cur-1` appears at least as many times as its value.
- However, the program does not explicitly account for the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. Instead, it relies on the fact that sorting and counting occurrences should lead to the correct MEX, which is not necessarily the case given the game dynamics.
- The sorting step is not required and could be misleading. The optimal strategy involves understanding that Alice and Bob will try to control the MEX by their choices, but the program does not simulate this interaction.

### Correctness:
The program seems to be attempting to find the MEX by counting occurrences, but it does not correctly simulate the game dynamics where Alice and Bob make strategic choices. The sorting step is unnecessary and does not guarantee the optimal MEX calculation based on the game rules.

**Correctness: False**

The program may work for some cases due to the nature of the problem constraints and the specific input-output pairs provided, but it does not correctly simulate the optimal play of Alice and Bob. Therefore, it is not guaranteed to be correct for all possible inputs.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The program does not correctly simulate the optimal play of Alice and Bob, and the sorting step is unnecessary. The logic for finding the MEX based on counting occurrences does not account for the strategic choices made during the game.
Correctness: **False**
