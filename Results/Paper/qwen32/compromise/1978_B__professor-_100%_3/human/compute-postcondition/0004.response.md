Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates and prints a specific value based on the relationships between `n`, `a`, and `b`. The printed value represents the result of a computation that varies depending on whether `b` is less than or equal to `a`, or if the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, or neither of these conditions.**
