### Reasoning:

The program calculates the maximum profit Bob can make by selling all `n` buns, given the usual price `a` and the promotional price `b` for the first bun. The program considers three scenarios:

1. **`b <= a`**: In this case, the promotional price is less than or equal to the usual price. Selling all buns at the usual price `a` will yield the maximum profit, which is `n * a`.

2. **`b - a >= n`**: Here, the difference between the promotional price and the usual price is large enough to make it beneficial to sell all buns at the promotional price. The profit from selling `n` buns at the promotional price forms an arithmetic series starting from `b` down to `b - n + 1`. The sum of this arithmetic series is given by the formula `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`.

3. **`b - a < n`**: In this scenario, selling all buns at the promotional price is not optimal because the promotional price difference is not large enough to justify selling all buns at the promotional price. Instead, Bob should sell the first `b - a` buns at the promotional price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price. The profit from selling the first `b - a` buns at the promotional price is the sum of the arithmetic series from `b` down to `b - (b - a) + 1`, which is `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2`. The profit from selling the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price is `a * (n - (b - a))`. The total profit is the sum of these two parts.

The program correctly handles all three scenarios and prints the maximum possible profit for each test case.
