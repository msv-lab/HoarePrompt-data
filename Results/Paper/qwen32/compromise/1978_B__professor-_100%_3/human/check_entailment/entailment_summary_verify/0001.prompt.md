You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

Input

    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates and prints a specific value based on the relationships between `n`, `a`, and `b`. The printed value represents the result of a computation that varies depending on whether `b` is less than or equal to `a`, or if the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, or neither of these conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's examine the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding:
Bob is selling `n` buns. For the first `k` buns, he can sell them at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b-k+1`. The remaining `n-k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`. The goal is to find the maximum profit Bob can make.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of buns), `a` (usual price of a bun), and `b` (price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price).

2. **Logic:**
   - The program first checks if `b <= a`. If true, it means the modified price is not beneficial, so Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a`. The profit is `n * a`.
   - If `b - a >= n`, it implies that the modified price difference is large enough to benefit from selling all buns at the modified price. The sum of the first `n` terms of the sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \((2b - n + 1) * n // 2\).
   - If `b - a < n`, it means the modified price difference is not enough to benefit from selling all buns at the modified price, but there's still a benefit from selling some buns at the modified price. The program calculates the profit by selling `b - a` buns at the modified price and the rest at the usual price `a`. The sum of the first `b - a` terms of the sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2\). The profit from the remaining buns is `a * n`.

### Testing the Logic:
Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `4 4 5`
   - Since `b - a = 1` and `n = 4`, the optimal `k` is 1 (as `b - a < n`). So, the profit is \(5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17\), which matches the output.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `5 5 9`
   - Since `b - a = 4` and `n = 5`, the optimal `k` is 5 (as `b - a < n`). So, the profit is \(9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35\), which matches the output.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `10 10 5`
   - Since `b <= a`, the profit is \(10 * 10 = 100\), which matches the output.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `5 5 11`
   - Since `b - a = 6` and `n = 5`, the optimal `k` is 5 (as `b - a >= n`). So, the profit is \(11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 = 45\), which matches the output.

5. **Example 5:**
   - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
   - Since `b = a`, the profit is \(1000000000 * 1000000000\), which matches the output.

6. **Example 6:**
   - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1`
   - Since `b <= a`, the profit is \(1000000000 * 1000000000\), which matches the output.

7. **Example 7:**
   - Input: `1000 1 1000`
   - Since `b - a = 999` and `n = 1000`, the optimal `k` is 999 (as `b - a < n`). So, the profit is the sum of the first 999 terms of the sequence starting from 1000 and decreasing by 1 each time plus `1 * 1000`. This matches the output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given conditions.
