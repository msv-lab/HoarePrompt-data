The code snippet concatenates the `digits` list with the `letters` list and then joins them into a single string, which is assigned to the variable `sortedPassword`. The original `password`, `digits`, and `letters` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `digits` is a list containing all the digit characters from the password in sorted order; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the password in sorted order; `sortedPassword` is a string formed by concatenating the sorted `digits` and `letters` lists.**
