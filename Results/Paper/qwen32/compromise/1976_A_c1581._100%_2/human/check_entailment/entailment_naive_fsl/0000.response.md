Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly handle the condition that "there should be no digit that comes after a letter." The function `func_1` does not check this condition explicitly. Instead, it checks if the digits and letters are sorted and then compares the sorted string with the original password. However, this approach does not ensure that no digit appears after a letter in the original password.

Consider the following counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
5
a1b2c3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation of the Counterexample:**
In the password "a1b2c3", the digit '1' comes after the letter 'a', and the digit '2' comes after the letter 'b', and the digit '3' comes after the letter 'c'. This violates the condition that no digit should come after a letter. However, the function `func_1` would return `True` for this input because the digits and letters are individually sorted.

The correct approach should be to iterate through the password and ensure that once a letter is encountered, no digit should follow it. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    digit_encountered = False
    
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            if digit_encountered:
                return False
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            digit_encountered = True
            letters.append(char)
    
    if digits != sorted(digits) or letters != sorted(letters):
        return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected function first checks if a digit appears after a letter and then checks if the digits and letters are sorted.
