You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program:
testCases = int(input())
while testCases:
    length = int(input())
    password = input()
    print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')
    testCases -= 1

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if sortedPassword == password:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` checks if the input `password` is already sorted such that all digit characters come before all lowercase Latin letter characters, and both groups are individually sorted in ascending order. It returns `True` if the password meets these criteria, otherwise it returns `False`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly handle the condition that "there should be no digit that comes after a letter." The function `func_1` does not check this condition explicitly. Instead, it checks if the digits and letters are sorted and then compares the sorted string with the original password. However, this approach does not ensure that no digit appears after a letter in the original password.

Consider the following counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
5
a1b2c3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation of the Counterexample:**
In the password "a1b2c3", the digit '1' comes after the letter 'a', and the digit '2' comes after the letter 'b', and the digit '3' comes after the letter 'c'. This violates the condition that no digit should come after a letter. However, the function `func_1` would return `True` for this input because the digits and letters are individually sorted.

The correct approach should be to iterate through the password and ensure that once a letter is encountered, no digit should follow it. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    digit_encountered = False
    
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            if digit_encountered:
                return False
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            digit_encountered = True
            letters.append(char)
    
    if digits != sorted(digits) or letters != sorted(letters):
        return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected function first checks if a digit appears after a letter and then checks if the digits and letters are sorted.
