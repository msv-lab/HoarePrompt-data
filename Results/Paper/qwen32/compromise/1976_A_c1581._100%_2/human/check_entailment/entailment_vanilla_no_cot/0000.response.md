Correctness: **False**

The given program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Digit and Letter Order Check**: The program checks if digits are sorted and letters are sorted, but it does not correctly verify that no digit comes after a letter, which is a crucial condition for a strong password.

2. **Comparison Logic**: The comparison `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]` is incorrect. It should check if a digit comes after a letter in the original password, not just compare the last digit with each letter.

3. **Sorting Logic**: The logic for sorting and comparing the password should be reconsidered. The program should first check if the password is in the correct format (digits followed by letters) and then check if each part is sorted.

Here's a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    found_letter = False
    
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            if found_letter:
                return False  # A digit comes after a letter
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            found_letter = True
            letters.append(char)
    
    # Check if digits and letters are sorted
    if digits != sorted(digits) or letters != sorted(letters):
        return False
    
    return True
```

This function correctly checks that no digit comes after a letter and that both digits and letters are sorted.
