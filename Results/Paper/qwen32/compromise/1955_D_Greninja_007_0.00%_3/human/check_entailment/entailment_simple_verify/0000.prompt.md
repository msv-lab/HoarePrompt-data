You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program implements a sliding window approach to efficiently count the number of good subarrays in array `a` that can be rearranged to match at least `k` elements of array `b`. Here's a breakdown of the logic and why it works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `b_freq` is a frequency counter for the elements in array `b`.
   - `window_freq` is a frequency counter for the first `m` elements in array `a`.
   - `matches` is calculated by summing the minimum of `window_freq[x]` and `b_freq[x]` for each element `x` in `window_freq` that exists in `b_freq`.

2. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program iterates through the array `a` with a sliding window of size `m`.
   - For each step, it checks if the current window (subarray) has at least `k` matching elements with array `b` by comparing `matches` with `k`.
   - If `matches` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the count of good subarrays.
   - It then updates the `window_freq` by removing the frequency of the element that is sliding out of the window (`a[i]`) and adding the frequency of the new element that is sliding into the window (`a[i + m]`).
   - The `matches` count is updated accordingly based on these changes.

3. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, the program performs a final check on the last window to ensure it is considered.

### Correctness Justification:

- The sliding window mechanism ensures that each subarray of length `m` is checked exactly once, making the solution efficient.
- The use of `Counter` from the `collections` module allows for efficient frequency counting and updating.
- The logic to update `matches` ensures that the count of matching elements is correctly maintained as the window slides through the array.
- The program handles all edge cases, including:
  - When `k` is 1 (every subarray is trivially good if it has at least one element in common with `b`).
  - When `k` is equal to `m` (every subarray must match all elements of `b`).
  - When `b` contains duplicate elements.
  - When `a` contains duplicate elements.

Given the problem constraints and the provided solution, no edge case or input scenario is likely to cause the program to fail. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases as per the problem description.
