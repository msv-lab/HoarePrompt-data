3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list `a` of `n` integers, a list `b` of `m` integers, and an integer `k`. It returns the count of subarrays of length `m` in list `a` that have at least `k` elements in common with list `b`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to solve the problem of counting the number of good subsegments of array `a` of length `m` that can be rearranged to match at least `k` elements of array `b`.

Let's break down the program step by step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, which represent the length of array `a`, the length of array `b`, and the minimum number of matching elements required, respectively.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Counting Good Subarrays:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with the arrays `a` and `b`, along with the integers `k`, `n`, and `m`.
   - Inside `func_1`, a `Counter` from the `collections` module is used to count the frequency of each element in `b` (`b_freq`).
   - Another `Counter` is used to count the frequency of the first `m` elements of `a` (`window_freq`).
   - The number of matching elements between `window_freq` and `b_freq` is calculated using a generator expression inside the `sum` function. This counts the minimum frequency of each element that appears in both `window_freq` and `b_freq`.

3. **Sliding Window Technique:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to efficiently count good subarrays:
     - It iterates over the array `a` from index `0` to `n - m - 1`.
     - For each position, it checks if the current window (subarray of length `m`) has at least `k` matching elements with `b`. If so, it increments the `good_subarrays` counter.
     - It then updates the `window_freq` by removing the element that is sliding out of the window and adding the new element that is sliding into the window.
     - The `matches` counter is updated accordingly to reflect the changes in the window.

4. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, the program performs a final check on the last window to see if it is good and updates the `good_subarrays` counter if necessary.

5. **Output:**
   - The function returns the count of good subarrays for each test case, which is then printed.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the sliding window technique to count the number of good subarrays efficiently. It ensures that the frequency of elements in the current window is compared with the frequency of elements in `b` to determine if the window is good. The use of `Counter` helps in efficiently keeping track of frequencies and updating them as the window slides.

The program handles all edge cases, such as when `k` is equal to `m` (all elements in the window must match `b`), and when `k` is `1` (only one element in the window needs to match `b`). It also handles the case where the elements in `a` and `b` are not unique.

Given the constraints, the sliding window approach ensures that the program runs in linear time relative to the total number of elements in all test cases, making it efficient and suitable for the problem.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
