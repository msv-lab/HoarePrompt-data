a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), b is a list of m integers (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), k is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ m), and n and m are integers such that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5 and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Each element in a and b is an integer between 1 and 10^6, inclusive.
