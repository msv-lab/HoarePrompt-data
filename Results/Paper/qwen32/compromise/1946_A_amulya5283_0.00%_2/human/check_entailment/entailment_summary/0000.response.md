### Reasoning:

The program aims to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of an array. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness of the program:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted to identify the median. The median is the middle element in the sorted array (or the average of the two middle elements if the array length is even). However, in this problem, the median is always the element at the index `ceil(n/2)`, which simplifies to `n//2` in zero-based indexing.

2. **Heap Initialization**: The heap is initialized with elements from the median index to the end of the array. This is because the goal is to ensure that the median (and any larger elements that could influence the median position after sorting) is increased.

3. **Heap Operations**: The heap is used to efficiently find and increment the smallest element in the heap until all elements in the heap are greater than the initial median. The smallest element is repeatedly popped, incremented by 1, and pushed back into the heap. Each increment counts as one operation.

4. **Counting Operations**: The number of operations required is counted and stored for each test case.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Median Calculation**: The median is correctly identified as the element at index `n//2` in the sorted array.
- **Heap Usage**: The heap is correctly used to find and increment the smallest elements, ensuring that the median is increased.
- **Operation Count**: The number of operations is accurately counted and returned for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of each array. The execution summary aligns with the intended behavior of the program, and no logical errors are apparent.

### Correctness:
**True**
