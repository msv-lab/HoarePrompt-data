Let's carefully analyze the program and the provided function summary to ensure the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to increase the median of an array by performing the minimum number of operations, where each operation consists of incrementing any element of the array by 1.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the arrays for each test case.
2. **Sorting**: For each test case, the array is sorted.
3. **Median Calculation**: The median is correctly identified based on the sorted array. For an array of length `n`, the median is at index `n // 2`.
4. **Heap Usage**: The program uses a min-heap to track the smallest elements starting from the median index. This is correct because we are interested in increasing the median.
5. **Incrementing Elements**: The program continuously increments the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median. This ensures that the median is increased by at least 1 with the minimum number of operations.
6. **Counting Operations**: The number of increments (operations) is counted and stored as the result for each test case.

### Function Summary:
The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers. For each test case, it calculates the number of operations needed to ensure that all elements in the list, starting from the median, are greater than the initial median value. The function returns a list of these operation counts, one for each test case.

### Correctness Verification:
- **Heap Initialization**: The heap is initialized with elements from the median index to the end of the sorted array. This is correct because we are interested in increasing the median, and the smallest elements in this range are the ones that can potentially be increased to raise the median.
- **Increment Logic**: The program correctly increments the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median. This ensures that the median is increased by at least 1 with the minimum number of operations.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles arrays of different lengths (odd and even) and arrays with duplicate elements correctly.

### Detailed Reasoning:
1. **Median Calculation**:
   - For an array of odd length `n`, the median is at index `n // 2`.
   - For an array of even length `n`, the median is also at index `n // 2` (the smaller of the two middle elements).

2. **Heap Usage**:
   - The heap is initialized with elements from the median index to the end of the sorted array. This ensures that we are focusing on the elements that can potentially increase the median.

3. **Increment Logic**:
   - The program continuously increments the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median. This is correct because we need to ensure that the median is increased by at least 1 with the minimum number of operations.
   - The heap ensures that we are always incrementing the smallest element in the range, which is the most efficient way to increase the median.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles arrays of different lengths (odd and even) and arrays with duplicate elements correctly.
   - For example, in the case of an array with all elements being the same, the program will correctly determine that all elements need to be incremented until the median is increased.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. It handles all specified edge cases and constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Final: True**
