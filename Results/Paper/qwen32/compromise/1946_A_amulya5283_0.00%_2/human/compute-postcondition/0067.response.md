Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n and a list of n integers a_i, results is a list containing the value of operations for each test case, i is equal to t, n and arr are the values from the last tuple in test_cases, arr is sorted in non-decreasing order, median_index is n // 2, current_median is arr[median_index], heap is a heapified version of arr[median_index:] where the smallest element is greater than current_median, operations is the total number of operations performed in the last test case.**

In simpler terms, the loop has finished executing for all `t` test cases. The `results` list now contains the number of operations required for each test case. The variables `i`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`, `heap`, and `operations` reflect the state of the last test case processed by the loop.
