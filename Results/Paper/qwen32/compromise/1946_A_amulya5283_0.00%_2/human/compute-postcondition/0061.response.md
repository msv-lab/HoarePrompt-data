To ensure that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head. The loop head condition is `heap[0] <= current_median`. Therefore, we need to make sure that after the previous iteration, `heap[0]` is still less than or equal to `current_median`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`
- `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` for the current test case
- `n` and `arr` are the values from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order
- `median_index` is `n // 2`
- `current_median` must be at least `smallest + 1`
- `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1`
- `operations` is 2
- `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from `heap`
- `heap` now includes `smallest + 1`

We need to adjust `heap[0]` and `current_median` such that `heap[0] <= current_median`.

Since `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1`, `heap[0]` is the smallest element in `heap`. To ensure the loop condition is met, we need to make sure that `heap[0]` (which is `smallest + 1` after the previous iteration) is less than or equal to `current_median`.

Let's assume that after the previous iteration, `heap[0]` is `smallest + 1`. To keep the loop condition `heap[0] <= current_median` true, we need to ensure that `current_median` is at least `smallest + 1`.

Therefore, we do not need to change `heap[0]` but we need to ensure that `current_median` is at least `smallest + 1`. Since it is already given that `current_median` must be at least `smallest + 1`, no further adjustment is needed.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` for the current test case, `n` and `arr` are the values from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` must be at least `smallest + 1`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1`, `operations` is 2, `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from `heap`, `heap` now includes `smallest + 1`**
