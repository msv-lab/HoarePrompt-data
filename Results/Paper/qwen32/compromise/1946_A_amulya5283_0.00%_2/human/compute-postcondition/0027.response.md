The code snippet assigns the value at the `median_index` of the sorted list `arr` to the variable `current_median`. Since `median_index` is calculated as `n // 2`, the value at this index in `arr` will be the median of the list `arr`.

Given that `arr` is already sorted, the value at `arr[median_index]` is directly assigned to `current_median`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`.**
