To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we focus on the loop condition, which is `heap[0] <= current_median`. This means that for the loop to continue executing, the smallest element in the `heap` (i.e., `heap[0]`) must be less than or equal to the `current_median`.

Given the current state:
- `heap[0]` is the smallest element in `heap`.
- `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, where `median_index` is `n // 2`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need `heap[0]` to be less than or equal to `current_median`. Therefore, we need to adjust either `heap[0]` or `current_median` accordingly.

Since we can only adjust objects in the loop head, and `heap[0]` is derived from the `heap` and `current_median` is derived from `arr`, we can adjust `heap[0]` directly to be less than or equal to `current_median`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a min-heap of the elements from `arr` starting from `median_index` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1` minus the smallest element that was just popped, `operations` is 2, `smallest` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before it was popped, and `heap` now includes the value `smallest + 1` and `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`**.
