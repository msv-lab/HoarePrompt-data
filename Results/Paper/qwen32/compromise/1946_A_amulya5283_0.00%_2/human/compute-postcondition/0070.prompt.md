You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of n integers a_i such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n, arr = test_cases[i]
        
        arr.sort()
        
        median_index = n // 2
        
        current_median = arr[median_index]
        
        heap = arr[median_index:]
        
        heapq.heapify(heap)
        
        operations = 0
        
        while heap[0] <= current_median:
            smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)
            heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)
            operations += 1
        
        results.append(operations)
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n and a list of n integers a_i, results is a list containing the value of operations for each test case, i is equal to t, n and arr are the values from the last tuple in test_cases, arr is sorted in non-decreasing order, median_index is n // 2, current_median is arr[median_index], heap is a heapified version of arr[median_index:] where the smallest element is greater than current_median, operations is the total number of operations performed in the last test case.
    return results
    #The program returns the list 'results' which contains the value of operations for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list `test_cases` where each element is a tuple. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`. The function returns a list `results`, where each element corresponds to the result of an operation performed on the list of integers `a_i` for each test case.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list 'results' which contains the value of operations for each test case.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
