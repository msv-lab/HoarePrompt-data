Postcondition: **`b` is a list with `2 * (n - 1)` elements, `u` is a truthy value greater than 0 and is now `u - 1`, `c` is the first value returned by `r()`, and `d` is the second value returned by `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.**
