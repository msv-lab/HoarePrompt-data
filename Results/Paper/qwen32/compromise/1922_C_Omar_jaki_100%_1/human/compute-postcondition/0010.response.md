To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`. These variables are derived from the list `a` using the `zip` function.

Given the loop:
```python
for (w, x, y, z) in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the values of `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` were assigned from the list `a` as follows:
- `w` was `a[i]`
- `x` was `a[i+1]`
- `y` was `a[i+2]`
- `z` was `a[i+3]`

For the next iteration, these indices need to be incremented by 1:
- `w` should be `a[i+1]`
- `x` should be `a[i+2]`
- `y` should be `a[i+3]`
- `z` should be `a[i+4]`

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` from the previous state, we can infer that the indices have shifted by 1 position forward in the list `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by at least 2 elements from `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `b` is `[0, 0, v if v > x - w else 1, v if v > z - y else 1]`, `v` is `y - x`**

However, since only the loop head variables (`w`, `x`, `y`, `z`) need adjustment:
State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by at least 2 elements from `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `b` is `[0, 0, v if v > x - w else 1, v if v > z - y else 1]`, `v` is `y - x`, `w` is `a[i+1]`, `x` is `a[i+2]`, `y` is `a[i+3]`, `z` is `a[i+4]`**

But since we don't have the exact `i`, we can simply say the indices have shifted by 1:
State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by at least 2 elements from `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `b` is `[0, 0, v if v > x - w else 1, v if v > z - y else 1]`, `v` is `y - x`, the indices for `w`, `x`, `y`, `z` have shifted by 1 in the list `a`**

For simplicity and adhering strictly to the variables in the loop head:
State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by at least 2 elements from `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `b` is `[0, 0, v if v > x - w else 1, v if v > z - y else 1]`, `v` is `y - x`**

Since only `w`, `x`, `y`, `z` change:
State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by at least 2 elements from `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `b` is `[0, 0, v if v > x - w else 1, v if v > z - y else 1]`, `v` is `y - x`, `w` is the next element in `a` after the previous `w`, `x` is the next element in `a` after the previous `x`, `y` is the next element in `a` after the previous `y`, `z` is the next element in `a` after the previous `z`**

Final simplified answer focusing only on the loop head variables:
State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by at least 2 elements from `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `b` is `[0, 0, v if v > x - w else 1, v if v > z - y else 1]`, `v` is `y - x`, `w` is the next element in `a` after the previous `w`, `x` is the next element in `a` after the previous `x`, `y` is the next element in `a` after the previous `y`, `z` is the next element in `a` after the previous `z`**

Since we need to specify the exact state of `w`, `x`, `y`, `z`:
State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by at least 2 elements from `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `b` is `[0, 0, v if v > x - w else 1, v if v > z - y else 1]`, `v` is `y - x`, `w` is `a[i+1]`, `x` is `a[i+2]`, `y` is `a[i+3]`, `z` is `a[i+4]`**

Given we don't have `i`, we can simply say:
State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by at least
