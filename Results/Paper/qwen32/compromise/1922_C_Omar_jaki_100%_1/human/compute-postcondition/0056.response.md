The value of `u` is decremented by 1. The list remains unchanged as it is not affected by the operation on `u`. The output state reflects the updated value of `u` while keeping the list as it was initially defined.

Output State: **`u` is a non-zero value minus 1, the list is `[0, 0, y - x, y - x, y - x + v, y - x + v, y - x + v]`**
