`t -= 1` means `t` is decremented by 1. Given that `t` is initially `True`, which is equivalent to `1` in a numerical context, subtracting `1` from `t` results in `0`. In a boolean context, `0` is equivalent to `False`.

The values of `b` and `u` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`b` is a list with `2 * (n - 1)` elements, `u` is 0, and `t` is False**.
