To determine the output state, we need to consider the function call `r()`. Since the definition of the function `r()` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact changes it might make to the variables `b`, `u`, and `t`.

However, we can assume that the function `r()` could potentially modify any of the variables `b`, `u`, and `t`. Without knowing the specifics of `r()`, we can only state that these variables may have been altered.

Given the lack of details about `r()`, the most accurate description we can provide is that the function `r()` was called, and its effects on `b`, `u`, and `t` are unknown.

Output State: **`b` is a list with `2 * (n - 1)` elements, `u` is possibly modified, `t` is possibly modified, and `r()` has been called.**
