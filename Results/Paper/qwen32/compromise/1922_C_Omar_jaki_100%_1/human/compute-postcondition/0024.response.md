Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `b` is a list with `2 * (n - 1)` elements.
- `u` is the initial truthy value decreased by 1 (though `u` is not used in the print statement).
- `c` is the first value returned by `r()`.
- `d` is the second value returned by `r()`.
- `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
```

### Explanation:
1. **List `b`:** 
   - The list `b` has `2 * (n - 1)` elements. This means it has an even number of elements, specifically `2n - 2` elements.
   
2. **Indices Calculation:**
   - The expression `c * 2 - 1` calculates an index for the list `b`. Since `c` is an integer, `c * 2 - 1` will always result in an odd index (because multiplying an integer by 2 results in an even number, and subtracting 1 from an even number results in an odd number).
   - Similarly, `d * 2 - 1` calculates another odd index for the list `b`.

3. **Values at Indices:**
   - `b[c * 2 - 1]` refers to the element at the odd index `c * 2 - 1` in the list `b`.
   - `b[d * 2 - 1]` refers to the element at the odd index `d * 2 - 1` in the list `b`.

4. **Subtraction:**
   - The print statement subtracts the value at index `d * 2 - 1` from the value at index `c * 2 - 1`.

### Output Description:
The output will be the difference between the elements at the indices `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1` in the list `b`.

Given the information, the exact numerical values of `b[c * 2 - 1]` and `b[d * 2 - 1]` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values in the list `b` and the values of `c` and `d`. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the given conditions.

Output: **b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1] (where `c` and `d` are values returned by `r()` such that `c >= d`, and `b` is a list with `2 * (n - 1)` elements)**
