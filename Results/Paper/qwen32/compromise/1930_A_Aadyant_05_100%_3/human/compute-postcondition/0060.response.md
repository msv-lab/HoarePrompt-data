The code snippet `list2.append(int(str))` appends the integer value of `str` to the list `list2`. This means that the value of `list2` will change to include the new integer value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is 0
- `n` and `t` remain unchanged
- `final` includes the value of `s` (before it was reset) appended to it
- `num` is the previous value of `num` plus 1
- `list2` is a list containing the integer value of `str` appended to its previous contents
- `a` is the user input string
- `list1` is a list of words from the string `b` that must have at least one word
- `str` is the next word in `list1`

After executing the code snippet, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is 0; `n`, `t` remain unchanged; `final` includes the value of `s` (before it was reset) appended to it; `num` is the previous value of `num` plus 1; `list2` is a list containing the integer value of `str` appended to its previous contents; `a` is the user input string; `list1` is a list of words from the string `b` that must have at least one word; `str` is the next word in `list1`.**

In natural language, the integer value of `str` has been appended to `list2`. All other variables retain their previous values.
