The value of `s` is updated to be the sum of its previous value and the integer value at index `i` of `list2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is `s + int(list2[i])`; `n`, `t`, `final`, `num`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged; `list2` is a sorted list of integer values of all words in `list1` and must have at least one element.**
