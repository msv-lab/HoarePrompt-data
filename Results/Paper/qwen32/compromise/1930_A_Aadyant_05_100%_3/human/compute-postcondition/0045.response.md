To determine the Output State, we need to focus on the variable `s` and how it is affected by the given code snippet. The variable `s` is updated twice in the initial state description, and then it is updated again by the code snippet provided.

1. Initially, `s` is updated to `s + int(list2[2])`.
2. Then, `s` is updated to `s + int(list2[4])`.
3. Finally, the code snippet `s = s + int(list2[i])` is executed, where `i` is 4.

Since `i` is 4, the code snippet effectively adds `int(list2[4])` to `s` again. Therefore, the final value of `s` will be the initial value of `s` plus `int(list2[2])` plus `int(list2[4])` plus `int(list2[4])`.

In natural language, this means that `s` is now equal to its initial value plus the integer value of the third element of `list2` plus twice the integer value of the fifth element of `list2`.

Output State: **`b` is the new input string provided by the user that must contain at least one non-whitespace character, `list1` is a list of words from `b` that must have at least one element, `i` is 4, `s` is now equal to its initial value plus `int(list2[2])` plus `2 * int(list2[4])`.**
