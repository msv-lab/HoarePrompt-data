To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop iterates over the `final` list. The loop iterates over each element in the `final` list and prints it. The output states provided indicate that the loop has executed a number of times corresponding to the number of elements in the `final` list up to that point.

Given the initial state and the descriptions of the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the `final` list contains `int(n)` elements, where `n` is the number of iterations the loop will execute. Since the loop prints each element of the `final` list, after all iterations, every element in `final` will have been printed.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations will be that all elements of the `final` list have been printed. Since the problem does not specify the actual values in the `final` list, we can only describe the state in terms of the list's contents being fully printed.

Output State: **All elements of the `final` list have been printed.**
