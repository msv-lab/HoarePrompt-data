To determine what will be printed by the `print(fin)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the context of the variables involved.

### Initial State:
- `final` is a list containing at least two elements.
- `fin` is the next element in the list `final`.

### Key Points:
- Since `final` contains at least two elements, we can infer that `final` has indices 0, 1, 2, and so on.
- The variable `fin` is described as "the next element in the list `final`." Given that no specific index is mentioned for the first element in `final`, we can assume that `fin` refers to the second element (index 1) of the list `final`.

### Conclusion:
- The variable `fin` holds the value of the second element of the list `final`.

### Output:
Since we don't have the exact values of the elements in the list `final`, we can only describe the output in terms of the list's elements.

Output: **fin (where fin is the second element of the list `final`)**
