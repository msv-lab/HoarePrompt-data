The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(list2)`. Since the loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration, we need to adjust `i` to the next value that satisfies the loop condition. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was used to access an element in `list2`, and `len(list2)` remains unchanged.

Given that `i` was used to access `list2[i]` in the previous iteration, the next value of `i` should be `i + 2` to satisfy the loop condition `i in range(0, len(list2), 2)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `i` incremented by 2.

State: **`s` is `s + int(list2[i])`; `n`, `t`, `final`, `num`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged; `list2` is a sorted list of integer values of all words in `list1` and must have at least one element; `i` is `i + 2`**
