The code snippet provided initializes an empty list `pl`. No other variables are modified in the given code.

Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w`, `w` must be greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input, `pl` is an empty list**.

In natural language: The variable `t` retains the value of the input integer `w` (which is greater than 0), `ln` retains its value as an input integer, `palka` retains its value as a list of integers from the input, and `pl` is now an empty list.
