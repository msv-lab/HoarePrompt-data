The only variable in the loop head is `j` and the iterable `pl`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `j` must be updated to the next value in `pl`.

Given that `t` is unchanged and `shapes` is updated based on the condition `d[j] >= 3`, we only need to adjust `j` to the next element in `pl` for the next iteration of the loop.

State: **`t` is unchanged, `shapes` is `shapes` + `d[j] // 3` if `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `shapes` remains unchanged, and `pl` is a non-empty iterable, `j` is the next value in `pl`**
