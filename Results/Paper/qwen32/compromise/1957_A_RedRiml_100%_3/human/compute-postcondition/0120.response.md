To determine what will be printed by the `print(shapes)` statement, we need to understand the calculation of the `shapes` variable based on the given initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `t` is unchanged.
- `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`.
- `w` is `w - len(palka)`.
- `ln` is unchanged.
- `palka` is unchanged.
- `pl` is unchanged.
- `d` is unchanged.

From this, we can deduce that `shapes` is calculated by iterating over the indices specified in the list `pl` and summing up the integer division of `d[j]` by 3, but only for those indices `j` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.

Since the exact values of `d`, `pl`, `palka`, `w`, `ln`, and `t` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `shapes`. However, we can provide a precise description of what `shapes` represents based on the given information.

The `print(shapes)` statement will output the calculated value of `shapes` which is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`.

Output: **shapes (where shapes is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`)**
