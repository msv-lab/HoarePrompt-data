Postcondition: **`t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w - 1`, where `w` is greater than 1; `ln` is the new input integer; `palka` is a new list of integers from the input and must have at least 1 element; `pl` is a list that may or may not contain the value `i`, but if `i` was not in `pl` before, it is now added; `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3` (recalculated considering the new value of `d[i]`); `d[i]` is set to 1 if it was `None` before, otherwise it is incremented by 1; `i` is the next element in `palka`.**

This postcondition summarizes the behavior of the if-else block, noting that regardless of whether `d[i]` was initially `None` or had a value, it will be set to 1 or incremented by 1, respectively, and that the other variables remain consistent with their described states.
