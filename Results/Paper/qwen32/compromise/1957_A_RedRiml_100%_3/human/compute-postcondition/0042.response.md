The code snippet `ln = int(input())` takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `ln`. The other variables (`t`, `palka`, `d`, `pl`, and `shapes`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w - 1`, where `w` is greater than 1; `ln` is the new input integer; `palka` is a list of integers from the input; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `palka` and the corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `palka`; `pl` is a list that contains each unique integer from `palka` in the order they first appear; `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`.**
