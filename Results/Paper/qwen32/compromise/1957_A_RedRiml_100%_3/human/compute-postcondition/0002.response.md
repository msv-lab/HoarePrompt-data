`ln` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is still assigned the value of the input integer `w`, and `w` must still be greater than 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w`, `w` must be greater than 0, and `ln` is an input integer.
Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w`, `w` must be greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer**.
