The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `palka`. The initial state specifies that `t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w`, where `w` must be greater than 0, and `ln` is an input integer. After executing the code, `palka` will hold the list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w`, `w` must be greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input.**
