The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. Since `d.get(i)` was `None` before, this means that `i` was not a key in the dictionary `d` before this operation. After the assignment, `d` will have `i` as a key with the value `1`. The other variables (`t`, `ln`, `palka`, and `pl`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w`, where `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers from the input that has at least 1 integer; `pl` is an empty list; `d` is a dictionary with the key `i` having the value `1`.**
