Output State: **`t` is unchanged; `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3; `w` is `w - 1`; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The variable `palka` is newly introduced and assigned a list of integers from the input. The other variables `t`, `shapes`, `w`, and `ln` remain unchanged except for `w` which is decremented by 1.
