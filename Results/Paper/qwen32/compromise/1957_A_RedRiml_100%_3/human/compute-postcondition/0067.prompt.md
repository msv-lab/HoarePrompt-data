Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w - 1`, where `w` is greater than 1; `ln` is the new input integer; `palka` is a new list of integers from the input; `d` is an empty dictionary; `pl` is an empty list; `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w - 1`, where `w` is greater than 1; `ln` is the new input integer; `palka` is a new list of integers from the input and must have at least 1 element; `pl` is a list that may or may not contain the value `i` (if `i` was not in `pl` before, it is now added); `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`. If `d.get(i)` was `None`, then `d` is updated to contain the key `i` with the value `1`. Otherwise, if `d.get(i)` is not `None`, the value of `d[i]` is incremented by `1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w - 1`, where `w` is greater than 1; `ln` is the new input integer; `palka` is a new list of integers from the input and must have at least 1 element; `pl` is a list that may or may not contain the value `i`, but if `i` was not in `pl` before, it is now added; `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3` (recalculated considering the new value of `d[i]`); if `d.get(i)` was `None`, `d[i]` is set to `1`; otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by `1`; `i` is the next element in `palka`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w - 1`, where `w` is greater than 1; `ln` is the new input integer; `palka` is a new list of integers from the input and must have at least 1 element; `pl` is a list that contains the value `i` (if it was not already present); `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3` (recalculated considering the new value of `d[i]`); `d[i]` is set to 1 if it was `None` before, otherwise it is incremented by 1; `i` is the next element in `palka`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
