The given code snippet increments the value of `d[i]` by 1. Here's the impact on the variables:

- `d[i]` is incremented by 1. If `d[i]` was `None`, it would have been set to 1 in a previous step, so this increment would make it 2. If `d[i]` already had a value, it would simply be increased by 1.
- Other variables (`t`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, `shapes`, `w`, `i`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.

The output state, therefore, is:

Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w - 1`, where `w` is greater than 1; `ln` is the new input integer; `palka` is a new list of integers from the input and must have at least 1 element; `pl` is a list that may or may not contain the value `i` (if `i` was not in `pl` before, it is now added); `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`; `d[i]` is incremented by 1; `i` is the next element in `palka`.**
