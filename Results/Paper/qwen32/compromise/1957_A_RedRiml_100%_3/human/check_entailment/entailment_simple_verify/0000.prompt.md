You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        shapes = 0
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        print(shapes)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        pl = []
        
        d = {}
        
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        
        shapes = 0
        
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        
        print(shapes)
        
    #State: `t` remains the initial value of `w`; `w` is unchanged; `ln`, `palka`, `d`, and `pl` hold the values from the last test case; `shapes` holds the number of shapes that can be formed in the last test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly account for the requirement that the polygons must be regular (equal-sided) and that the number of sides must be at least 3. The program currently counts the number of sticks of each length and then divides by 3 to determine the number of polygons that can be formed, which is incorrect. This approach does not consider the minimum number of sides required for a polygon (which is 3) and it does not ensure that the polygons are regular by using the same number of sticks of the same length for each polygon.

For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
6
2 2 2 2 2 2
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Explanation:
- We can form two equilateral triangles (polygons with 3 equal sides) using the 6 sticks of length 2.

However, the provided program will output `2` because it divides the count of sticks of length 2 by 3. This is correct for this specific case, but it is not a general solution. The program does not handle cases where the number of sticks of a particular length is not a multiple of 3, or where the number of sticks is sufficient to form polygons with more than 3 sides.

Another problematic case is when the number of sticks is not enough to form any polygon at all:

Input:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
0
```

Explanation:
- We cannot form any polygon because we do not have enough sticks of the same length to form a polygon with at least 3 sides.

The provided program will output `0` for this case, which is correct, but it does not correctly handle all cases where the number of sticks is not a multiple of 3 or where the number of sticks is sufficient to form polygons with more than 3 sides.

To fix the program, it should consider the minimum number of sides required for a polygon (which is 3) and ensure that the number of sticks of each length is sufficient to form regular polygons with at least 3 sides. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) is None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
        shapes = 0
        for j in d:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                # Find the maximum number of polygons that can be formed with d[j] sticks of length j
                # Each polygon needs at least 3 sticks
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        print(shapes)

# This version of the program is more correct, but the original program is still incorrect because it does not handle all cases properly.
```

The original program does not handle the general case of forming polygons with more than 3 sides and does not correctly account for the requirement that polygons must be regular. Therefore, the correctness of the original program is False.
