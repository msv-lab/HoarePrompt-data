You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if infoA.balance != infoB.balance:
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
    return infoB.position - infoA.position

#Function 2:
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join((info.character for info in balance_info))
    print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
class BalanceInfo:

    def __init__(self, balance, position, character):
        self.balance = balance
        self.position = position
        self.character = character
if __name__ == '__main__':
    s = input().strip()
    func_2(s)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes 'balance' and 'position', where 'balance' is an integer representing the balance of a prefix of a parentheses sequence, and 'position' is an integer representing the position of a character in the input sequence.
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between the balance of infoA and the balance of infoB.
    #State: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes 'balance' and 'position', where 'balance' is an integer representing the balance of a prefix of a parentheses sequence, and 'position' is an integer representing the position of a character in the input sequence. Additionally, the balance of infoA is equal to the balance of infoB.
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two objects, `infoA` and `infoB`, each with attributes `balance` and `position`. It returns the difference between the `balance` of `infoA` and `infoB` if their balances are not equal. If their balances are equal, it returns the difference between the `position` of `infoB` and `infoA`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", and the string represents a balanced parentheses sequence.
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", and the string represents a balanced parentheses sequence; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` is a list of `BalanceInfo` objects where each object contains the balance at each index `i` of `s` and the character at that index; `balance` is 0.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: result (where result is the string formed by joining the `character` attributes of `balance_info` objects in the specified order)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", representing a balanced parentheses sequence. It prints a string formed by rearranging the characters of `s` based on the balance and position of each parenthesis, sorted first by balance and then by the negative position. The function does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's break down the problem and the solution step-by-step.

### Problem Breakdown:

1. **Balanced Parentheses Sequence**: A sequence where the number of opening and closing parentheses are equal, and at no point in the sequence, when read from left to right, does the number of closing parentheses exceed the number of opening ones.

2. **Prefix Balance**: For a given position in the sequence, the prefix balance is the number of opening parentheses minus the number of closing parentheses up to that point.

3. **Balanced Shuffle Operation**: This operation involves:
   - Calculating the prefix balance for each position in the sequence.
   - Sorting the characters based on their prefix balance in ascending order. If two characters have the same prefix balance, they are sorted by their position in descending order.
   - Forming a new sequence from the sorted characters.

### Program Explanation:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is intended to be used as a comparator for sorting. However, in the provided code, `func_1` is not used. Instead, a lambda function is used for sorting.
   
2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store information about each character in the sequence.
   - **Balance Calculation**: It iterates through the string `s`, appending a `BalanceInfo` object to `balance_info` for each character, along with the current prefix balance.
   - **Sorting**: It sorts the `balance_info` list based on the prefix balance in ascending order. If two characters have the same prefix balance, they are sorted by their position in descending order.
   - **Result Construction**: It constructs the final result by joining the characters in the sorted order.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Undefined `BalanceInfo` Class**: The code uses a `BalanceInfo` class, but it is not defined anywhere in the provided code. This class should be defined to store the balance, position, and character for each element in the sequence.

2. **Comparator Function `func_1`**: Although a comparator function `func_1` is defined, it is not used in the sorting process. Instead, a lambda function is used. While the lambda function correctly implements the sorting criteria, the presence of `func_1` can be confusing if it's intended to be used.

### Correctness:

Despite the issues mentioned, the logic for calculating the prefix balance, sorting the characters, and constructing the result is correct. If the `BalanceInfo` class is properly defined, the program should work as intended.

### Conclusion:

Given that the provided code logically implements the balanced shuffle operation and the issues mentioned do not affect the correctness of the algorithm, we can conclude that the program is correct based on the logic provided, assuming the `BalanceInfo` class is defined correctly.

Correctness: **True**
