The code snippet creates a new list `l11` that contains all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, and `l2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the same as at the end of the previous iteration; `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the new input; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input; `a2` is the first integer from the latest input; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`.**
