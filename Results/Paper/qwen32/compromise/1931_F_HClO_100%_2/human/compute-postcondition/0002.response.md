The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer input provided such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1. This value of `t` is not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input provided such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.**
