Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, and `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language Explanation: The values of the variables do not change, but we exit the most internal loop or if statement. The conditions that `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, and `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1` remain valid.
