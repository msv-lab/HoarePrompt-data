The code assigns the value `1` to the variable `p1`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `idx1` remain unchanged. The condition `if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is not evaluated because `p2` is not defined in the given initial state or code snippet. Therefore, no changes occur to the loop or if statement based on the provided code.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `idx1` is 2, `p1` is 1.**
