Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `idx1` is 1, `idx2` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of `n`, `i`, `idx1`, and `idx2` remain unchanged. The code executes a `break` statement, which causes us to exit the most internal loop or if statement.
