The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and assigns the first integer to `a2` and the rest to `l2`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the same as at the end of the previous iteration; `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the new input; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input; `a2` is the first integer from the latest input; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input.**
