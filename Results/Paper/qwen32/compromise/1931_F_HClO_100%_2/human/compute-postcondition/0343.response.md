Postcondition: **`idx1` and `idx2` will be set to the index where the first mismatch occurs with the specified conditions, or the loop will break when `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`. If `idx2` is `-1` and `idx1` is not `-1`, then `idx1` is not `-1`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p1` remains unchanged, `p2` remains unchanged, and `val` remains an empty list. Otherwise, the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain as per the conditions leading up to the if statement, and `val` remains an empty list. Additionally, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`.**
