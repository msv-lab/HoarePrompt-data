Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `idx1` is 2, `idx2` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without changing the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `idx1`, or `idx2`.
