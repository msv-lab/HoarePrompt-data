The code `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the element `a1` at the position `idx2` in the list `l1`. This operation shifts all elements to the right of `idx2` one position to the right.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n-2`
- `idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`
- `idx2` is not `-1`
- `p1` is `0` or `1`
- `p2` is `0` or `1`
- `val` is an empty list
- `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`
- If `idx2` was `-1` and `idx1` was not `-1`, then `idx2` is updated to `n-2`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `idx2`.
- The current value of `idx1` is greater than `idx2`.

After executing `l1.insert(idx2, a1)`, the list `l1` will have `a1` inserted at the position `idx2`. The length of `l1` increases by 1, and the elements from `idx2` onwards are shifted to the right.

Since `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, the value of `idx1` remains unchanged relative to its position in `l1` after the insertion. However, `idx1` now points to the element that was originally at `idx1` before the insertion, which is now at `idx1 + 1`.

The values of `i`, `p1`, `p2`, and `val` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `idx1` is either `n-1` or `-1`, `idx2` is not `-1`, `p1` is `0` or `1`, `p2` is `0` or `1`, `val` is an empty list, `l1` has `a1` inserted at position `idx2`. If `idx1` was `n-2`, it is now `n-1`. If `idx1` was `-1`, it remains `-1`.**
