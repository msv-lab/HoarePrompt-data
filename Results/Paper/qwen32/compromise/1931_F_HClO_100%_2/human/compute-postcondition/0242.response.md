To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables over time. The loop runs `m - 2` times, and during each iteration, it appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`, where `a3` is the first integer from the input and `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the input.

Given the initial state and the states after the first three iterations, we can infer the following:

1. The loop variable `i` remains `n-2` throughout the loop.
2. The variable `idx1` remains either `n-2` or `-1`.
3. The variable `idx2` remains not `-1`.
4. The variables `p1` and `p2` remain `0` or `1`.
5. The variable `m` is at least 3 (since the loop runs at least once).
6. The variable `val` accumulates tuples `(a3, l3)` with each iteration.

After `m - 2` iterations, `val` will contain `m - 2` tuples, each representing the first integer and the rest of the integers from the input for that iteration.

### Final Output State:
- `i` remains `n-2`.
- `idx1` remains either `n-2` or `-1`.
- `idx2` remains not `-1`.
- `p1` remains `0` or `1`.
- `p2` remains `0` or `1`.
- `val` contains `m - 2` tuples, each tuple being `(a3, l3)` from the respective iterations.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`, `idx2` is not `-1`, `p1` is `0` or `1`, `p2` is `0` or `1`, `val` includes `m - 2` tuples `(a3, l3)` from the input.**

In simpler terms, the loop continues to append tuples of the form `(first_integer, list_of_remaining_integers)` to `val` until it has done so `m - 2` times. All other variables retain their initial values unless explicitly modified within the loop, which they are not.
