To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop operates and how it modifies the state based on the given conditions.

The loop iterates `m - 2` times, and during each iteration, it reads a line of input consisting of an integer `a3` followed by a list of integers `l3`. It appends the tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`.

Given the output states after the first three iterations:
- After the first iteration, `val` contains one tuple.
- After the second iteration, `val` contains two tuples.
- After the third iteration, `val` contains three tuples.

Following this pattern, after `m - 2` iterations, `val` will contain `m - 2` tuples.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations of the loop is:

Output State: **`val` contains `m - 2` tuples of the form `(a3, l3)` where each `a3` is the first integer from each input line and `l3` is the list of remaining integers from each input line.**

In simpler terms, `val` will have accumulated `m - 2` pairs of an integer and a list of integers, each pair corresponding to the input read in each iteration of the loop.
