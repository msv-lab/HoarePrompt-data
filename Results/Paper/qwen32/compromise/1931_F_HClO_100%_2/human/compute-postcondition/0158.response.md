The code assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`. Given that `i` is 0, both `idx1` and `idx2` will now hold the value 0. The other variables (`n`, `l1[i + p1]`, `l2[i + p2]`, `a2`, `a1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0**.
