You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
import random

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, either "Yes" followed by a shuffled version of the input string s (if s was not equal to the shuffled string s2) or "No" (if s was equal to the shuffled string s2) is printed. The values of s and s2 are not preserved after the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to rearrange the characters of a given string `s` to form a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`. If no such rearrangement is possible, we should output "NO". Otherwise, we output "YES" followed by one possible rearrangement.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case:
1. It reads a string `s`.
2. It generates a random permutation of the string `s` using `random.sample(s, len(s))`.
3. It checks if the generated permutation `s2` is different from the original string `s`.
4. If `s2` is different from `s`, it prints "YES" and the permutation `s2`.
5. If `s2` is the same as `s`, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Analysis:
The program's logic is flawed because it relies on random sampling to find a different permutation. There are several issues:
1. **Randomness**: The program uses randomness to find a different permutation, which means there is a possibility (albeit small) that it will not find a different permutation in a reasonable number of attempts, especially for strings with repeated characters (like "aaaaa").
2. **No Guarantee**: The program does not guarantee that it will find a different permutation if one exists. It may repeatedly generate the same permutation, leading to an incorrect "NO" output.
3. **Inefficiency**: The program does not handle the case where a different permutation is guaranteed to exist (e.g., for strings with at least two distinct characters) efficiently.

### Example:
For the input "aaaaa", the program will almost always output "NO" because the only permutation of "aaaaa" is "aaaaa" itself. This is incorrect because the problem statement specifies that if no such string `r` exists, we should output "NO", but the program incorrectly assumes that it can always find a different permutation through random sampling.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not guarantee that it will find a different permutation if one exists and may incorrectly output "NO" for strings that have possible rearrangements.

Correctness: **False**
