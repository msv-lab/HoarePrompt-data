You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that the Manhattan value of the permutation is equal to \( k \). The Manhattan value is defined as:
\[ \text{Manhattan value} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |p_i - i| \]

### Program Analysis:

1. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads a test case (pair of \( n \) and \( k \)).
   - It checks if \( k \) is odd. If it is, it returns (0, 0) indicating no solution is possible because the Manhattan value of any permutation is always even.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length \( n \).
     - For odd \( n \), the maximum Manhattan value is \( \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \).
     - For even \( n \), the maximum Manhattan value is \( \frac{n^2}{2} \).
   - If \( k \) is greater than this maximum value, it returns (0, 0) indicating no solution is possible.
   - Otherwise, it returns \( n \) and \( k \).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function generates a permutation of length \( n \) with a Manhattan value of \( k \).
   - It divides \( k \) by 2 because the Manhattan value of a permutation is always even.
   - It initializes the permutation as the identity permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - It then iterates backwards through the permutation, adjusting elements to increase the Manhattan value.
   - The logic for adjusting elements is complex and involves moving elements to specific positions in the list to achieve the desired Manhattan value.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function prints "YES" followed by the permutation if a valid permutation is found.

4. **Function `func_4`:**
   - This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_2` to get \( n \) and \( k \).
   - If \( n \) is 0 (indicating no solution is possible), it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and `func_3` to print it.

### Correctness Assessment:
- The program correctly checks for the feasibility of the problem by ensuring \( k \) is even and not exceeding the maximum possible Manhattan value.
- The logic for generating the permutation in `func_1` is complex and not immediately obvious, but it is designed to achieve the desired Manhattan value by iteratively adjusting the permutation.
- The program handles multiple test cases and outputs "YES" or "NO" as required.

Given the above analysis, the program seems to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. However, the complexity and correctness of `func_1` are not trivial to verify without a detailed proof of its correctness.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program appears to be correct for the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
