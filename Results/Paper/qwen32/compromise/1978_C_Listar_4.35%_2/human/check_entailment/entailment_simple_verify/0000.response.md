Let's carefully analyze the provided code and annotations to determine if the program correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to determine if a permutation of length `n` can have a specific Manhattan value `k`. The Manhattan value of a permutation `p` is defined as:
\[ \text{Manhattan value} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |p_i - i| \]

### Code Analysis

#### Function `func_2`
- **Purpose**: Validate if a permutation of length `n` can have a Manhattan value `k`.
- **Logic**:
  - If `k` is odd, return `(0, 0)` because the Manhattan value is always even.
  - Calculate `max_k` based on whether `n` is odd or even.
    - For odd `n`, `max_k` is calculated as \((n^2 - 1) / 2\).
    - For even `n`, `max_k` is calculated as \(n^2 / 2\).
  - If `k` exceeds `max_k`, return `(0, 0)`.
  - Otherwise, return `(n, k)`.

**Issue**:
- The calculation of `max_k` is incorrect. The maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is \(n \times (n - 1) / 2\). This is because the maximum deviation for each element is \(n - 1\), and there are `n` elements, but the sum of deviations is halved due to the absolute value symmetry.

#### Function `func_1`
- **Purpose**: Construct a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value `k`.
- **Logic**:
  - Divide `k` by 2.
  - Initialize `l` as a list of integers from 1 to `n`.
  - Iterate from `n-1` to 0, adjusting the list `l` based on the value of `k`.
  - If `k` becomes 0, return the list.
  - If `1 + i` is greater than `k`, move the last element to the position `-k` and return the list.
  - Otherwise, update `k` and move the last element to the front.

**Issue**:
- The logic for constructing the permutation is flawed and does not guarantee that the resulting permutation will have the exact Manhattan value `k`.

#### Function `func_3`
- **Purpose**: Print the permutation if it exists.
- **Logic**: Print "YES" followed by the permutation.

#### Function `func_4`
- **Purpose**: Main function to handle each test case.
- **Logic**:
  - Call `func_2` to validate the permutation.
  - If `n` is 0, print "NO".
  - Otherwise, call `func_1` to construct the permutation and `func_3` to print it.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified in `func_2` (incorrect calculation of `max_k`) and `func_1` (flawed logic for constructing the permutation), the program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases.

**Final Evaluation**: The program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
