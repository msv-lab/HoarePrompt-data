Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as specified in the problem description. Let's analyze why:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`) based on whether `n` is odd or even.
   - For odd `n`, `max_k` is calculated as `(n ** 2 - 1) // 2`.
   - For even `n`, `max_k` is calculated as `n ** 2 // 2`.
   - However, the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is actually `n * (n - 1) // 2`. This is because the maximum deviation for each element is `n - 1`, and there are `n` elements, but the sum of deviations is halved due to the absolute value symmetry.
   - The current calculation for `max_k` is incorrect and can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function attempts to construct a permutation with a given Manhattan value `k`.
   - The logic for constructing the permutation is not correct and does not guarantee that the resulting permutation will have the exact Manhattan value `k`.
   - The loop and the way elements are moved in the list do not ensure that the correct number of inversions (which contribute to the Manhattan value) are introduced.

3. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function orchestrates the input reading, calls `func_2` to check if the permutation is possible, and then calls `func_1` to construct the permutation.
   - Since `func_2` and `func_1` have issues, `func_4` will not produce correct results for all cases.

To illustrate, consider the test case `n = 3` and `k = 4`:
- The correct output should be `Yes` followed by a permutation like `3 1 2` with a Manhattan value of 4.
- However, the current implementation will not correctly handle this case due to the incorrect calculation of `max_k` and the flawed logic in `func_1`.

Thus, the program is incorrect for at least one potential case, and the correct response is `False`.
