Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

    5 12

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

    #State: the list `l` is modified based on the value of `k` and the loop conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k` as inputs. It returns a list of integers from 1 to `n` that has been modified based on the value of `k`. The modifications involve rearranging the elements of the list according to specific conditions derived from the value of `k`. If `k` is 0, the function returns the list in its original order. Otherwise, elements are moved within the list following a specific pattern until `k` is reduced to 0 or all possible rearrangements are performed.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and k is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12).
def func_2():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (k % 2) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns 0, 0
    #State: `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the two integers read from the input, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5) and `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12). Additionally, `k` is even.
    if (n % 2) :
        max_k = (n ** 2 - 1) // 2
    else :
        max_k = n ** 2 // 2
    #State: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and `k` is a non-negative even integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12). If `n` is odd, `max_k` is set to `(n - 1) / 2`. If `n` is even, `max_k` is set to `n`.
    if (max_k < k) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns 0, 0
    #State: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and `k` is a non-negative even integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12). If `n` is odd, `max_k` is set to `(n - 1) / 2`. If `n` is even, `max_k` is set to `n`. Additionally, `k` is less than or equal to `max_k`.
    return n, k
    #The program returns `n`, which is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and `k`, which is a non-negative even integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) and less than or equal to `max_k`. If `n` is odd, `max_k` is set to `(n - 1) / 2`. If `n` is even, `max_k` is set to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input. It returns `(0, 0)` if `k` is odd or if `k` is greater than a calculated maximum value `max_k`. Otherwise, it returns the original values of `n` and `k`. The maximum value `max_k` is `(n - 1) // 2` if `n` is odd, and `n // 2` if `n` is even.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, where each integer is distinct and ranges from 1 to n.
def func_3(l):
    print('YES')
    #This is printed: YES
    for i in l:
        print(i, end=' ')
        
    #State: The integers in the list l are printed in the order they appear, separated by spaces.
    print()
    #This is printed: (an empty line)
    return
    #The program returns None.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a list `l` of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, where each integer is distinct and ranges from 1 to `n`. It prints the integers in the list in the order they appear, separated by spaces, followed by an empty line. The function does not return any value (returns `None`).

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12.
def func_4():
    n, k = func_2()
    if (n == 0) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program does not return any value.
    #State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12, and `n` is not equal to 0
    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_3(l)
    return
    #The program returns nothing (None)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` takes no direct input parameters but implicitly receives values `n` and `k` from `func_2`. It checks if `n` is zero, in which case it prints 'NO' and terminates without returning any value. If `n` is not zero, it calls `func_1` with `n` and `k`, then passes the result to `func_3`. The function does not return any value.
