To determine the output state, we need to understand the behavior of the function `func_1(n, k)`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code snippet, we can only infer the output state based on the given initial state and the fact that `l` is assigned the result of `func_1(n, k)`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12.
- `n` is not equal to 0 (though this is redundant since `n` is positive).

The output state will include the new variable `l` which holds the result of `func_1(n, k)`. Since `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the specific value of `l`. However, we can describe the output state as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12, `l` is the result of `func_1(n, k)`**.
