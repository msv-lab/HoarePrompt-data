The given code snippet calls a function `func_3` with the argument `l`, which is the result of another function call `func_1(n, k)`. Since the definitions of `func_1` and `func_3` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value or changes to any variables inside these functions. However, we can state that `func_3(l)` has been executed with `l` as its input.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the only variable that is directly impacted is `l` by the call to `func_3(l)`. Since we do not have the definition of `func_3`, we cannot determine if `l` is modified or if any other side effects occur.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12, `l` is the result of `func_1(n, k)`, and `func_3(l)` has been executed.**
