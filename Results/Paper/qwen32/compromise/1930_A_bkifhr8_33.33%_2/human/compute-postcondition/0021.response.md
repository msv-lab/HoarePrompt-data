Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 1, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is an empty list, `l` is a string representing the line of input from the user, `lst` is a list of 2n strings, each representing one of the integers from `l`, and `ans` is updated to `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `ans_f`, `l`, and `lst` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is updated to be the sum of its previous value and the minimum of the first two integers in the list `lst`. The program execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
