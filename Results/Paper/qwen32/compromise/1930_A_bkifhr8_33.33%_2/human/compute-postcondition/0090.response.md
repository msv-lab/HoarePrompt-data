To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000.
   - `i` is initialized to `n * 2`.
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50.
   - `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7.
   - `ans_f` is a list containing the elements [0, `ans`], where `ans` is initially 0.
   - `l` is a string input by the user.
   - `lst` is the list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces.

2. **Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop runs for `n * 2` iterations.
   - In each iteration, if the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, the first and third elements of `lst` are removed, and `ans` is incremented by the minimum of the first two elements of the modified `lst` converted to integers.
   - If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is incremented by the minimum of the two integers in `lst`, and the loop breaks.

3. **Final State**:
   - The loop will execute `n * 2` times unless it breaks prematurely when `lst` is reduced to two elements.
   - After each iteration, `ans` is updated by adding the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`.
   - `lst` will be reduced to two elements or fewer after `n * 2` iterations, at which point `ans` will have accumulated the sum of the minimums of the pairs of elements as the loop progresses.
   - `ans_f` will be updated to [0, `ans`].

Given the loop runs `n * 2` times, the final state of the variables will be:

- `t` remains unchanged.
- `i` will be `n * 2 - 1` after the loop completes (since the loop runs from 0 to `n * 2 - 1`).
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `ans_f` will be [0, `ans`], where `ans` is the sum of the minimums of the pairs of integers in `lst`.
- `l` remains unchanged.
- `lst` will be empty or contain two elements, depending on whether the loop broke early.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is `n * 2 - 1`, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is a list containing the elements [0, `ans`], where `ans` is the sum of the minimums of the pairs of integers in `lst`, `l` is a string input by the user, `lst` is either empty or contains two elements.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the loop will have summed up the minimum values of pairs of integers from the list `lst` and stored this sum in `ans_f[1]`. The loop index `i` will be one less than the total number of iterations (`n * 2 - 1`), and the list `lst` will either be empty or have two elements left.
