The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, inclusive. After executing this line, the value of `t` will be updated to the integer provided by the user input. The other variables `n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` remain unchanged because they are not referenced or modified in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input by the user (1 <= `t` <= 5000); `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7.**
