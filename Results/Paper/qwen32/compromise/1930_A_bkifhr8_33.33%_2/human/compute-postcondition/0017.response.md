The code snippet adds the minimum of the integer values of the first two elements of the list `lst` to the variable `ans`. Therefore, `ans` will be updated based on the values of `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 1, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is an empty list, `l` is a string representing the line of input from the user, `lst` is a list of 2n strings, each representing one of the integers from `l`, and `ans` is the sum of its previous value and the minimum of the integer values of the first two elements of `lst`.**
