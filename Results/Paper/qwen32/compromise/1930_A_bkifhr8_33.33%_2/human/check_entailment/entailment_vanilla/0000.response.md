Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to maximize the score by performing `n` moves, where each move consists of selecting two integers from the list, adding the smaller of the two to the score, and removing both integers from the list. The goal is to find the optimal strategy to achieve the maximum score after `n` moves.

### Optimal Strategy
The optimal strategy is to always pair the smallest numbers together. This is because pairing the smallest numbers ensures that we add the smallest possible values to the score in each move, which maximizes the final score.

### Program Analysis
Let's walk through the given program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and then reads `2n` integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it initializes the score `ans` to 0.
   - It reads the list of integers as a string and splits it into a list of strings `lst`.
   - It then enters a loop to perform `n` moves.

3. **Performing Moves:**
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the length of `lst` is not equal to 2. However, this condition is incorrect and unnecessary.
   - It attempts to add the minimum of the first two elements to the score and then tries to remove elements from the list. The removal logic is incorrect and will cause an `IndexError` because `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` are incorrect indices.

4. **Handling the Last Pair:**
   - If the length of `lst` is 2, it adds the minimum of the two remaining elements to the score and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the scores for each test case.

### Issues in the Program
- The program does not sort the list of integers before processing, which is crucial for the optimal strategy.
- The removal logic inside the loop is incorrect and will cause errors.
- The loop condition and the handling of the last pair are not correctly implemented.

### Correct Implementation
To correctly implement the solution, the program should:
- Sort the list of integers.
- Pair the smallest numbers together and add the smaller number in each pair to the score.

### Correctness
Given the issues in the provided program, it is not correct. The program does not follow the optimal strategy and contains logical errors.

Correctness: **False**
