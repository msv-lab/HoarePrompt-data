Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. If the string `s` contains more than one unique character, it prints 'YES' and then prints a modified version of the string based on whether it is a palindrome or not. If the string `s` contains only one unique character, it prints 'NO'.**
