Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `s` is a non-empty string; `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the string `s`; `i` is the last character in the string `s`. If the length of `a` is greater than 1, `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half of `s`. If `newstr` is equal to `s`, then `s` is a palindrome, and `isreverse` is equal to `s`; otherwise, `isreverse` is not equal to `s`. If the length of `a` is 1, then the length of the set `a` is 1.**
