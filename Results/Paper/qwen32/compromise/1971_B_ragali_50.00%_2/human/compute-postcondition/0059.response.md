The code snippet `a.add(i)` adds the current character `i` to the set `a`. Since `a` is a set, it will now include the previous value of `i` and the new value of `i`. The values of `t` and `s` remain unchanged. The variable `i` still represents the next character in the string `s` after its previous value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `s` is a non-empty string; `a` is a set containing the previous value of `i` and the new value of `i`; `i` is the next character in the string `s` after its previous value.**
