Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `s` is a string that is the input stripped of leading and trailing spaces; `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the string `s`, and the length of the set `a` is greater than 1; `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half of `s`; `isreverse` is the reverse of the string `s`. If `newstr` is not equal to `s`, then `s` is not a palindrome. Otherwise, `s` is a palindrome.**
