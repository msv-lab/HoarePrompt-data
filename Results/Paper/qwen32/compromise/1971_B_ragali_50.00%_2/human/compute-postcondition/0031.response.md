The code snippet adds the value of `i` to the set `a`. Given that `i` is `i + 1` in the initial state, we can assume `i` was incremented by 1 before this line of code executed. Therefore, `a` will now contain the value of `i` after it was incremented.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `s` is a non-empty string; `a` is a set containing the value of `i` after it was incremented; `i` is `i + 1`**. 

In simpler terms, `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` remains a non-empty string, `a` now includes the incremented value of `i`, and `i` has been incremented by 1.
