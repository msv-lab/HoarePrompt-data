You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        a = set()
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. If the string `s` contains more than one unique character, it prints 'YES' and then prints a modified version of the string based on whether it is a palindrome or not. If the string `s` contains only one unique character, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, there are a few issues:

1. **Incorrect Rearrangement Logic**:
   - The program attempts to rearrange the string by taking the second half and appending the first half (`s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]`). This method does not guarantee that the new string will be different from the original string for all cases.
   - For example, if the input string is `"aaabbb"`, the rearrangement logic results in `"bbbaaa"`, which is different from the original string. However, if the input string is `"ababab"`, the rearrangement logic results in `"ababab"`, which is the same as the original string.

2. **Handling of Reverse String**:
   - The program checks if the reverse of the string is different from the original string. However, it does not always provide a valid rearrangement if the initial rearrangement logic fails.
   - For example, if the input string is `"abcabc"`, the rearrangement logic results in `"abcabc"`, and the reverse is also `"cbacba"`, which is different from the original string. However, the program does not handle cases where the initial rearrangement and reverse do not provide a valid solution.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle strings of length 1 or 2 correctly. For example, if the input string is `"a"`, the program will output `"NO"` because it only contains one unique character. However, if the input string is `"ab"`, the program will output `"YES"` and rearrange it to `"ba"`, which is correct.
   - However, the program's logic for rearranging strings of length 2 is not robust. For example, if the input string is `"aa"`, the program will output `"NO"` because it only contains one unique character, which is correct, but for `"ab"`, the program should correctly output `"YES"` and rearrange it to `"ba"`.

To fix these issues, the program should implement a more robust rearrangement logic that ensures the new string is different from the original string for all cases. One possible approach is to swap two different characters in the string if possible. If the string contains only one unique character, the program should output `"NO"`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        a = set()
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = list(s)
            for i in range(len(newstr) - 1):
                if newstr[i] != newstr[i + 1]:
                    newstr[i], newstr[i + 1] = newstr[i + 1], newstr[i]
                    break
            print(''.join(newstr))
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that if the string contains more than one unique character, it swaps two adjacent different characters to create a new string that is different from the original string. If the string contains only one unique character, it outputs `"NO"`.
