Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues with the program:

1. The logic for inserting a new problem with difficulty `w` is incorrect. The program attempts to insert `b[j]` into `a` when `b[j] < a[i]`, but it does not actually propose a new problem with difficulty `w`; instead, it replaces an element in `a` with `b[j]`. The problem requires proposing new problems with arbitrary difficulties `w` to ensure that `a_i <= b_i` for all `i`.

2. The program does not maintain the sorted order of `a` after inserting a new problem difficulty `w`. The problem states that after inserting `w`, the array `a` should be sorted in non-decreasing order, and then the most difficult problem (the last element) should be removed.

3. The function `func_1(arr)` is defined but never used in the program, and it sorts the array in reverse order, which is not needed for the problem.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Iterate through the arrays `a` and `b`.
- For each problem in `a`, check if it meets the expected difficulty in `b`.
- If not, propose a new problem with a difficulty less than or equal to the expected difficulty, insert it into `a`, sort `a`, and remove the most difficult problem.
- Count the number of new problems proposed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if a[i] > b[i]:
            # Propose a new problem with difficulty b[i]
            a.append(b[i])
            a.sort()
            a.pop()  # Remove the most difficult problem
            cnt += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    print(cnt)
```

This corrected version ensures that the new problems are proposed with the correct difficulties and that the array `a` is maintained in non-decreasing order after each insertion and removal.
