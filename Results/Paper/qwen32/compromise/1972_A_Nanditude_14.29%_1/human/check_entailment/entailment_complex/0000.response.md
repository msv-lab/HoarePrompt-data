### Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the two lists `a` and `b` simultaneously. However, the logic in the program is flawed. The program is trying to insert elements from `b` into `a` when `b[j] < a[i]` and then removing the last element from `a`. This approach does not guarantee that the final list `a` will be sorted in non-decreasing order after each insertion and removal, and it does not correctly simulate the process described in the problem.

The correct approach should involve inserting elements from `b` into `a` in a way that maintains the sorted order of `a` and then removing the largest element from `a` if necessary. The provided function `func_1` is not used in the main program and seems to be unrelated to the problem at hand.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    j = 0
    while i < n and j < n:
        if b[j] < a[i]:
            a.pop(-1)
            a.insert(i, b[j])
            cnt += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            i += 1
            j += 1
    print(cnt)
```

In the corrected version, when `b[j] < a[i]`, the program inserts `b[j]` at position `i` in `a` and increments the count `cnt`. After each insertion, the list `a` remains sorted because `b[j]` is inserted at the correct position `i` and the largest element is removed.

### Correctness:
The provided program does not correctly implement the described logic and does not maintain the correct order of elements in `a` after each insertion and removal. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
