Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` â‰¥ 1; `n` is 0; `L` is a list with at least two elements, `a` is the second element of `L`; `pow` is 2; `m` is 1; `tot` is `tot + a`. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains the same as described.**
