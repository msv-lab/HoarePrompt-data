The code snippet provided is `pow *= 2`, which doubles the value of the variable `pow`. The other variables in the initial state are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `pow`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that `t` ≥ 1
- `n` is 0
- `k` is `k - tot`
- `L` is a list with at least one element
- `pow` is 1
- `tot` is increased by `a`
- If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement

After executing `pow *= 2`, the value of `pow` changes from 1 to 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` ≥ 1; `n` is 0; `k` is `k - tot`; `L` is a list with at least one element; `pow` is 2; `tot` is increased by `a`; If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
