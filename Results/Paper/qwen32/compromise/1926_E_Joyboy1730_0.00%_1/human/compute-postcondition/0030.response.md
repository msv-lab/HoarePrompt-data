Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` â‰¥ 1; `n` is 0; `k` is `k - 2 * tot`; `L` is a list with at least one element; `pow` is 4; `tot` is increased by `a` twice; `a` is `a_next`. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

In natural language: The value of `pow` has been doubled from 2 to 4. All other variables retain their previously described states.
