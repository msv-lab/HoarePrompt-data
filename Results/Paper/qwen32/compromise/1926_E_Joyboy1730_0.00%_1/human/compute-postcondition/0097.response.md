Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` â‰¥ 1; `n` is 0; `k` is the value provided by the input; `L` is a list with at least one element, `a` is the first element of `L`; `pow` is 1; `tot` is 0 or a value such that `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`; `m` is 1; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
