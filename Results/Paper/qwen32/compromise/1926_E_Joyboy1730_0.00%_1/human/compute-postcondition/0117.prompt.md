Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the input integer, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    L = []
    while n:
        m = (n + 1) // 2
        n -= m
    tot = 0
    pow = 1
    for a in L:
        if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
            print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
            break
        tot += a
        k -= tot
        pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that `t` ≥ 1; `n` is 0; `k` is the remaining value after all subtractions from the initial `k`; `L` is a list with all elements processed; `pow` is `2^i` where `i` is the number of iterations completed; `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L` up to the point where the loop breaks or finishes.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that `t` ≥ 0 and `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `n` is 0; `k` is `k - tot` (where `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L`); `L` is unchanged; `pow` is `2^len(L)`; `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that `t` ≥ 1; `n` is 0; `k` is `k - tot` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise `k` is the value that breaks the loop; `L` is []; `pow` is `2^len(L)` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise `pow` is the value at the point of breaking; `tot` is the sum of elements processed up to the point of breaking or all elements if the loop completes; `m` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
