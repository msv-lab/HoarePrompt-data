The only object in the loop head is the variable `a` from the list `L`. Therefore, we can only adjust `a` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that `t` ≥ 1.
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is `k - 2 * tot`.
- `L` is a list with at least one element.
- `pow` is 4.
- `tot` is increased by `a` twice.
- `a` is `a_next`.
- If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

At the end of the previous iteration, `a` was set to `a_next`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must be the next element in the list `L`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `a` will be the next element in `L` after `a_next`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` ≥ 1, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - 2 * tot`, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 4, `tot` is increased by `a` twice, `a` is the next element in `L` after `a_next`**
