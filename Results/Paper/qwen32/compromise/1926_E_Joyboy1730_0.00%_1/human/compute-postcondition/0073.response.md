Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` â‰¥ 0 and `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `n` is 0; `k` is `k - 2*tot`; `L` is a list with at least one element; `pow` is 4 times its previous value; `tot` is `tot + a`; `a` is the next element in the list `L` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `pow`, `tot`, and `a` remain as described in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
