The given Python code snippet is `pow *= 2`, which means the variable `pow` is being multiplied by 2.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that `t` ≥ 0 and `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is `k - 3*tot`.
- `L` is a list with at least one element.
- `pow` is 4 times its previous value.
- `tot` is `tot + a`.
- `a` is the next element in the list `L`.
- If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

After executing `pow *= 2`, the value of `pow` is doubled. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` ≥ 0 and `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `n` is 0; `k` is `k - 3*tot`; `L` is a list with at least one element; `pow` is 8 times its previous value; `tot` is `tot + a`; `a` is the next element in the list `L`. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
