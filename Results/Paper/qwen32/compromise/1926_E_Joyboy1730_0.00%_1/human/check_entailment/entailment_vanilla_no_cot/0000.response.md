Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, there are several issues:

1. The list `L` is initialized as an empty list but is never populated. It is supposed to contain the counts of cards that are multiples of odd numbers.
2. The while loop is supposed to calculate these counts, but it does not do so correctly. It simply reduces `n` by half repeatedly, which does not help in determining the counts of cards that are multiples of odd numbers.
3. The loop after the while loop attempts to find the k-th card but does not correctly use the counts in `L` to determine the correct card.
4. The print statement inside the loop incorrectly calculates the k-th card using `pow * (2 * k - 1)`, which does not match the logic described in the problem.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        pow = 1
        while True:
            m = (n + 1) // 2  # Count of odd numbers up to n
            if k <= m:
                print(pow * (2 * k - 1))  # k-th odd number
                break
            k -= m
            n //= 2  # Reduce n to count multiples of the next power of 2
            pow *= 2

func()
```

This corrected version calculates the k-th card by first determining how many odd numbers there are up to `n`, and then recursively reducing `n` and `k` to find the correct card based on the multiples of increasing powers of 2.
