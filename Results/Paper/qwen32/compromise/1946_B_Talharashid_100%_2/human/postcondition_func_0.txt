The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the elements of the list and the integer `k`, using the formula `(2^k * maxi - maxi + sum(a)) % 1000000007`, where `maxi` is the maximum value obtained from a particular computation involving the list elements.
