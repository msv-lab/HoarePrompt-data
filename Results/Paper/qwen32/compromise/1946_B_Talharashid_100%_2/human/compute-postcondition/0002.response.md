The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns this list of integers to the variable `l`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
