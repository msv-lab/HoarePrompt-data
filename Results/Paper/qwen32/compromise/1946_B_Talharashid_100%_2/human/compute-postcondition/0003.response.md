The code snippet initializes a variable `c` with the value `0`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `c` is 0.**
