The only variable in the loop head is `i`, as it is the only variable used in the `range` function. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` for the next iteration. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the integer obtained from the input.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an integer
- `k` is an integer
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `c` is 0 or the sum of the last contiguous non-negative numbers in `l`
- `maxi` is the maximum of its previous value and `c`

We need to increment `i` by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `c` is 0 or the sum of the last contiguous non-negative numbers in `l`; `maxi` is the maximum of its previous value and `c`; `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can only state that it is incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `c` is 0 or the sum of the last contiguous non-negative numbers in `l`; `maxi` is the maximum of its previous value and `c`; `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more precise, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `c` is 0 or the sum of the last contiguous non-negative numbers in `l`; `maxi` is the maximum of its previous value and `c`; `i` is x + 1**.

Since we don't have the specific value of `i`, we can simply say:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `c` is 0 or the sum of the last contiguous non-negative numbers in `l`; `maxi` is the maximum of its previous value and `c`; `i` is incremented by 1**.
