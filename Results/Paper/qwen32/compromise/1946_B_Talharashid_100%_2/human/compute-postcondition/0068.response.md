The code snippet `maxi = max(c, maxi)` compares the current value of `c` with `maxi` and assigns the larger of the two to `maxi`. Given the initial state, `maxi` is initially 0, and `c` is equal to `ele`. Therefore, after this operation, `maxi` will be the larger value between `0` and `ele`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `c` is equal to `ele`, `maxi` is the larger value between 0 and `ele`, `i` is `len(l)`. Either `ele` is not less than 0, or `c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele`.**
