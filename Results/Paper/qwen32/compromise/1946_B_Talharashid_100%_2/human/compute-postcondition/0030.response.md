The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the list `l` with new integers obtained from the input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, `maxi`, `i`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer obtained from the input; `k` is the second integer obtained from the input; `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `c` is 0 or the sum of the last contiguous non-negative numbers in the previous `l`; `maxi` is the maximum of its previous value and `c`; `i` is incremented by 1.**
