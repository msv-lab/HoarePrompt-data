Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ele` is the next element in `l`. If `ele` < 0 and `c` <= abs(`ele`), then `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`, and `c` is set to 0. Otherwise, `c` is updated to the previous value of `c` plus `ele`, and `maxi` is updated to the maximum of the previous value of `maxi` and `c`.**
