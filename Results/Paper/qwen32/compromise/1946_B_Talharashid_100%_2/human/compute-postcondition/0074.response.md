The code snippet updates the variable `maxi` to be the maximum value between `c` and the current value of `maxi`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`, `c` is increased by `ele`, `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.**
