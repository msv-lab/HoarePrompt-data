The code snippet `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `c`. This means that if `c` is greater than `maxi`, `maxi` will take the value of `c`. Otherwise, `maxi` remains unchanged.

The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `c` are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an integer
- `k` is an integer
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `c` is 0 or the sum of the last contiguous non-negative numbers in `l`
- `maxi` is the maximum cumulative sum of any contiguous subsequence in `l`

After the execution of the code, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `c` is 0 or the sum of the last contiguous non-negative numbers in `l`; `maxi` is the maximum of its previous value and `c`.**
