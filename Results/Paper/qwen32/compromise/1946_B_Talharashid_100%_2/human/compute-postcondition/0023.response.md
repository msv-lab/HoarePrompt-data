The given code snippet updates the variable `maxi` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `c`. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `ele` remain unchanged, and `c` retains its value as it is not reassigned in the snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements; `ele` is the next element in the list `l`; `c` is the previous value of `c` plus `ele`; `maxi` is the maximum of its previous value and `c`.**
