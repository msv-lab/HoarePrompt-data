To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the variables `c` and `maxi` as the loop processes each element in the list `l`.

Here's a breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `c` is initialized to 0. This variable keeps a running sum of the elements in the list `l` until a negative element is encountered that is greater than or equal to the current sum.
   - `maxi` is initialized to 0. This variable keeps track of the maximum sum encountered during the iteration.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each element `ele` in the list `l`:
     - If `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, `c` is reset to 0, and `maxi` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `c`.
     - Otherwise, `c` is incremented by `ele`, and `maxi` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `c`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `c` will be the sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative numbers before the last negative number that was large enough to reset `c` to 0.
   - `maxi` will be the maximum sum encountered during the entire process.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the final output state will be:

- `t` remains unchanged as it is the number of test cases and not affected by the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is the first integer from the input and not affected by the loop.
- `k` remains unchanged as it is the second integer from the input and not affected by the loop.
- `l` remains unchanged as it is the list of integers from the input and not affected by the loop.
- `i` remains unchanged as it is the length of the list `l` and not affected by the loop.
- `c` will be the sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative numbers before the last negative number that was large enough to reset `c` to 0.
- `maxi` will be the maximum sum encountered during the entire process.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `len(l)`, `c` is the sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative numbers before the last negative number that was large enough to reset `c` to 0, and `maxi` is the maximum sum encountered during the entire process.**

In natural language, the final state means that `t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `i` remain the same as the initial state, `c` holds the sum of the last contiguous non-negative subarray before the last resetting negative number, and `maxi` holds the maximum sum encountered throughout the iteration of the list `l`.
