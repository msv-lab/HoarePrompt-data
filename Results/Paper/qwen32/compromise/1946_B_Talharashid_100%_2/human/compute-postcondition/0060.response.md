The code snippet `c = 0` sets the variable `c` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `maxi`, or `i`. The variable `c` is reset to 0, but `maxi` retains its previous value, which is the maximum of the old value of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum of the previous value of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`, `i` is `len(l)`**.
