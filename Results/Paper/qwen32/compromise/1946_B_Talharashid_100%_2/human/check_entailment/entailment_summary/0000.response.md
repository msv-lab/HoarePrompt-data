### Reasoning:
The provided program aims to solve the problem by calculating the maximum possible sum of the array after performing `k` operations. The operation involves inserting the sum of any contiguous subarray into the array. The program uses a specific formula to compute the result: `(2^k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`, where `maxi` is supposed to be the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray.

However, there are several issues with the provided program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `maxi`:** The program calculates `maxi` by iterating through the array and keeping a running sum of positive elements (`c`). If a negative element is encountered, it resets `c` if it is less than the absolute value of the negative element. This approach does not correctly compute the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray. Instead, the correct way to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray is by using Kadane's algorithm.

2. **Incorrect Formula Usage:** The formula `(2^k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` is not derived from the problem description. It seems like an incorrect interpretation of how the operations should affect the maximum possible sum of the array. The maximum possible sum would be achieved by repeatedly adding the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray to the array, which should be computed using Kadane's algorithm.

3. **Handling Large Numbers:** The program calculates `2^k` directly, which can lead to very large numbers. In Python, this is not an issue due to its arbitrary-precision integers, but the modulo operation should be applied during the exponentiation to avoid overflow and ensure efficiency.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the program's logic and formula, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
