Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations. Let's analyze why the code is incorrect.

The problem requires us to perform exactly k operations where each operation involves selecting any contiguous subarray of the array and inserting the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after k operations.

The provided code attempts to find the maximum subarray sum (using a variation of Kadane's algorithm) and then uses a formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` to compute the final result. However, this formula does not correctly account for the operations described in the problem.

Here are a few issues with the code:
1. **Incorrect Formula**: The formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` does not accurately represent the operations described. The idea of using `2 ** k` suggests an exponential growth, but the problem does not imply such a growth. Instead, it requires us to strategically add sums of subarrays to maximize the total sum.
2. **Handling Negative Values**: The code tries to handle negative values by resetting the count `c` when it encounters a negative number that exceeds the current count. This logic does not align with the problem's requirements.
3. **Lack of Strategic Insertion**: The code does not simulate the actual insertion of subarray sums into the array, which is necessary to maximize the sum after k operations.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the sum of the entire array.
2. Identify the maximum subarray sum.
3. Use the maximum subarray sum to strategically add sums of subarrays to maximize the total sum after k operations.

Here is a corrected approach:
- Calculate the total sum of the array.
- Use Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum.
- If the maximum subarray sum is positive, we can add it to the array k times to maximize the sum. If it is negative or zero, adding it will not help, and we should just return the total sum of the array.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        total_sum = sum(l)
        max_subarray_sum = float('-inf')
        current_sum = 0
        
        # Finding the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm
        for num in l:
            current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)
            max_subarray_sum = max(max_subarray_sum, current_sum)
        
        if max_subarray_sum > 0:
            result = (total_sum + max_subarray_sum * k) % MOD
        else:
            result = total_sum % MOD
        
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected program should handle all the edge cases and provide the correct output for the given problem description.
