Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `T` is `T - 1`, `t` is 0 or 1 if the loop terminates due to `mi * 2 > k`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `a[l]` and `a[r]` decreased by `mi`, `r` is `r - 1`, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, `k` is `k - mi * 2`. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is 1 and `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `l` remains 0; `ans` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms: The value of `r` is decremented by 1. All other conditions and variable states remain the same as described in the initial state.
