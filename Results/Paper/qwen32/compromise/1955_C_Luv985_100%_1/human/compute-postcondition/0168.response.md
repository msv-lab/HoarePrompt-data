Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `T` is `T - 1`, `t` is 0 or 1 if the loop terminates due to `mi * 2 > k`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `l` is 0, and `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - mi * 2`, `a[l]` is decremented by `mi`, `a[r]` is decremented by `mi`, and if `a[r]` is 0, `r` is set to `n - 2` and `ans` is set to 2 if `a[l]` was also 0 and `l` is 1, otherwise `ans` is set to 1. If `a[r]` is not 0, `ans` remains 0 and `r` remains `n - 1`. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is set to `k % 2`, and if `a[l] - t - k // 2` equals 0, `ans` is set to 1, otherwise `ans` remains 0.**
