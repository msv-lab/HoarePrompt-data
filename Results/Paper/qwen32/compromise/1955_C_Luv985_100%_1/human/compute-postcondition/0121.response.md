Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `T` is `T - 1`, `t` will be either 0 or 1 if the loop terminates due to `mi * 2 > k`, otherwise it remains the same, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in `input().split()` to integers with `a[l]` reduced by `mi` and `a[r]` further reduced by `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `l` is 0, `r` is at least 1, `ans` is 4 if both `a[l]` and `a[r]` were 0 after reduction, 3 if either `a[l]` or `a[r]` was 0 after reduction, and 2 otherwise if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, and `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`. `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, `k` is `k - mi * 2`.** 

Explanation: The value of `k` is decreased by `mi * 2`. The values of `n`, `T`, `t`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `ans`, and `mi` remain as per the initial state description unless further modified by subsequent code.
