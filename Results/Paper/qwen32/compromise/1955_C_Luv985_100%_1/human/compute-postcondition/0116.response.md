Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - mi * 2` if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `k` remains greater than 0, `T` is `T - 1`, `t` will be either 0 or 1 if the loop terminates due to `mi * 2 > k`, otherwise it remains the same, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in `input().split()` to integers with `a[l]` reduced by `mi` and `a[r]` further reduced by `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `l` is 1 if `a[l]` was 0 after reduction, otherwise `l` remains 0, `r` is adjusted based on whether `a[r]` was 0 after reduction, `ans` is 4 if both `a[l]` and `a[r]` were 0 after reduction, 3 if either `a[l]` or `a[r]` was 0 after reduction, and 2 otherwise if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, and `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`.**
