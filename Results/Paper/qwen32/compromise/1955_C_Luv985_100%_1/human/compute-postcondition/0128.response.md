Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `T` is `T - 1`, `t` is either 0 or 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in `input().split()` to integers with `a[l]` reduced by `mi` and `a[r]` further reduced by `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `l` is 0, `r` is at least 1, `ans` is 4 if both `a[l]` and `a[r]` were 0 after reduction, 3 if either `a[l]` or `a[r]` was 0 after reduction, and 2 otherwise if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, and `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to `k % 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
