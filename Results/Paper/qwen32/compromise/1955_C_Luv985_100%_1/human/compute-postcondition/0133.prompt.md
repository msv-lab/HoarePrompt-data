Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `T` is `T - 1`, `t` will be either 0 or 1 if the loop terminates due to `mi * 2 > k`, otherwise it remains the same, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in `input().split()` to integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `T` is `T - 1`, `t` will be either 0 or 1 if the loop terminates due to `mi * 2 > k`, otherwise it remains the same, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in `input().split()` to integers, `l` is 0 or 1 based on whether `a[l]` was 0, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 1` based on whether `a[r]` was 0, `ans` is 2 if both `a[l]` and `a[r]` were 0, 1 if either `a[l]` or `a[r]` was 0, and 0 otherwise, and `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` (before any reduction). If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is reduced by `mi * 2`, `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` are each reduced by `mi`, and `ans` is determined based on the values of `a[l]` and `a[r]` after reduction. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is set to `k % 2`, and `ans` is 1 if `a[l] - t - k // 2` equals 0, otherwise `ans` remains 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - mi * 2` if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `k` remains greater than 0, `T` is `T - 1`, `t` will be either 0 or 1 if the loop terminates due to `mi * 2 > k`, otherwise it remains the same, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in `input().split()` to integers with `a[l]` reduced by `mi` and `a[r]` further reduced by `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `l` is 1 if `a[l]` was 0 after reduction, otherwise `l` remains 0, `r` is adjusted based on whether `a[r]` was 0 after reduction, `ans` is 4 if both `a[l]` and `a[r]` were 0 after reduction, 3 if either `a[l]` or `a[r]` was 0 after reduction, and 2 otherwise if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, and `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `T` is `T - 1`, `t` will be either 0 or 1 if the loop terminates due to `mi * 2 > k`, otherwise it remains the same, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in `input().split()` to integers with `a[l]` reduced by `mi` and `a[r]` further reduced by `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, `k` is `k - mi * 2`. If `a[l]` is 0, `l` is 1, otherwise `l` remains 0. If `a[r]` was 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 and `r` is `r - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. If `mi * 2 > k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
