Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4 (or `t` is either 0 or 1 if `mi * 2 > k`), `n` is greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0 and is now `k - mi * 2`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are adjusted by subtracting `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `a[l]` is adjusted by subtracting `mi` again, `a[r]` is adjusted by subtracting `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k` and then `a[r]` is adjusted by subtracting `mi` again, `l` is incremented to 1 if `mi * 2 <= k` or remains 0 otherwise, `r` is at least 1 if `l` is 0 or at least 2 if `l` is 1, `ans` is 2 if `ans` was 1, `ans` is 4 if `ans` was 3, `ans` is 3 if `ans` was 2, `ans` remains 1 if `ans` was 0, and `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`.**

In simpler terms, the only change is that `ans` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
