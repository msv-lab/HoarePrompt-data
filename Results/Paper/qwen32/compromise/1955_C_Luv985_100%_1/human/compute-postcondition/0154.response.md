Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 1, `k` must be greater than 0 and is now `k - mi * 2`, `T` is `T - 1`, `t` is 0 or 1 if the loop terminates due to `mi * 2 > k`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `a[l]` decremented by `mi` and `a[r]` decremented by `mi`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, and `ans` is 0; `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`. Additionally, `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`. The current value of `a[l]` is 0.**
