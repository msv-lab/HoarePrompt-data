Postcondition: **`T` is `T - 1`, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0 and `k` is now `k - mi * 2`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi` and `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - mi`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is min(a[0] + mi, a[n-1] + mi), and `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`. Additionally, `a[l]` is 0.**
