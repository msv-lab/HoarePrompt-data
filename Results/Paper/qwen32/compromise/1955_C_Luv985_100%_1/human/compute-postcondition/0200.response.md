Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `T` is `T - 1`, `t` is 0 or 1 if the loop terminates due to `mi * 2 > k`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` must be at least 1, and `mi` is the minimum between `a[l-1]` and `a[r]` before any potential decrements. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `a[l]` is decremented by `mi`, `a[r]` is decremented by `mi`, `l` is set to 1 if `a[0]` was 0, `r` is set to `r - 1` if `a[r]` was 0, `k` is decremented by `mi * 2`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `a[0]` or `a[r]` was 0. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is set to `k % 2`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`.**
