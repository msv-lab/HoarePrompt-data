Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `T` is `T - 1`, `t` is `k % 2` (which is 0 or 1), `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, and `mi * 2` is greater than `k`. Additionally, `a[l] - t - k // 2` equals 0.**
