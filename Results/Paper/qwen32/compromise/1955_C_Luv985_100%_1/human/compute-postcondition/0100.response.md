Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `T` is `T - 1`, `t` will be either 0 or 1 if the loop terminates due to `mi * 2 > k`, otherwise it remains the same, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in `input().split()` to integers, `l` is 0 or 1 based on whether `a[l]` was 0, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 1` based on whether `a[r]` was 0, `ans` is 2 if both `a[l]` and `a[r]` were 0, 1 if either `a[l]` or `a[r]` was 0, and 0 otherwise, and `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` (before any reduction). If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is reduced by `mi * 2`, `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` are each reduced by `mi`, and `ans` is determined based on the values of `a[l]` and `a[r]` after reduction. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is set to `k % 2`, and `ans` is 1 if `a[l] - t - k // 2` equals 0, otherwise `ans` remains 0.**
