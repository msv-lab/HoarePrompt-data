The code snippet assigns the value `n - 1` to the variable `r`. The other variables (`T`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is the integer representation of the corresponding string from the input string split by whitespace, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`.**
