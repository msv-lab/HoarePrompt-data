Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements; `r` is 0, `l` is 2; `over_sum` is `sm`; `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `sm` is `sum(lst[:0]) + sum(lst[2 + 1:]) + (2 - 0 + 1)`**

In this output state, the value of `over_sum` has been updated to be equal to `sm`. All other variables retain their initial values.
