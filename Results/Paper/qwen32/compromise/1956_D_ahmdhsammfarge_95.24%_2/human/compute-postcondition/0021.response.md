To determine the state necessary for the for loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `j`, `i`, and the length of `lst`.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means that for the loop to execute, the range `(i + 1, len(lst))` must be non-empty. This implies that `i + 1` must be less than `len(lst)`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `lst` is a list of integers.
- `r` and `l` are the indices of the pair `(i, j)` that maximize `sm`.
- `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the iterations.
- `i` has completed its iterations.

Since `i` has completed its iterations, it implies that the previous loop or logic has set `i` to a specific value. For the current loop to execute, `i` must be set such that `i + 1 < len(lst)`.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `r` and `l` are the indices of the pair `(i, j)` that maximize `sm`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the iterations, `i` must be less than `len(lst) - 1`**
