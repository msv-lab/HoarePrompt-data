The code snippet `ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])` appends the list `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list. The initial state already includes that `ops` now includes the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]`. Therefore, after executing this line, `ops` will have one more `[r + 1, l + 1]` appended to it. The values of `r`, `l`, and `lst` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, and `ops` is a list that will store the operations performed; `ops` now includes the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` twice. The minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0.**
