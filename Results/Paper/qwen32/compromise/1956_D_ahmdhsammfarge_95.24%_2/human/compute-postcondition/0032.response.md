The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `lst`. According to the loop statement, `j` iterates from `i + 1` to `len(lst) - 1`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 from its current value, and `lst` should remain the same.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `lst` is a list of integers.
- `i` must be less than `len(lst) - 1`.
- If `sm > over_sum`, then `r` is `i`, `l` is `j`, and `over_sum` is updated to `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`. Otherwise, `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` retain their original values.

To prepare for the next iteration:
- Increment `j` by 1.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `i` must be less than `len(lst) - 1`, `j` is incremented by 1**
