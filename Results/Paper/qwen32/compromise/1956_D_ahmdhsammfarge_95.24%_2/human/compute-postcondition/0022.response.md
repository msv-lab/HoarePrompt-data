The code snippet calculates the sum of elements before index `i` and after index `j` in the list `lst`, and adds the square of the length of the segment from `i` to `j` (inclusive). This calculated sum is stored in the variable `sm`.

Given the initial state, `sm` is not defined before this code snippet, so it is being initialized with the calculated value. The values of `lst`, `r`, `l`, `over_sum`, `i`, and `j` are provided or assumed to be defined in the initial state and are not altered by this line of code.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `r` and `l` are the indices of the pair `(i, j)` that maximize `sm`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the iterations, `i` must be less than `len(lst) - 1`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`**.
