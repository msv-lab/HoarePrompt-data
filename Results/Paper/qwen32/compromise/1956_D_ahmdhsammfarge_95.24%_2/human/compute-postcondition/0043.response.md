Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `r` and `l` are the indices `[i, j]` that maximize `sm`, `over_sum` is `sm`, `i` is 0, `sm` is `sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j + 1)`, and `sm` is greater than `over_sum`.**

Explanation: The value of `over_sum` has been updated to be equal to the value of `sm`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
