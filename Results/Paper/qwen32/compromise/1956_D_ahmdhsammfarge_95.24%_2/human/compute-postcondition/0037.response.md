To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the loop's purpose and how the variables `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` are updated.

The loop iterates over all possible pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j` and calculates a value `sm` for each pair. The value `sm` is computed as the sum of all elements in `lst` except those between `i` and `j`, plus the square of the number of elements between `i` and `j` inclusive. The goal is to find the pair `(i, j)` that maximizes `sm` and to keep track of the maximum value of `sm` found (`over_sum`), along with the corresponding indices `r` and `l`.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that the loop continues until `j` has iterated through all possible values for the given `i`. Once `j` reaches the end of the list for a particular `i`, `i` is incremented, and the process repeats until `i` is no longer less than `len(lst) - 1`.

The final output state is reached when all possible pairs `(i, j)` have been evaluated. At this point, `r` and `l` will hold the indices of the pair that maximizes `sm`, and `over_sum` will hold the maximum value of `sm` found.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `r` and `l` are the indices of the pair `(i, j)` that maximize `sm`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the iterations, and `i` is no longer less than `len(lst) - 1`.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is the state where the loop has evaluated all possible pairs `(i, j)` in the list `lst`, and `r` and `l` represent the indices of the pair that gives the highest `sm` value, with `over_sum` being that highest `sm` value. The loop has completed all its iterations, and `i` is now at a value that is not less than `len(lst) - 1`.
