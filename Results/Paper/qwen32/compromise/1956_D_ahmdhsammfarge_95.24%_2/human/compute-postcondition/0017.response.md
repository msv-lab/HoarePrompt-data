Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `r` is 0, `l` is 2, `over_sum` is `sum(lst[3:]) + 9`, `i` is 0, `sm` is `sum(lst[3:]) + 9`, `j` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `over_sum` has been updated to be equal to the value of `sm`, which is `sum(lst[3:]) + 9`. All other variables retain their initial values.
