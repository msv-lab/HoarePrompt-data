You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

    #State: The final output is the concatenation of all `ans` strings from each of the `t` test cases.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the problem description. The issue lies in the way the string `ans` is being constructed. The code attempts to use the values in the `array` to index into the `s` list, which is initialized to all zeros. However, the values in `array` represent the number of previous occurrences of the character at that position, not an index into the `s` list.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the code is incorrect:

1. The `array` contains the number of previous occurrences of the character at each position.
2. The `s` list is used to keep track of how many times each character has been used so far.
3. The line `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)` is incorrect because `s[j]` is not the index of the character to use; it is the count of how many times the character at position `j` has appeared before.
4. The line `s[j] += 1` increments the count of the character at position `j`, but this count is not being used correctly to determine which character to use next.

To fix the code, we need to use a different approach to map the counts to characters. Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        trace = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = [''] * n
        char_count = [0] * 26  # To keep track of how many times each character has been used
        for j in range(n):
            count = trace[j]
            # Find the next available character with the correct count
            for c in range(26):
                if char_count[c] == count:
                    s[j] = chr(c + 97)
                    char_count[c] += 1
                    break
        print(''.join(s))

# Example usage:
# func()
```

In this corrected version, we use `char_count` to keep track of how many times each character has been used. For each position `j` in the string, we find the next available character that has been used exactly `trace[j]` times. This ensures that the string `s` is constructed correctly according to the trace.
