The code snippet `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)` modifies the variable `ans` by appending a character to it. The character is determined by the value of `s[j] + 97`. Given that `s[j]` is 1 (as per the initial state description), `s[j] + 97` evaluates to `1 + 97`, which is `98`. The `chr` function converts the integer `98` to its corresponding ASCII character, which is `'b'`. Therefore, `ans` is updated from `'a'` to `'ab'`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros except `s[j]` which is 1, `array` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one more element, `ans` is the string 'ab'**.
