The code snippet reads a new list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `array`. This means the previous value of `array` is replaced with the newly input list of integers. The other variables (`t`, `l`, `s`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l` is the newly input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros, `array` is the newly input list of integers, `ans` is a string formed by appending characters `chr(s[j] + 97)` for each `j` in the previous `array`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
