The only object in the loop head is the variable `j`, which iterates over `array`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `array`. Since `array` must have at least one more element, the loop can execute again with the next element of `array`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` was the last element processed from `array`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be the next element in `array`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros except `s[j]` which is 2, `array` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one more element, `ans` is the string 'ab', `j` is the next element in `array`**
