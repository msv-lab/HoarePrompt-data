The code snippet `s[j] += 1` increments the value at index `j` of the list `s` by 1. Given that `s` is a list of `l` zeros, after the operation, the element at index `j` will be 1, and all other elements in `s` will remain 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l` is an input integer; `s` is a list of `l` zeros except `s[j]` which is 1; `array` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element; `ans` is the string 'a'**.
