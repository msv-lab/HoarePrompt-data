To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the behavior of the loop described in the problem. The loop iterates over each element `j` in the `array` and performs the following operations:
1. Appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value `s[j] + 97` to the string `ans`.
2. Increments the value of `s[j]` by 1.

From the given output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
- After the first iteration, `s[j]` is 1, and `ans` is `'a'`.
- After the second iteration, `s[j]` is 2, and `ans` is `'ab'`.
- After the third iteration, `s[j]` is 3, and `ans` is `'abc'`.

This pattern suggests that for each element `j` in `array`, the character corresponding to the ASCII value `s[j] + 97` is appended to `ans`, and `s[j]` is incremented by 1.

The loop will continue to execute until all elements in `array` have been processed. Therefore, the final output state will be:
- `t` remains the same integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `l` remains the same newly input integer.
- `s` will be a list of `l` integers where each element `s[j]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `j` in `array`.
- `array` remains the same list of integers.
- `ans` will be a string formed by concatenating the characters corresponding to the ASCII values `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array`.

The final `ans` string is constructed by appending characters based on the number of times each index in `array` appears. Each index `j` in `array` will contribute a character to `ans` starting from `'a'` (when `s[j]` is 0) and incrementing the character for each subsequent occurrence of `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l` is the newly input integer, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element `s[j]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `j` in `array`, `array` is the newly input list of integers, `ans` is a string formed by concatenating the characters corresponding to the ASCII values `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array`.**
