The code snippet `ans = ''` sets the variable `ans` to an empty string. This change affects the value of `ans`, but the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l` is the newly input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros, `array` is the newly input list of integers, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is incremented by 1.**
