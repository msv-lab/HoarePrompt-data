The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable in the `for` loop. The loop runs for a number of times equal to the integer read from the input. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we only need to adjust the value of `i`.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l` is an input integer; `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j` appears in `array`; `array` is a list of integers read from the input; `ans` is a string formed by concatenating characters corresponding to the values in `s` after all iterations; `i` is the loop variable.

Since the loop runs for `int(input())` iterations, and assuming that `i` has just completed an iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 to get the state at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l` is an input integer; `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j` appears in `array`; `array` is a list of integers read from the input; `ans` is a string formed by concatenating characters corresponding to the values in `s` after all iterations; `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more precise, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l` is an input integer; `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j` appears in `array`; `array` is a list of integers read from the input; `ans` is a string formed by concatenating characters corresponding to the values in `s` after all iterations; `i` is `i + 1`**.
