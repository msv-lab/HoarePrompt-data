To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet step-by-step.

### Initial State:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This represents the number of test cases, but it's not directly relevant to the print statement in question.
2. **`l`**: A newly input integer that specifies the length of the list `s`.
3. **`s`**: A list of `l` integers. Each element `s[j]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `j` in `array`. This means `s[j]` counts the number of times `j` appears in `array`.
4. **`array`**: A newly input list of integers. The values in `array` determine how `s` is populated.
5. **`ans`**: A string formed by concatenating the characters corresponding to the ASCII values `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array`. This means for each integer `j` in `array`, the character corresponding to `s[j] + 97` in the ASCII table is added to `ans`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Explanation:
- **`s[j]`**: This is the count of how many times `j` appears in the `array`. For example, if `j` appears 3 times in `array`, `s[j]` will be 3.
- **`s[j] + 97`**: This expression converts the count into an ASCII value. Since `97` is the ASCII value for the character `'a'`, `s[j] + 97` will give the ASCII value for the character that is `s[j]` positions after `'a'`.
- **`ans`**: This string is constructed by taking each integer `j` in `array`, finding the corresponding `s[j]`, converting `s[j] + 97` to a character, and concatenating these characters together.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider an example to make it clearer:
- Suppose `array = [0, 1, 2, 1]`.
- Suppose `l = 3` (since `s` is a list of `l` integers).
- Then `s` will be `[1, 2, 1]` because:
  - `0` appears once in `array`, so `s[0] = 1`.
  - `1` appears twice in `array`, so `s[1] = 2`.
  - `2` appears once in `array`, so `s[2] = 1`.
- Now, `ans` will be constructed as follows:
  - For the first element `0` in `array`, `s[0] = 1`, so the character is `chr(1 + 97) = 'b'`.
  - For the second element `1` in `array`, `s[1] = 2`, so the character is `chr(2 + 97) = 'c'`.
  - For the third element `2` in `array`, `s[2] = 1`, so the character is `chr(1 + 97) = 'b'`.
  - For the fourth element `1` in `array`, `s[1] = 2`, so the character is `chr(2 + 97) = 'c'`.
- Therefore, `ans` will be `'bccb'`.

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the string `ans` which is formed by the described process.

Output: **ans (where ans is the string formed by concatenating characters corresponding to the ASCII values `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array`)**
