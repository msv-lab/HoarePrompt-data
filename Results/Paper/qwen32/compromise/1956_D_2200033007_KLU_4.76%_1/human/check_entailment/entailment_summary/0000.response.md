Reasoning:
The given program does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem as described. The program only checks if the length of the array is 2 and prints a hardcoded result for that specific case. For all other cases, it prints another hardcoded result. This approach does not take into account the actual values in the array or the operations needed to maximize the sum of the array.

The program should:
1. Calculate the MEX of different subarrays.
2. Perform operations to maximize the sum of the array based on the calculated MEX values.
3. Keep track of the number of operations performed.
4. Output the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.

Since the program does not follow these steps and instead relies on hardcoded outputs, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
