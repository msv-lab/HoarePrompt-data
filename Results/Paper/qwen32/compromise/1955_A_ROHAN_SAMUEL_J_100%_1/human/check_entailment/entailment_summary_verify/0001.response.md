Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to ensure the correctness of the solution. We will validate the logic by examining the code and comparing it with the problem description and the function summary.

### Problem Description Recap
Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts. The cost is `a` burles per yogurt if bought individually, or `b` burles for a pair of yogurts. We need to determine the minimum cost to buy exactly `n` yogurts.

### Key Points Recap
- If `n` is even, the optimal strategy is to buy `n/2` pairs unless `2 * a < b`, in which case buying individually is cheaper.
- If `n` is odd, the strategy is to buy `(n-1)/2` pairs and then buy the remaining yogurt individually.

### Program Analysis
The provided program uses the following logic:
1. For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. If `n` is odd (`n % 2`):
   - If `2 * a < b`, it calculates the cost as `a * n` (buying all individually).
   - Otherwise, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a` (buying as many pairs as possible and the remaining one individually).
3. If `n` is even:
   - If `2 * a < b`, it calculates the cost as `a * n` (buying all individually).
   - Otherwise, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b` (buying all as pairs).

### Function Summary Recap
The function summary correctly describes the logic used by the program:
- For odd `n`, it compares `2 * a` with `b` to determine the cost.
- For even `n`, it similarly compares `2 * a` with `b` to decide whether to use `a * n` or `n // 2 * b` for the cost.

### Example Walkthrough
Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:
- **Third Test Case (`3 5 11`)**:
  - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `n` is odd.
  - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`, so it should buy all individually.
  - The program calculates `a * n = 3 * 5 = 15`, which is correct.
- **Fourth Test Case (`4 5 11`)**:
  - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `n` is even.
  - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`, so it should buy all individually.
  - The program calculates `a * n = 4 * 5 = 20`, which is correct.

### Verification
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and the function summary. It handles both odd and even values of `n` appropriately and makes the correct decision based on the comparison of `2 * a` and `b`.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly determines the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions.

Final: **True**
