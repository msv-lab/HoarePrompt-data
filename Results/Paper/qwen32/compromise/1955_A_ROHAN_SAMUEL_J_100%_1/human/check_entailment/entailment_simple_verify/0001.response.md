Let's analyze the provided program and the annotations to validate the correctness of the original assessment.

### Problem Understanding
The problem requires us to determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts, given the price `a` for one yogurt and the price `b` for two yogurts under promotion.

### Key Points
- If `n` is even, the optimal strategy is to buy `n/2` pairs of yogurts unless `2 * a < b`, in which case buying individually is cheaper.
- If `n` is odd, the strategy is to buy as many pairs as possible (`(n-1)/2` pairs) and then buy the remaining yogurt individually.

### Program Analysis
Let's review the program's logic and the annotations:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)
```

#### Annotations:
- The annotations indicate that the program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- It then checks if `n` is odd (`n % 2`):
  - If `n` is odd, it checks if `2 * a < b`:
    - If true, it prints `a * n` (buying all individually).
    - If false, it prints `n // 2 * b + a` (buying as many pairs as possible and the remaining one individually).
- If `n` is even, it checks if `2 * a < b`:
  - If true, it prints `a * n` (buying all individually).
  - If false, it prints `n // 2 * b` (buying all as pairs).

### Example Walkthrough
Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

- **Third test case (`3 5 11`)**:
  - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `n` is odd.
  - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`, so it should buy all individually.
  - The program checks `2 * a < b` and since it's true, it calculates `a * n = 3 * 5 = 15`.
  - **Correct**.

- **Fourth test case (`4 5 11`)**:
  - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `n` is even.
  - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`, so it should buy all individually.
  - The program checks `2 * a < b` and since it's true, it calculates `a * n = 4 * 5 = 20`.
  - **Correct**.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions. The annotations and the logic in the program match the problem requirements and the examples provided in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
