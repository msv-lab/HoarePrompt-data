Reasoning: 

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum cost for purchasing `n` yogurts based on the given conditions. Here's a detailed breakdown of the program logic and its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Odd `n` Handling**:
   - When `n` is odd, the program calculates the cost by considering two possibilities:
     - Buying all yogurts individually, which would cost `a * n` burles.
     - Buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotional price `b` and one yogurt individually at the price `a`, which would cost `n // 2 * b + a` burles.
   - The program then prints the minimum of these two costs.

3. **Even `n` Handling**:
   - When `n` is even, the program again considers two possibilities:
     - Buying all yogurts individually, which would cost `a * n` burles.
     - Buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotional price `b`, which would cost `n // 2 * b` burles.
   - The program then prints the minimum of these two costs.

4. **Comparison Logic**:
   - The comparison `2 * a < b` is used to determine whether it is cheaper to buy yogurts individually or in pairs. If `2 * a` is less than `b`, it's cheaper to buy yogurts individually; otherwise, it's cheaper to buy them in pairs.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where `n` is 1 or 2 correctly.
   - It also handles cases where the promotion price `b` is higher than or equal to the price of two individual yogurts (`2 * a`).

The provided execution summary aligns with the program's logic and correctly describes how the program determines the minimum cost for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
