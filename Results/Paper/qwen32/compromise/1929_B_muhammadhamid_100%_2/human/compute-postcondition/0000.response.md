In the provided code snippet, the for loop is iterating over a range determined by the input value. The loop head contains only one variable: `_`, which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`, which is the number of test cases.

Given this, the only variable in the loop head that we can adjust is the input itself. To ensure that the loop executes, we need to make sure that the number of test cases is at least 1.

State: **The function will receive multiple test cases, where the number of test cases (input value) must be greater than or equal to 1.**

In other words, we need to ensure that the input value is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The values of `n` and `k` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted according to the given constraints.
