You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

    1 2 9 10 10 2 10 2
    
    4 5

Output

    Sasha
    Anna
    Anna
    Sasha
    Sasha
    Anna
    Anna
    Anna
    Sasha
    
Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

- Program:
def func():
    for y in range(int(input())):
        rev_val = []
        rev_res = ''
        (list_len, max_power) = input().split()
        operational_list = input().split()
        for x in operational_list:
            x_rev = int(x[::-1])
            if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
                rev_res = rev_res + x
            else:
                rev_val.append(x[::-1])
        rev_val.sort()
        for x in range(len(rev_val)):
            if x % 2 == 0:
                val_in = int(rev_val[x])
                rev_res += str(val_in)
            else:
                val_in = rev_val[x]
                rev_res += val_in[::-1]
        if 10 ** int(max_power) < int(rev_res):
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Anna')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `m`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines whether to print "Sasha" or "Anna" based on the reversed values of the integers in `a` and the value of `m`. Specifically, it reverses each integer in `a`, sorts the reversed integers of certain lengths, and constructs a result string. If the integer value of this result string exceeds `10` raised to the power of `m`, it prints "Sasha"; otherwise, it prints "Anna".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Here are a few issues and potential edge cases that the program does not handle correctly:

1. **Concatenation Strategy**: The program concatenates the reversed values in a specific order without considering the optimal strategy for Sasha to maximize the final number. The program simply concatenates the sorted reversed values in an alternating order, which may not yield the maximum possible number.

2. **Handling of Reversals**: The program only reverses the numbers and concatenates them in a specific manner without considering the optimal moves for both players. It does not simulate the game turns for both Anna and Sasha.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where the numbers are already large and might not require any reversals or concatenations to meet the condition.

4. **Sorting and Concatenation**: The program sorts the reversed values and concatenates them in an alternating manner, which might not be optimal. Sasha can strategically choose which numbers to concatenate to maximize the final number.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
3 5
9 56 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Anna
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
- Anna can reverse the number 1, making it 1.
- Sasha can concatenate 9 and 56 to form 956.
- Sasha can then concatenate 956 and 1 to form 9561.
- Since 9561 is greater than \(10^5\), Sasha would win. However, Sasha's optimal move should be to concatenate 56 and 9 to form 569, and then concatenate 569 and 1 to form 5691, which is less than \(10^5\). Therefore, Anna wins.

The program does not consider such strategic moves and concatenations, leading to incorrect results in some cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
