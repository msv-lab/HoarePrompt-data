Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and `rev_val` is an empty list; `rev_res` is an empty string; `list_len` is a string representing the first input value; `max_power` is a string representing the second input value; `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.
Code of the loop:
for x in operational_list:
    x_rev = int(x[::-1])
    if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
        rev_res = rev_res + x
    else:
        rev_val.append(x[::-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `rev_val` is an empty list, `list_len` is a string representing the first input value, `max_power` is a string representing the second input value, and `operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least one string. If `x_rev` is defined and the length of `str(x_rev)` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is set to the string value of `x`. Otherwise, `rev_res` is an empty string and a `NameError` is raised because `x` is not defined.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `list_len` is a string representing the first input value, `max_power` is a string representing the second input value, and `operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least one string. `x` is the next element in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of `x` reversed. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `list_len` is a string representing the first input value, `max_power` is a string representing the second input value, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least one string, `x` is the next element in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of `x` reversed. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is the previous value of `rev_res` concatenated with `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` includes the reversed string `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
