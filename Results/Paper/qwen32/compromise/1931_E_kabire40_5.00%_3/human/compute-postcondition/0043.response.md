Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `rev_val` is a sorted list of strings with at least one string, `list_len` is a string representing the first input value, `max_power` is a string representing the second input value, `x` is 4. If `x` is even, `val_in` is set to `int(rev_val[4])` and `rev_res` is updated to include the string representation of `val_in`. Otherwise, `val_in` is set to `rev_val[4]` and `rev_res` is updated to include the reverse of `rev_val[4]` appended to its previous value.**
