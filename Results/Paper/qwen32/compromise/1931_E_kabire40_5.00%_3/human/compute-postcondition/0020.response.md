The code snippet `rev_val.append(x[::-1])` appends the reverse of the string `x` to the list `rev_val`.

Given the initial state, `x` is a string (the next element in `operational_list`), and `x[::-1]` represents the reversed version of `x`. Therefore, `rev_val` will now include this reversed string.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `operational_list`, `x_rev`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `list_len` is a string representing the first input value, `max_power` is a string representing the second input value, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least one string, `x` is the next element in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of `x` reversed, `rev_val` includes the reversed string `x`.**
