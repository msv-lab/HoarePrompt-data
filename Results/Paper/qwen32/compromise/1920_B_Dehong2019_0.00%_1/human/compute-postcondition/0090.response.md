To determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the pattern of how `ans1` and `ans` evolve with each iteration of the loop.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t-2 ≤ 10^4.
- `n`, `k`, `x` are integers with the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `x` > 0.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order.
- `i` is initialized to `x-1`.
- `ans1` and `ans2` are initialized to `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`.
- `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` observed during the loop.

### Loop Iterations:
The loop iterates `k` times, and in each iteration:
- `ans1` is updated by adding `a[i]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x]` if `i + x < n`.
- `ans` is updated to be the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

### Final State Analysis:
- After `k` iterations, `i` will have taken on the values `x-1, x, x+1, ..., x+(k-1)`.
- `ans1` will have been adjusted by adding `a[x-1] + a[x] + ... + a[x+(k-1)]` and subtracting `2 * a[x] + 2 * a[x+1] + ... + 2 * a[x+(k-1)]` if `i + x < n` for each corresponding `i`.
- `ans2` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- `ans` will be the maximum value of `ans1` and `ans2` observed during the loop.

### Final Output State:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n`, `k`, `x` remain unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `i` will be `x + (k-1)`.
- `ans1` will be `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + (a[x-1] + a[x] + ... + a[x+(k-1)]) - 2 * (a[x] + a[x+1] + ... + a[x+(k-1)])` if `x + (k-1) < n`, otherwise it will be `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + (a[x-1] + a[x] + ... + a[x+(k-1)])`.
- `ans2` remains unchanged.
- `ans` will be the maximum of the final `ans1` and `ans2`.

### Final Output State in the Required Format:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t-2 ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `x` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order as read from the input; `i` is `x + (k-1)`; `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + (a[x-1] + a[x] + ... + a[x+(k-1)]) - 2 * (a[x] + a[x+1] + ... + a[x+(k-1)])` if `x + (k-1) < n`, otherwise it is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + (a[x-1] + a[x] + ... + a[x+(k-1)])`; `ans2` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`; `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` observed during the loop.**

### Natural Language Description:
After the loop has executed all its `k` iterations, the variable `i` will be `x + (k-1)`. The variable `ans1` will be adjusted to account for the additions and subtractions based on the elements in the array `a` from index `x-1` to `x+(k-1)`. The variable `ans2` remains unchanged, and `ans` will hold the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2` observed during the loop. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
