The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `x`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `x` must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n; the array `a` contains n integers sorted in descending order where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000; `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the array `a` minus `a[0] * 2` minus `a[1] * 2`; `i` is 2, `x` must be greater than 1**
