The code snippet `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2` modifies the value of `ans1`. The value of `ans1` is decreased by twice the value of the element at index `i + x` in the array `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n.
- The array `a` contains `n` integers sorted in descending order where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000.
- `i` is `x` if `x > 0`, otherwise `i` is `1`.
- `ans2` is equal to `ans1` before the increment.
- `ans1` is updated to `ans1` before the increment plus `a[i]`.
- `ans` is the maximum of the updated `ans1` and `ans2`.

The only variable affected by the code snippet is `ans1`, which is now decreased by `a[i + x] * 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n; the array `a` contains `n` integers sorted in descending order where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000; `i` is `x` if `x > 0`, otherwise `i` is `1`; `ans2` is equal to `ans1` before the increment; `ans1` is updated to `ans1` before the increment plus `a[i]` and then decreased by `a[i + x] * 2`; `ans` is the maximum of the updated `ans1` and `ans2`.**
