The code snippet `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` modifies the value of `ans1` by subtracting `a[i] * 2` from it. The values of `i`, `a`, and `ans1` are affected by this operation. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `ans1` is initially `sum(a) - a[k-1] * 2 - a[i] * 2`. After executing the code snippet, `ans1` becomes `sum(a) - a[k-1] * 2 - a[i] * 2 - a[i] * 2`, which simplifies to `sum(a) - a[k-1] * 2 - a[i] * 4`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `x` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order as read from the input; `i` is `k + 1`; `ans1` is `sum(a) - a[k-1] * 2 - a[i] * 4`; `ans2` is the value of `ans1` from the last iteration; `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` observed during the loop.**
