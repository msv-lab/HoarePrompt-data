Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n; the array `a` contains `n` integers sorted in descending order where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000; `i` is `i + 1`; `ans1` is increased by `a[i]` and then decreased by `a[i + x] * 2`.**

In simpler terms, after executing the code, the value of `ans1` is updated by adding `a[i]` and then subtracting `2 * a[i + x]`. The values of other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged, except `i` which is incremented by 1.
