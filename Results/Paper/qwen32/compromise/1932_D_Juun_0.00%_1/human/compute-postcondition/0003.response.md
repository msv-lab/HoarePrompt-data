The given Python code snippet initializes an empty list named `answers`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `trump_suit`, `cards`, `trump`, or `trumps`) are modified by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16, `trump_suit` is one of the characters 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S', and `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where each string represents a card with the first character being one of '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9' and the second character being one of 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'; `trump` is an input character; `trumps` is an empty list; `answers` is an empty list.**
