The code snippet initializes an empty list named `total_costs`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, or `costs`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state except for the new addition of `total_costs`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are updated to the values provided in the input; `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid and contains `m` integers, with the first and last integers in each sublist being 0; `costs` is a list where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`; `total_costs` is an empty list.**
