To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and understand its impact on the variables.

The code snippet is:
```python
costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
```

This line of code creates a new list called `costs` by applying the function `func_1` to each row in the `rows` list, with `d` as a second argument for each call to `func_1`.

Here's the impact of the code on the program:
- The variable `costs` is created and assigned a list of values. Each value in this list is the result of calling `func_1` with a row from `rows` and `d` as arguments.
- The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.
- The variable `rows` remains unchanged as the function `func_1` is only called on its elements, not on `rows` itself.

Since the specific implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values in the `costs` list. However, we can describe the output state in terms of the changes made.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are updated to the values provided in the input; `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid and contains `m` integers, with the first and last integers in each sublist being 0; `costs` is a list where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`.**
