### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:

1. **Purpose**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the cost of placing supports in a single row of the river grid, ensuring that the distance between supports is no more than `d`.

2. **Implementation**:
   - The first loop increments the first `d-1` elements of the row by 1.
   - The second loop calculates the cost for each subsequent element by adding the minimum value of the previous `d` elements plus 1 to the current cell. This logic aims to ensure that the supports are placed with the required distance constraint.

3. **Issues**:
   - The logic `row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1` is flawed. It does not correctly enforce the distance constraint `d` between supports. It simply adds the minimum of the previous `d` cells plus 1 to the current cell, which does not guarantee that the supports will be placed with the required distance.

4. **Example**:
   - Consider a row `[0, 1, 2, 1, 0]` and `d = 2`. The function will incorrectly calculate the cost as `[1, 2, 3, 3, 1]` instead of ensuring that supports are placed with at least 2 cells apart.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:

1. **Purpose**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input parameters and the grid, calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`, and then finds the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.

2. **Implementation**:
   - It reads the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
   - It reads the grid of depths.
   - It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It sums the costs for all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum sum.

3. **Issues**:
   - Since `func_1` does not correctly calculate the cost for a single row with the required constraints, the total cost for `k` consecutive rows will also be incorrect.
   - The function does not consider the interaction between the rows when calculating the total cost.

4. **Example**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     3 5 2 2
     0 1 2 1 0
     0 2 3 2 0
     0 1 2 1 0
     ```
   - The correct output should be `8` because the optimal placement of supports would be:
     - Row 1: Supports at positions 1, 3, 5 (cost = 0 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 4)
     - Row 2: Supports at positions 1, 3, 5 (cost = 0 + 3 + 0 + 2 = 5)
     - Row 3: Supports at positions 1, 3, 5 (cost = 0 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 4)
   - The total cost for rows 1 and 2 would be `4 + 4 = 8`.
   - The provided program will not produce this result because `func_1` does not correctly calculate the cost for a single row with the required constraints.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the minimum total cost of installing supports for the bridges. The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the placement of supports with the required distance constraint, and `func_2` does not correctly calculate the total cost for `k` consecutive rows due to the issues in `func_1`.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
