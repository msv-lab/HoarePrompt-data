Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum cost of installing supports for the bridges. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation in `func_1`**:
    - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the minimum cost of placing supports in a single row under the given constraints. However, it does not correctly handle the placement of supports with the distance constraint `d`.
    - Specifically, the function adds 1 to the first `d-1` elements unconditionally, which does not ensure that the minimum cost is achieved by placing supports with the required distance `d` apart.
    - The function also incorrectly calculates the minimum cost for the rest of the row by considering a sliding window of size `d+1`, which does not guarantee the correct placement of supports.

2. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**:
    - The results from `func_1` are summed up for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows to compute the total cost. However, since `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for a single row, the total cost calculated for `k` rows will also be incorrect.

3. **Optimization Issues**:
    - The problem can be solved using dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum cost of placing supports with the given constraints. The provided solution does not use such an approach and instead relies on a simplified and incorrect approach.

To solve this problem correctly, a dynamic programming approach should be used to ensure that the constraints are met while minimizing the cost. The dynamic programming table would need to keep track of the minimum cost to place supports up to each column with the required distance `d` apart.
