### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the provided program and the original assessment based on the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- **Grid**: The river is represented as a grid with `n` rows and `m` columns, where the depth of the river in each cell is given by `a_{i,j}`.
- **Constraints**:
  - Supports must be placed in the first and last columns (depth is 0).
  - The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
  - We need to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows to minimize the total cost.
- **Cost Calculation**: The cost to place a support in cell `(i,j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: Calculate the minimum cost of placing supports in a single row with the given distance constraint `d`.
   - **Logic**:
     - The first loop sets the cost for the first `d-1` cells.
     - The second loop calculates the cost for the rest of the cells based on the minimum cost of the previous `d` cells plus 1.
   - **Issues**:
     - The logic used in `func_1` does not correctly implement the placement of supports with the required distance `d`.
     - The function does not ensure that the supports are placed such that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
     - The use of `min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i])` does not correctly account for the distance constraint.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: Calculate the minimum total cost of placing `k` consecutive bridges in the grid.
   - **Logic**:
     - Reads input parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
     - Reads the grid `rows`.
     - Uses `func_1` to calculate the cost for each row.
     - Sums the costs for `k` consecutive rows to find the minimum total cost.
   - **Issues**:
     - Since `func_1` does not correctly calculate the cost for a single row, the total cost for `k` consecutive rows will also be incorrect.
     - The function does not consider the interaction between the rows when calculating the total cost.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the example provided in the original assessment:
```
1
3 5 2 2
0 1 2 1 0
0 2 3 2 0
0 1 2 1 0
```
- **Correct Output**: `8`
- **Explanation**: Supports should be placed at positions 1, 3, 5 in both rows 1 and 3, resulting in a cost of `4` for each row, summing up to `8`.

The provided program will not produce this result because `func_1` does not correctly calculate the cost for a single row with the required constraints.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly handle the placement of supports with the required distance constraint and does not correctly calculate the total cost for `k` consecutive rows.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
