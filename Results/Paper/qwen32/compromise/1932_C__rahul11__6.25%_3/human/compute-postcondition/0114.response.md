The code snippet `r = n - 1` sets the variable `r` to the value of `n - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is `ans % m % MOD` and the rest are 0, `ans` is the product of all integers in `arr`, `c` is 1, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 1`.**
