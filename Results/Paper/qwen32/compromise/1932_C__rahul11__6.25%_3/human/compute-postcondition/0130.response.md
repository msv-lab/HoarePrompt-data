Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is `ans % m % MOD` and the second element is `ans % m % MOD`, and the rest are 0, `ans` is `(ans // arr[r]) % MOD`, `c` is 2, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 2`, `k` is `n - 2`**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is updated to be `(ans // arr[r]) % MOD`. All other variables retain their previous values.
