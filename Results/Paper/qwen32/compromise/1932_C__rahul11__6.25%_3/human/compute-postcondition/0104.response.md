The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over `arr`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `arr` is not empty for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state, `arr` is described as "a new list of integers read from the input." To guarantee that the loop executes, `arr` must have at least one integer.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `arr` is a new list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 integer, `s` is a new list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers where each element is 0, `ans` is 1, `c` is `n`, `l` is between 0 and `n-1` depending on the number of 'L' characters, and `r` is between 0 and `n-1` depending on the number of non-'L' characters**.
