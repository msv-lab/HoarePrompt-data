The code snippet provided increments the variable `c` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Here's the detailed output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element updated to `ans % m % MOD` and the second element updated to `ans % m % MOD`. If `s[k]` is 'L', then `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` divided by `arr[l]` and then taken modulo `MOD`, `c` is 2, `l` is 1, and `r` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` except the last element, modulo `MOD`, `c` is 2, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 2`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `c` is now 2, while all other variables retain their previous values.
