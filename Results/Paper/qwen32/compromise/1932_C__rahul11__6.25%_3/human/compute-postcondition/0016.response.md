The code snippet provided is `l = 0`, which assigns the value `0` to the variable `l`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `res`, `ans`, `c`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element updated to `ans % m % MOD`, and `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr`, `c` is 1, `l` is 0.**
