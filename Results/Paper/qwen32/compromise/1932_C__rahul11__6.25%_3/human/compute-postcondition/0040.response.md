The code provided calculates the value of `ans` by performing integer division of `ans` by `arr[l]` and then taking the modulus of the result with `MOD`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `res`, `k`, and `c` are not affected by this operation.

Given that the operation is `ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD`, the new value of `ans` will be the result of this expression. Since the specific values of `ans`, `arr[l]`, and `MOD` are not provided, we can only express the new value of `ans` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers, `k` is `k + 1`, `c` is `c + 1`, `ans` is `(ans // arr[l]) % MOD`.**
