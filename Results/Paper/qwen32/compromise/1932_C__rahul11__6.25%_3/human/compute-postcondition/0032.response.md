Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element updated to `ans % m % MOD`, the second element updated to `ans % m % MOD`, and the `c`-th element updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `k` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated to `(ans // arr[l]) % MOD`, `l` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `l` is incremented by 1, while all other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
