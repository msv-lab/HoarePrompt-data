The code snippet `res = [0] * n` initializes the list `res` with `n` elements, all set to 0. This operation does not affect any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `arr` is a new list of integers read from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers where each element is 0, `ans` is the product of the remaining element in `arr` after all other elements have been divided out, modulo `MOD`, `c` is `n`, `l` is `r + 1` (or vice versa), and `r` is `l - 1` (or vice versa)**.
