The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the elements of the list `arr`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` for the next iteration. 

Given that `i` is the next element in `arr` at the start of the loop, and considering that `arr` is a list of integers read from the input with at least one integer, we need to determine the state of `i` at the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the current element of `arr`. For the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in `arr`. Since `arr` has at least one integer, and we are currently processing an element, the next iteration will occur if there are more elements in `arr`.

Let's denote the current index of `i` in `arr` as `current_index`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `arr[current_index]`. For the next iteration, `i` will be `arr[current_index + 1]`.

However, since we are not given the current index explicitly, we can describe the state in terms of the next element of `arr` directly.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `arr` is a new list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 integer, `s` is a new list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers where each element is 0, `ans` is `i * ans`, `c` is `n`, `l` is between 0 and `n-1` depending on the number of 'L' characters, and `r` is between 0 and `n-1` depending on the number of non-'L' characters. `i` is the next element in `arr`.**

Since `i` is the next element in `arr`, and we are not given the specific current index, we can simply state that `i` will be the subsequent element in `arr` for the next iteration. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `arr` is a new list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 integer, `s` is a new list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers where each element is 0, `ans` is `i * ans`, `c` is `n`, `l` is between 0 and `n-1` depending on the number of 'L' characters, and `r` is between 0 and `n-1` depending on the number of non-'L' characters. `i` is the next element in `arr`.**
