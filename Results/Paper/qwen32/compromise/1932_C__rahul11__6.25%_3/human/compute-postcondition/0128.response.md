Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is `ans % m % MOD`, the second element is `ans % m % MOD`, and the third element is `ans % m % MOD`, and the rest are 0. If `s[k]` is 'L', `ans` is the product of all integers in `arr` divided by `arr[0]` modulo `MOD`, `c` is 2, `l` is 1, and `r` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `(ans // arr[r]) % MOD`, `c` is 2, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 2`. `k` is `n - 2`. `ans` is now `(ans // arr[l]) % MOD`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `res[2]` (the third element of `res`) has been updated to `ans % m % MOD`. All other variables retain their previous values.
