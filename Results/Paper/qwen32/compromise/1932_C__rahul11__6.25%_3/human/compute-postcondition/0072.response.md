Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `arr` is a new list of integers read from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is `ans % m % MOD` and the rest are 0, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr`, `c` is 1, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 1`. Additionally, the character at position `k` in `s` is not 'L'**
