Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers, `k` is `k + 1`, `c` is `c + 2`. If `s[k] == 'L'`, then `res[c-1]` is `(ans % m) % MOD` and `ans` is `(ans // arr[l]) % MOD` with `l` incremented by 1. Otherwise, `res[c-1]` is `ans % m % MOD` and `ans` is `(ans // arr[r]) % MOD` with `r` decremented by 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `c` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
