Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the list and `k` is an integer. It returns a list `nums` of length `n` where the first `n-1` elements are all equal to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and the last element is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`.**
