Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string `s` to make it beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map". The program should output the minimum number of characters to remove for each test case.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program does the following:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `a` (which is not used in the program).
3. It reads the string `s`.
4. It counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string `s`.
5. It prints the sum of these counts.

### Reasoning:
The program counts the number of times the substrings "map" and "pie" appear in the string `s`. However, simply counting the occurrences does not give the minimum number of characters to remove to make the string beautiful. This is because removing one character can potentially eliminate multiple occurrences of "map" or "pie" if they overlap.

For example, consider the string "mappie". The program would count one "map" and one "pie", resulting in a total of 2. However, removing just the character 'a' would make the string "mpie", which is still ugly due to "pie". The correct answer here would be 1, as removing one character ('a') is sufficient to make the string beautiful by removing both "map" and "pie".

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly compute the minimum number of characters to remove to make the string beautiful. It only counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" without considering the optimal way to remove characters to eliminate these substrings.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
