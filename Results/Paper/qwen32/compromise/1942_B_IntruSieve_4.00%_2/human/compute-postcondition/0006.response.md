To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables `mex`, `minn`, and `maxx`.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `mex` is initialized as an empty list.
   - `minn` is initialized to 0.
   - `maxx` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Iteration:**
   - The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is the length of the list `arr`.
   - For each element `arr[i]` in the list:
     - If `arr[i] > 0`:
       - Append `minn` to the list `mex`.
       - Increment `minn` by 1.
       - If `minn` equals `maxx`, set `minn` to `maxx + 1`.
     - If `arr[i] <= 0`:
       - Append `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to the list `mex`.
       - If `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than `maxx`, update `maxx` to `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.

### Effect on Variables:
- **`mex`:** This list is populated with values based on the conditions inside the loop. If `arr[i]` is positive, it appends `minn` and increments `minn`. If `arr[i]` is non-positive, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.
- **`minn`:** This variable is incremented each time a positive number is encountered in `arr`. It also resets to `maxx + 1` if it equals `maxx`.
- **`maxx`:** This variable is updated to the maximum value of `abs(arr[i] - minn)` encountered when `arr[i]` is non-positive.

### Output State:
After the loop completes, the state of the variables will be:
- `mex` will contain `n` elements, each determined by the conditions in the loop.
- `minn` will be the final value after all iterations, which could be greater than `maxx` if `minn` was reset.
- `maxx` will be the maximum value of `abs(arr[i] - minn)` encountered when `arr[i]` was non-positive.

### Final Output State:
Given the initial conditions and the behavior of the loop, the final state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`mex` is a list of `n` integers, `minn` is an integer, and `maxx` is an integer reflecting the maximum absolute difference encountered.**
