The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `arr`. The initial state mentions that `n` is the integer input, which indicates the number of elements in the list `a`. After executing the code, the list `arr` will be populated with these integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the integer input; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
