Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to construct the permutation `p` based on the array `a`. The code attempts to calculate the `mex` values but does not correctly map the values of `a` to the corresponding permutation `p`.

Let's examine the logic in the code:

1. The code reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
3. It initializes `mex` as an empty list and `minn` and `maxx` as 0.
4. It iterates through the array `a`:
   - If `a[i]` is positive, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`.
   - If `a[i]` is non-positive, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`.
5. Finally, it prints the `mex` list as the permutation `p`.

### Issues in the Code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `mex`**: The `mex` value is not correctly calculated. The `mex` value should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current prefix of `p`. The code does not maintain a set of used numbers to determine the `mex` value correctly.
2. **Incorrect Handling of Negative Values**: The code incorrectly calculates the value to append to `mex` when `a[i]` is non-positive. It should be based on the current `mex` value and the value of `a[i]`, but the logic is flawed.
3. **No Proper Set Management**: The code does not maintain a set of numbers that have already been used in the permutation `p`, which is necessary to correctly calculate the `mex` value.

### Counterexample:

Let's consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

**Code Output:**
```
0 1 2 3 4
```

In this example, the code does not correctly construct the permutation `p` that satisfies the given array `a`. The output `0 1 2 3 4` does not match the expected output `0 1 4 2 3` because the `mex` values are not calculated correctly.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.
