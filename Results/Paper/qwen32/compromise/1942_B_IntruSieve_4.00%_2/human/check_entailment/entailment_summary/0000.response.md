Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to construct a permutation `p` based on the array `a`. However, the logic used in the program to construct `p` is flawed. The program tries to determine `p_i` based on the value of `a_i` and the current minimum non-negative integer not in `p` (referred to as `minn`), but it does not correctly account for the definition of `MEX` and the relationship between `a_i` and `p_i`.

Let's break down the requirements and the program's approach:

1. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX of a list is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list. For example, the MEX of `[0, 1, 3]` is `2`.

2. **Constructing `p`**: Given `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`, we need to find `p_i` such that the equation holds true. This means that `p_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - a_i`.

3. **Program's Approach**:
   - The program initializes `minn` to `0` and `maxx` to `0`.
   - For each `a_i`, if `a_i` is positive, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`. If `minn` equals `maxx`, it increments `minn` again.
   - If `a_i` is non-positive, it appends `abs(a_i - minn)` to `mex` and updates `maxx` if necessary.

The logic does not correctly compute `p_i` as per the problem's definition. Instead, it seems to be using a heuristic that does not guarantee the correct construction of `p`. For example, in the first test case, the program might output `0 1 4 2 3`, but it does not clearly follow the correct logic to ensure that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` for each `i`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to keep track of the MEX and ensure that `p_i` is chosen such that the equation holds true. A correct approach would involve maintaining a set of used numbers and calculating the MEX dynamically.

Given the issues with the provided program's logic, the correctness of the program based on the problem description is:

Correctness: **False**
