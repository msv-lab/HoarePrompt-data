### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to check if a password meets the criteria for being strong as defined in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the program's logic and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through each test case, extracting the password length `n` and the password string itself.

2. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for checking if a given password meets all the conditions for being strong:
     - **Condition 1:** The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. This condition is implicitly satisfied by the problem constraints, so no explicit check is needed.
     - **Condition 2:** There should be no digit that comes after a letter. This is checked by iterating through the password and keeping track of the last index of a digit encountered. If a letter is found after this index, the function returns "NO".
     - **Condition 3:** All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order. This is verified by comparing the list of digits with its sorted version.
     - **Condition 4:** All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order. This is verified by comparing the list of letters with its sorted version.
     
3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the function returns "YES" if the password meets all conditions, otherwise "NO". The results are collected in a list and printed at the end.

### Verification:
- The program correctly checks each of the conditions specified in the problem statement.
- The use of `sorted()` to verify the order of digits and letters ensures that the non-decreasing order requirement is met.
- The check for the order of digits and letters relative to each other ensures that no digit appears after a letter in the password.

### Conclusion:
Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if a password is strong based on the provided conditions.

### Your response:
Correctness: **True**
