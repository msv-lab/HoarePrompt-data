Let's analyze the problem, the provided code, and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to verify if a password is strong based on the following conditions:
1. The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Provided Code Analysis:
The code reads multiple test cases and checks each password using the `func_1` function. The `func_1` function separates the password into digits and letters, checks if any digit appears after a letter, and verifies if the digits and letters are in non-decreasing order.

### Function Summary:
The function summary correctly states that the function checks if all digits appear before any letters and that both digits and letters are in non-decreasing order.

### Original Assessment:
The original assessment claims that the provided program is incorrect because it does not explicitly check if the digits and letters are sorted when they are the only characters in the password. However, the code implicitly handles these cases because the `sorted` function will return the same list if the list is already sorted, and the conditions for digits coming after letters are not violated in these cases.

### Detailed Reasoning:
1. **Password with only digits**: If the password consists only of digits, the `digits` list will contain all characters, and the `letters` list will be empty. The condition `if digits != sorted(digits)` will correctly check if the digits are sorted.
2. **Password with only letters**: If the password consists only of letters, the `letters` list will contain all characters, and the `digits` list will be empty. The condition `if letters != sorted(letters)` will correctly check if the letters are sorted.
3. **Password with only digits but not sorted**: The condition `if digits != sorted(digits)` will correctly return "NO" because the digits are not in non-decreasing order.
4. **Password with only letters but not sorted**: The condition `if letters != sorted(letters)` will correctly return "NO" because the letters are not in non-decreasing order.
5. **Password with digits followed by letters**: The code correctly checks if any letter appears after a digit and ensures that both digits and letters are in non-decreasing order.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the code does correctly handle passwords consisting only of digits or only of letters. The conditions `if digits != sorted(digits)` and `if letters != sorted(letters)` ensure that the digits and letters are sorted when they are present in the password. The code also correctly checks that no digit appears after a letter.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
