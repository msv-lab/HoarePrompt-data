Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers where `2 <= len(a) <= 100` and `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` for all `i`. `num2` is an integer representing the length of the list `a` such that `num2 == len(a)`. If `a[i - 1] >= a[i]`, then `order` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `order` remains unchanged. `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**
