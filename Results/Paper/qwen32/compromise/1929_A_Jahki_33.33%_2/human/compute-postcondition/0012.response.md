Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers where `2 <= len(a) <= 100` and `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` for all `i`. `num2` is an integer representing the length of the list `a` such that `num2 == len(a)`. The current value of `order` is 0, indicating that no element in `a` is greater than or equal to the next element in the list.**
