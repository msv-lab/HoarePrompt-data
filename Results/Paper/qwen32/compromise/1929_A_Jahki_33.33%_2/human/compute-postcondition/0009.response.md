Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where `2 <= len(a) <= 100` and `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` for all `i`. `num2` is an integer representing the length of the list `a` such that `num2 == len(a)`. `order` is incremented by 1. `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**

In simple terms, the value of `order` has been increased by 1, and the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. All other conditions and values remain the same.
