The code snippet `order += 1` increments the value of the variable `order` by 1. Therefore, the value of `order` will be one more than its previous value. The other variables (`a`, `num2`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where `2 <= len(a) <= 100` and `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` for all `i`. `num2` is an integer representing the length of the list `a` such that `num2 == len(a)`. If `a[i - 1] >= a[i]`, then `order` is 1; otherwise, `order` remains 0. `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. `order` is incremented by 1.**
