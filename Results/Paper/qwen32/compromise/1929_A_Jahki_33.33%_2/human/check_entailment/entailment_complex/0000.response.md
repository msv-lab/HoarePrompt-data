### Reasoning:

The program is intended to calculate the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The program sorts the array `a` to maximize the beauty. The beauty of the array is maximized when the array is sorted in ascending order because the differences between consecutive elements will be maximized.

3. **Calculating Beauty:**
   - The program calculates the beauty of the sorted array by iterating through the array and summing up the differences between consecutive elements.

4. **Checking for Already Sorted Array:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already strictly increasing. If it is, the beauty is 0 because no rearrangement can increase the beauty further.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Use of `func_1`:** The function `func_1` is supposed to determine if the array is strictly increasing. However, the program only prints `0` if the array is strictly increasing, which is incorrect. The beauty should still be calculated even if the array is strictly increasing because the maximum beauty is the sum of differences in the sorted array, not necessarily `0`.
- **Logic Error:** The program incorrectly assumes that if the array is already strictly increasing, the beauty is `0`. This is not correct. The beauty should be calculated regardless of the initial order of the array.

### Correctness:
Given the issues described, the program is not correct because it incorrectly handles the case where the array is already strictly increasing. The beauty should be calculated based on the sorted array, not based on whether the array is strictly increasing or not.

### Correctness: **False**
