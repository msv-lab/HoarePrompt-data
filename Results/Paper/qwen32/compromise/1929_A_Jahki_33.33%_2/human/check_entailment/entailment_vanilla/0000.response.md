Let's break down the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. The beauty is calculated as:
\[ \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \]

To maximize this sum, the optimal strategy is to sort the array in ascending order, as this will maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the elements of the array.

2. **Sorting and Calculation:**
   - The array is sorted in ascending order.
   - The beauty is calculated by summing up the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Output:**
   - If the array is already sorted (`func_1(a, num2)` returns `True`), the program outputs `0`, which is incorrect as it should compute the beauty even if the array is sorted.
   - Otherwise, it calculates and outputs the beauty as described.

### Issues in the Program:
- The function `func_1` is unnecessary for the problem. The beauty should always be calculated regardless of whether the array is sorted or not.
- The condition `if func_1(a, num2): print(0)` is incorrect. The beauty should be calculated and printed in all cases.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the program, we should remove the unnecessary function `func_1` and always compute the beauty.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the unnecessary check and incorrect handling of already sorted arrays.

Correctness: **False**
