You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    if func_1(a, num2):
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)

def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
    if order == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Function Summary: 
The function checks if a list of integers `a` is strictly increasing. It returns `True` if every element in the list is less than the next element, and `False` otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains a logical error in the `func_1` function and the way it handles the calculation of beauty. 

The `func_1` function is supposed to check if the array is already in non-decreasing order. If it is, the function returns `True`, and the program incorrectly outputs `0` for the beauty. However, the beauty should be calculated even if the array is already in non-decreasing order.

Additionally, the logic in the `func_1` function is flawed because it checks for non-decreasing order but returns `True` (indicating no need to calculate beauty) when the array is in non-decreasing order, which is incorrect. The beauty should always be calculated regardless of the initial order of the array.

Here is a specific case where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
Expected Output:
```
2
```
Actual Output:
```
0
```

In this case, the array is already in non-decreasing order, but the beauty should still be calculated as `(2-1) + (3-2) = 2`. However, the program incorrectly outputs `0` because the `func_1` function returns `True`.

To fix the program, the `func_1` function should be removed, and the beauty should always be calculated by sorting the array and summing the differences between consecutive elements.
