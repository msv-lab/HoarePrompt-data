Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because of the logic in the `func_1` function. The `func_1` function is intended to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, but the logic is inverted. If the array is already sorted, `func_1` should return `False` (indicating no need to rearrange), but it returns `True`. As a result, the program incorrectly prints `0` for arrays that are already sorted in non-decreasing order. 

The correct logic for `func_1` should be:

```python
def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
            order += 1
    return order == 0
```

However, this function is not actually needed since the program can simply sort the array and compute the beauty directly without checking if it's already sorted. The `func_1` function can be removed, and the program will still work correctly. Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    beauty = 0
    b = sorted(a)
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
    print(beauty)
```

This version of the program will correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and summing the differences between consecutive elements.
