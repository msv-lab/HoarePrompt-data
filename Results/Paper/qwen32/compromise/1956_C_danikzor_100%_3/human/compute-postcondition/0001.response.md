To determine what will be printed in the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the code step by step based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n` is an integer representing the size of an `n` × `n` matrix filled with zeroes.
- `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, meaning it will be provided by the user.
- The code snippet will compute and print two values: `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` and `2 * n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The value of `n` is provided by the user and is an integer between 1 and 500, inclusive.

2. **First Expression: `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`**
   - This expression calculates a specific value based on the input `n`.
   - It is a formula often used in combinatorics, specifically for calculating the sum of squares of the first `n` natural numbers.
   - The formula is: \(\frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6}\), but in this case, it is slightly modified to \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\).

3. **Second Expression: `2 * n`**
   - This expression simply doubles the value of `n`.

### Output:
- The `print` statement will output the result of the first expression followed by the result of the second expression, separated by a space.

### Final Output Description:
- The first value printed is the result of the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`.
- The second value printed is `2 * n`.

### Example:
If `n` is 3:
- First expression: \(3 * (3 + 1) * (4 * 3 - 1) // 6 = 3 * 4 * 11 // 6 = 132 // 6 = 22\)
- Second expression: \(2 * 3 = 6\)
- Output: **22 6**

### General Output:
Given the general `n`, the output will be the result of the formula followed by `2 * n`.

Output: **n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n (where n is the integer input representing the size of the n × n matrix)**
