Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. There are two types of operations:
1. Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and assign a permutation \( p \) to it.
2. Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and assign a permutation \( p \) to it.

The sum of all elements in the matrix should be maximized, and the sum of \( n^2 \) over all test cases does not exceed \( 5 \times 10^5 \).

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling the `func_1` function. Here is a detailed breakdown of `func_1`:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The function reads the integer \( n \) which is the size of the matrix.

2. **Output Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix elements and the number of operations.
     - The formula used for the maximum sum is \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \).
     - The number of operations is \( 2n \).

3. **Operations Generation:**
   - For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \):
     - Perform a Type 1 operation on row \( i \) using the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
     - Perform a Type 2 operation on column \( i \) using the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

### Verification:
- **Maximum Sum Calculation:**
  The formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \) is the sum of the first \( n^2 \) natural numbers, which is indeed the maximum sum achievable if each element in the matrix is distinct and ranges from 1 to \( n^2 \).

- **Operations Generation:**
  - The operations are designed to fill the matrix with distinct values from 1 to \( n^2 \).
  - By assigning the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \) to each row and then each column, the matrix will be filled such that each row and each column contains distinct values from 1 to \( n \).
  - This ensures that the matrix will be filled with the first \( n^2 \) natural numbers, achieving the maximum sum.

- **Number of Operations:**
  - The program performs exactly \( 2n \) operations (one Type 1 and one Type 2 for each row/column), which meets the requirement of using no more than \( 2n \) operations.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and generates the required operations to achieve this sum within the constraints provided.

Correctness: **True**
