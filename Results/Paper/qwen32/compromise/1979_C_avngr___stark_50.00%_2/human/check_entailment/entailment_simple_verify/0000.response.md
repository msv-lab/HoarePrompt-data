### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated version to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Program Overview**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes (`n`) and the multipliers (`k`).
   - It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers (`m`).
   - It then calculates the bets as `m / k[i]` and divides these bets by their GCD to reduce their size.
   - It checks if the sum of these bets is less than the reduced LCM divided by the GCD. If not, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the bets.

2. **Key Points from the Annotated Code**:
   - The LCM (`m`) of the multipliers is correctly calculated.
   - The bets are calculated as `m / k[i]`.
   - The GCD of the bets is calculated and used to reduce the bets.
   - The condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf:` checks if the total sum of the bets is less than the reduced LCM.

3. **Issues in the Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment claims that the condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf:` is incorrect because it does not ensure that `sum(c) < k[i] * c[i]` for all `i`.
   - However, the condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf:` is actually correct in the context of the problem. Here's why:
     - The bets are calculated as `m / k[i]`. This means that for any winning outcome `i`, the amount received back is `k[i] * (m / k[i]) = m`.
     - The total sum of the bets is `sum(m / k[i])`. The condition `sum(c) < m / hcf` ensures that the total sum of the bets is strictly less than the amount received in any winning scenario (which is `m`).

4. **Verification with Examples**:
   - **Example 1**:
     ```
     1
     3
     3 2 7
     ```
     - LCM (`m`) of `[3, 2, 7]` is `42`.
     - Bets are `[14, 21, 6]` (since `42 / 3 = 14`, `42 / 2 = 21`, `42 / 7 = 6`).
     - GCD of `[14, 21, 6]` is `1`.
     - Reduced bets are `[14, 21, 6]`.
     - Sum of bets is `41`, which is less than `42 / 1 = 42`.
     - The output is `14 21 6`, which is correct.

   - **Example 2**:
     ```
     1
     3
     2 2 2
     ```
     - LCM (`m`) of `[2, 2, 2]` is `2`.
     - Bets are `[1, 1, 1]` (since `2 / 2 = 1` for each `k[i]`).
     - GCD of `[1, 1, 1]` is `1`.
     - Reduced bets are `[1, 1, 1]`.
     - Sum of bets is `3`, which is not less than `2 / 1 = 2`.
     - The output is `-1`, which is correct.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment incorrectly claims that the condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf:` is incorrect.
   - The provided code correctly implements the logic to ensure that the total sum of the bets is strictly less than the amount received in any winning scenario.
