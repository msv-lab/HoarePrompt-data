You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

- Program:
from math import gcd

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    m = 1
    for i in range(n):
        m = m * k[i]
    c = []
    for i in range(n):
        c.append(int(m / k[i]))
    hcf = func_1(c)
    for i in range(n):
        c[i] = int(c[i] / hcf)
    if sum(c) >= m / hcf:
        print(-1)
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            print(c[i], end=' ')
        print('')

def func_1(numbers):
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
    return hcf



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `numbers` where the first element `t` indicates the number of test cases. The subsequent elements are integers representing multipliers for each test case. The function returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these multiplier integers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine how to distribute the coins such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. This means, for each outcome \(i\), the sum of all bets \( \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j \) must be less than \( k_i \times x_i \).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`.

2. **Calculating `m`:**
   - `m` is calculated as the product of all multipliers `k`. This represents the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers if they were all distinct primes, but in general, it's just the product.

3. **Calculating `c`:**
   - `c` is a list where each element `c[i]` is calculated as `m / k[i]`. This essentially computes the LCM of all multipliers except `k[i]`.

4. **Finding the HCF of `c`:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the highest common factor (HCF) of the elements in `c`.

5. **Normalizing `c`:**
   - Each element in `c` is divided by the HCF of `c` to normalize the values.

6. **Checking the Condition:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the normalized `c` is less than `m / hcf`. If not, it prints `-1`.
   - If the condition is satisfied, it prints the normalized `c` values.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Conceptual Correctness:**
  - The idea behind the solution is to find a set of bets `x_i` such that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome. The program uses the product of the multipliers and divides it by each multiplier to distribute the bets in a way that satisfies the condition.
  - The normalization step ensures that the bets are as small as possible while still satisfying the condition.

- **Implementation Details:**
  - The program correctly calculates the product of the multipliers.
  - It computes the LCM of all multipliers except the current one for each outcome.
  - The HCF of these values is used to normalize the bets, ensuring that they are integers and as small as possible.
  - The condition `sum(c) < m / hcf` ensures that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If all multipliers are the same, the program will return `-1` because the sum of bets cannot be less than the return for any outcome.
  - If the multipliers are distinct, the program will find a valid distribution of bets.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find a valid distribution of bets or determine that no such distribution exists. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
