Postcondition: **`rev_res` is the concatenation of all substrings from `operational_list` that maintain the same length when reversed, followed by the processed elements from `rev_val` according to the loop's logic. `t`, `y`, `list_len`, `max_power`, and `operational_list` remain unchanged. If `10 ** int(max_power) < int(rev_res)`, then `rev_res` is in a state where its integer value exceeds `10 ** int(max_power)`. Otherwise, `rev_res` is in a state where its integer value does not exceed `10 ** int(max_power)`.**
