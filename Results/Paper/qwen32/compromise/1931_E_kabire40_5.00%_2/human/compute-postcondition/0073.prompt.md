Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input, `rev_res` is an empty string, `rev_val` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for x in operational_list:
    x_rev = int(x[::-1])
    if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
        rev_res = rev_res + x
    else:
        rev_val.append(x[::-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input that must have at least 1 substring, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the first element of `operational_list`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is the string representation of `x_rev` and `rev_val` is an empty list. Otherwise, `rev_res` is an empty string and `rev_val` is a list containing the first element of `operational_list`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input that must have at least 2 substrings, `x` is the second element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`. If the length of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is the string representation of `x_rev` and `rev_val` is an empty list. Otherwise, `rev_res` is an empty string and `rev_val` is a list containing the second element of `operational_list` and the reverse of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input that must have at least 3 substrings, `x` is the third element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`. If the length of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is the string representation of `x_rev`, otherwise `rev_res` is an empty string. `rev_val` is a list containing the third element of `operational_list` and the reverse of `x` if the length of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of `x`. If the length of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of `x`, the reverse of `x` is appended to `rev_val`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
