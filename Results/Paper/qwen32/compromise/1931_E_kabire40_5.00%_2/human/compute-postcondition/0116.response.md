The code snippet `rev_val.append(x[::-1])` takes the string `x`, reverses it, and appends the reversed string to the list `rev_val`. 

Given the initial state:
- `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the string `x`
- `operational_list` must have at least one more element
- `x` is the next element in `operational_list`

The variable `x` is a string, and `x[::-1]` creates a new string that is the reverse of `x`. This reversed string is then appended to the list `rev_val`.

The values of `x_rev` and the elements of `operational_list` remain unchanged. The only change is that `rev_val` now contains an additional element, which is the reverse of `x`.

Output State: **`x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the string `x`, `operational_list` must have at least one more element, `x` is the next element in `operational_list`, `rev_val` has an additional element which is the reverse of `x`.**
