Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is unchanged, `y` is 2, `list_len` is unchanged, `max_power` is unchanged, `operational_list` is unchanged, `rev_res` is the concatenation of all substrings from `operational_list` that maintain the same length when reversed, `rev_val` is a list of reversed strings of all substrings from `operational_list` that do not maintain the same length when reversed, sorted in ascending order.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(len(rev_val)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        val_in = int(rev_val[x])
        rev_res += str(val_in)
    else:
        val_in = rev_val[x]
        rev_res += val_in[::-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is unchanged, `y` is 2, `list_len` is unchanged, `max_power` is unchanged, `operational_list` is unchanged, `rev_res` is the concatenation of all substrings from `operational_list` that maintain the same length when reversed, followed by either the string representation of `val_in` if `x` is even, or the original string at index `x` of `rev_val` if `x` is odd. `rev_val` is a list of reversed strings of all substrings from `operational_list` that do not maintain the same length when reversed, sorted in ascending order, and `rev_val` must have at least one element. `val_in` is an integer representation of the `x`-th element of `rev_val` if `x` is even, or the element at index `x` of `rev_val` if `x` is odd.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is unchanged, `y` is 2, `list_len` is unchanged, `max_power` is unchanged, `operational_list` is unchanged, `rev_val` is a list of reversed strings of all substrings from `operational_list` that do not maintain the same length when reversed, sorted in ascending order, and `rev_val` must have at least one element, `x` is 3, `len(rev_val)` must be greater than 3. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is the concatenation of all substrings from `operational_list` that maintain the same length when reversed, followed by the original string at index 3 of `rev_val`, and then the string representation of `val_in`. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is the concatenation of all substrings from `operational_list` that maintain the same length when reversed, followed by the original string at index 3 of `rev_val` and then the reverse of the string at index 3 of `rev_val`. `val_in` is the integer representation of the string at index 3 of `rev_val` if `x` is even, or the element at index 3 of `rev_val` if `x` is odd.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is unchanged, `y` is 2, `list_len` is unchanged, `max_power` is unchanged, `operational_list` is unchanged, `rev_val` is a list of reversed strings of all substrings from `operational_list` that do not maintain the same length when reversed, sorted in ascending order, and `rev_val` must have at least one element, `x` is 4, `len(rev_val)` must be greater than 4. If `x % 2 == 0`, then `val_in` is the integer value of `rev_val[4]` and `rev_res` is updated to its previous value concatenated with the string representation of `val_in`. Otherwise, `val_in` is `rev_val[4]` and `rev_res` includes the reversed string of `rev_val[4]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
