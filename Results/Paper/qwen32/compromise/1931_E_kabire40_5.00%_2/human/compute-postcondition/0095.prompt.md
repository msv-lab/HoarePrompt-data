Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input, `rev_res` is a concatenation of all original strings `x` from `operational_list` where the reversed string `x_rev` has the same length as `x`, and `rev_val` is a sorted list of all reversed strings `x_rev` from `operational_list` where the length of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of `x`.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(len(rev_val)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        val_in = int(rev_val[x])
        rev_res += str(val_in)
    else:
        val_in = rev_val[x]
        rev_res += val_in[::-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input, `rev_res` is a concatenation of all original strings `x` from `operational_list` where the reversed string `x_rev` has the same length as `x`, plus either the string representation of `val_in` if `x` is even, or the reverse of `val_in` if `x` is odd, `rev_val` is a sorted list of all reversed strings `x_rev` from `operational_list` where the length of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of `x` and must have at least one element, `x` is an integer, `val_in` is either the integer value of the `x`-th element of `rev_val` if `x` is even, or the value at index `x` of `rev_val` if `x` is odd.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input, `rev_res` is a concatenation of all original strings `x` from `operational_list` where the reversed string `x_rev` has the same length as `x`, plus either the string representation of `val_in` if `x` is even, or the reverse of `val_in` if `x` is odd, plus the string representation of `val_in` if `x` is even, or the reverse of the string at index `x` of `rev_val` if `x` is odd, `rev_val` is a sorted list of all reversed strings `x_rev` from `operational_list` where the length of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of `x` and must have at least one element, `x` is `x + 1`, `val_in` is the integer value of the `x`-th element of `rev_val` if `x` is even, or the value at index `x` of `rev_val` if `x` is odd.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input, `rev_res` is a concatenation of all original strings `x` from `operational_list` where the reversed string `x_rev` has the same length as `x`, plus either the string representation of `val_in` if `x` is even, or the reverse of `val_in` if `x` is odd, plus the string representation of `val_in` if `x` is even, or the reverse of the string at index `x` of `rev_val` if `x` is odd, plus `str(val_in)` if `x` is even, or the reverse of `val_in` if `x` is odd, `rev_val` is a sorted list of all reversed strings `x_rev` from `operational_list` where the length of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of `x` and must have at least one element, `x` is `x + 1`, `val_in` is the integer value of the `x`-th element of `rev_val` if `x` is even, or the value at index `x` of `rev_val` if `x` is odd.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
