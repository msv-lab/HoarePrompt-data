Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6. The list a contains n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(int(input())):
    rev_val = []
    rev_res = ''
    list_len, max_power = input().split()
    operational_list = input().split()
    for x in operational_list:
        x_rev = int(x[::-1])
        if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
            rev_res = rev_res + x
        else:
            rev_val.append(x[::-1])
    rev_val.sort()
    for x in range(len(rev_val)):
        if x % 2 == 0:
            val_in = int(rev_val[x])
            rev_res += str(val_in)
        else:
            val_in = rev_val[x]
            rev_res += val_in[::-1]
    if 10 ** int(max_power) < int(rev_res):
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Anna')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 0, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input, `rev_res` is the concatenated string of all substrings from `operational_list` that, when reversed, have the same length as the original substring, followed by either the string representation of `val_in` if `x` is even, or the reverse of `val_in` if `x` is odd for each `x` in the range of the length of `rev_val`, `rev_val` is a list of all reversed substrings from `operational_list` that do not meet the length criteria, `rev_val` is sorted. If `rev_res` is greater than 10 raised to the power of `max_power`, the value of `rev_res` is greater than 10 raised to the power of `max_power`. Otherwise, `rev_res` is not greater than 10 raised to the power of `max_power`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input, `rev_res` is a concatenation of all original strings `x` from `operational_list` where `x` is equal to its reverse, plus the integer value of `rev_val[x]` if `x` is even, or the reverse of `rev_val[x]` if `x` is odd, for all `x` in the range of `len(rev_val)`, `rev_val` is a sorted list of all reversed strings `x_rev` from `operational_list` where the length of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of `x`. If `10

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `rev_res` is the concatenation of all substrings from `operational_list` that maintain the same length when reversed, followed by the processed elements from `rev_val` according to the loop's logic. `t`, `y`, `list_len`, `max_power`, and `operational_list` remain unchanged. If `10




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
