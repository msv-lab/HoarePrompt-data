The code snippet `x_rev = int(x[::-1])` reverses the string `x` and converts it to an integer, assigning this integer value to `x_rev`. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly dependent on `x_rev`.

Given the initial state, `x` is the second substring in `operational_list`, and `x_rev` is the integer value of `x` reversed. The code snippet updates `x_rev` but does not affect the conditions or values of `rev_res` and `rev_val` directly. The conditions for `rev_res` and `rev_val` will be evaluated based on the new value of `x_rev`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 0, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input that must have at least 1 substring, `x` is the second substring in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the new `x` reversed. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the new `x`, then `rev_res` is the string representation of the new `x` and `rev_val` is an empty list. Otherwise, `rev_res` is an empty string and `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of the new `x` as a string.**
