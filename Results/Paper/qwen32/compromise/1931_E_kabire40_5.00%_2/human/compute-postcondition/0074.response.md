The code snippet `rev_val.sort()` sorts the list `rev_val` in ascending order. The other variables (`t`, `y`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `operational_list`, and `rev_res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input, `rev_res` is a concatenation of all original strings `x` from `operational_list` where the reversed string `x_rev` has the same length as `x`, and `rev_val` is a sorted list of all reversed strings `x_rev` from `operational_list` where the length of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of `x`.**
