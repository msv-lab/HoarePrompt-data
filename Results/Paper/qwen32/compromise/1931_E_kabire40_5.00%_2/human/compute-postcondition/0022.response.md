To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's analyze the loop's behavior:

The loop iterates over each substring `x` in `operational_list`. For each substring:
1. It reverses the substring `x` and converts it to an integer `x_rev`.
2. It checks if the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the original substring `x`.
3. If they are equal, it appends `x` to `rev_res`.
4. If they are not equal, it appends the reversed string `x[::-1]` to `rev_val`.

After the loop completes, `rev_res` will contain all substrings that, when reversed, have the same length as the original substring, concatenated together. `rev_val` will contain all reversed substrings that do not meet the length criteria.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the final output state can be described as follows:

- `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
- `y` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
- `list_len` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
- `max_power` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
- `operational_list` remains unchanged as it is only iterated over, not modified.
- `rev_res` will contain the concatenated string of all substrings from `operational_list` that, when reversed, have the same length as the original substring.
- `rev_val` will contain a list of all reversed substrings from `operational_list` that do not meet the length criteria.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 0, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input, `rev_res` is the concatenated string of all substrings from `operational_list` that, when reversed, have the same length as the original substring, `rev_val` is a list of all reversed substrings from `operational_list` that do not meet the length criteria.**
