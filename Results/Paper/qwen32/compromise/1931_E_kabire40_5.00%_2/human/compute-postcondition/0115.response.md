The code snippet provided adds the value of `x` to `rev_res`. Given the initial state, `x` is the next element in `operational_list` and `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the string `x`. Since `rev_res` is not defined in the initial state, we will assume it has been defined previously and holds some integer value.

After executing the code, `rev_res` will be updated to its previous value plus the value of `x`.

Output State: **`x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the string `x`, `operational_list` must have at least one more element, `x` is the next element in `operational_list`, `rev_res` is the previous value of `rev_res` plus `x`.**
