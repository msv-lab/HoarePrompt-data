The code snippet reads two values from the input, splits them, and assigns them to `list_len` and `max_power`. The initial state of `t`, `y`, `rev_val`, and `rev_res` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 0, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input.**
