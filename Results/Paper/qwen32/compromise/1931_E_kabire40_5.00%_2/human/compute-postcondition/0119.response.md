The code snippet `x_rev = int(x[::-1])` takes the string `x`, reverses it, and converts the reversed string back to an integer, which is then assigned to `x_rev`.

Given the initial state, `x` is the next element in `operational_list`. After executing the code, `x_rev` will hold the integer value of the reversed string `x`.

Output State: **`x` is the next element in `operational_list`; `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`.**
