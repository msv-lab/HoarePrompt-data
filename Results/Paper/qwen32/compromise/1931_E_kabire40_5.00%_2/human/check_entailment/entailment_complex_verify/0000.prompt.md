You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

    1 2 9 10 10 2 10 2
    
    4 5
    
    10 10 10 10

Output

    Sasha
    Anna
    Anna
    Sasha
    Sasha
    Anna
    Anna
    Anna
    Sasha
    
Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

    #State: a series of "Sasha" or "Anna" for each of the t test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it performs operations on the list `a` involving reversing integers and sorting. Based on the results of these operations and the value of `m`, it prints either "Sasha" or "Anna".


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules and logic described in the problem statement. Here are some issues:

1. **Anna's Turn Handling**:
   - The program does not correctly handle Anna's turn where she reverses the digits of an element in the list. It only reverses the digits of the elements and appends them to `rev_res` if the length of the reversed number is the same as the original number. This is incorrect because Anna can choose any element to reverse, and there is no requirement that the length of the reversed number should be the same as the original number.

2. **Sasha's Turn Handling**:
   - Sasha's turn is not correctly handled. He should concatenate two elements in any order and insert the result back into the list. The program does not simulate this process. Instead, it concatenates all the reversed numbers and checks if the result is greater than 10^m.

3. **Optimal Play**:
   - The program does not simulate the optimal play of both players. It does not consider the strategic choices that Sasha and Anna would make to win the game. The program simply concatenates the reversed numbers and checks the result, which does not reflect the actual game mechanics.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if the list has only one element, the game should end immediately after Anna's turn, and Sasha should not be able to make a move.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 5
9 56 1
```
- Anna can reverse the number 9 to 9.
- Sasha can then concatenate 56 and 1 to form 561, and the list becomes [9, 561].
- Anna can reverse 9 to 9.
- Sasha can then concatenate 9 and 561 to form 9561 or 5619, both of which are greater than 10^5. So Sasha wins.

However, the program will not correctly simulate this process and may incorrectly determine the winner.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.
