arr is a list of strings where each string consists of characters '<' and '>', and times is a list of integers representing the lengths of the corresponding strings in arr, such that for each index i, times[i] is the length of arr[i] and 1 <= times[i] <= 5 * 10^5. The total length of all strings in arr does not exceed 5 * 10^5.
