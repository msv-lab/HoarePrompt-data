Let's analyze the problem description and the provided program to determine if the original assessment is correct.

### Problem Analysis
Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\). He can make a cut parallel to one of the sides to form two smaller rectangles. These two smaller rectangles can then be rearranged to form another rectangle. The task is to determine if it's possible to form a different rectangle from the original one.

### Key Observations
- If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.
  - If \(a\) is even, we can cut the rectangle into two \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) rectangles.
  - If \(b\) is even, we can cut the rectangle into two \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \) rectangles.
- If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the only possible cuts result in two \(1 \times b\) or \(a \times 1\) rectangles, which cannot form a different rectangle when rearranged.

### Program Analysis
The provided code checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If either is even, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Annotated Code Review
The annotations correctly describe the program's behavior:
- The program reads an integer \(t\) representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\).
- It then checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If so, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Validation Against Problem Description
The logic in the code aligns with the problem description:
- If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, the program correctly determines that it is possible to form a different rectangle.
- If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the program correctly determines that it is not possible to form a different rectangle.

### Handling Edge Cases
The program handles edge cases correctly:
- When \(a\) or \(b\) is 1 (an odd number), the program correctly prints "No" unless the other dimension is even.
- When both \(a\) and \(b\) are greater than 1 and both are odd, the program correctly prints "No".

### Conclusion
The original assessment is correct. The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
