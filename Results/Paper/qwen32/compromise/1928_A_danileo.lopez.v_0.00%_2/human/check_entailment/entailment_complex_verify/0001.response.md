### Reasoning:

To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's re-examine the problem description and the logic implemented in the code, using the annotated version to guide our evaluation.

**Problem Analysis:**
- Bob has a rectangle of dimensions `a x b`.
- He can cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
- These two smaller rectangles should be rearranged to form a new rectangle that is different from the original rectangle (considering rotations as identical).

**Key Observations:**
- If either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle:
  - If `a` is even, he can cut the rectangle into two `a/2 x b` rectangles.
  - If `b` is even, he can cut the rectangle into two `a x b/2` rectangles.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, any cut will result in two rectangles with dimensions that cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions:
  - Cutting along `a` will result in two rectangles of dimensions `a x (b-1)/2`.
  - Cutting along `b` will result in two rectangles of dimensions `(a-1)/2 x b`.
  - These dimensions cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle that is different from the original `a x b` rectangle.

**Program Analysis:**
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b`.
- It checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If so, it prints "Yes", indicating that another rectangle can be formed.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints "No".

**Annotations:**
- The annotated version confirms that the program correctly checks the conditions and outputs "Yes" if either `a` or `b` is even, and "No" if both are odd.

**Validation:**
- The annotations match the logic described in the original assessment.
- The program correctly handles the edge cases mentioned in the problem statement.

**Conclusion:**
- The logic in the program correctly determines whether another rectangle can be formed based on the observations and the problem description.
- The program handles all edge cases as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
