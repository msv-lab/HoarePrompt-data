Let's analyze the problem, the provided code, and the function summary to validate the correctness of the program.

### Problem Analysis
Bob can form another rectangle from his rectangle of size `a x b` if he can cut it into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a different rectangle. The key observation is that if either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a different rectangle. If both `a` and `b` are odd, the only possible cuts result in two `1 x b` or `a x 1` rectangles, which cannot form a different rectangle when rearranged.

### Code Analysis
The provided code reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It checks if either `a` or `b` is even:
- If either `a` or `b` is even, it prints "Yes".
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints "No".

### Function Summary
The function summary correctly describes the behavior of the function. It states that the function outputs 'Yes' if either `a` or `b` is even, and 'No' if both `a` and `b` are odd.

### Evaluation of Original Assessment
The original assessment is correct. The logic in the code is sound and handles all edge cases:
- If `a` is even, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles of dimensions `a/2 x b` and `a/2 x b`, which can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.
- If `b` is even, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles of dimensions `a x b/2` and `a x b/2`, which can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, the only possible cuts result in two `1 x b` or `a x 1` rectangles, which cannot form a different rectangle when rearranged.

The provided examples in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program, and there are no edge cases that the program fails to address.

### Final Evaluation
Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
