The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then outputs 'Yes' if either `a` or `b` (or both) is even, and 'No' if both `a` and `b` are odd. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged after the function executes.
