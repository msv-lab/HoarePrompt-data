The code snippet `c0 += coef0[j]` updates the variable `c0` by adding the value of `coef0[j]` to it. Given that `j` is 3, `c0` is updated to `c0 + coef0[3]`. Since `c0` was initially defined as `2 * coef0[j]` and `j` was 2, `c0` was `2 * coef0[2]`. After the update, `c0` becomes `2 * coef0[2] + coef0[3]`.

No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` and `visited[2]` is `True`, `coef0` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef0[2]` is updated to some value and `coef0[3]` is updated to some value, `coef1` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef1[2]` is updated to some value, `nodes` is a list containing the integers `2` and `3`, `i` is 2, `c0` is `2 * coef0[2] + coef0[3]`, `c1` is `c1` + `coef1[2]` + `coef1[j]`, and `ok` is `True`, `j` is 3**.
