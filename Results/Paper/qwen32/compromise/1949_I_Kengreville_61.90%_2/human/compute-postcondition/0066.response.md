The code snippet `c0 += coef0[j]` updates the value of `c0` by adding the value of `coef0[j]` to it. The initial state specifies that `c0` is `coef0[j]`, and after the operation, `c0` becomes `coef0[j] + coef0[j]` or `2 * coef0[j]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` and `visited[2]` is `True`, `coef0` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef0[2]` is updated to some value, `coef1` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef1[2]` is updated to some value, `nodes` is a list containing the integers `2` and `3`, `i` is 2, `c0` is `2 * coef0[j]`, `c1` is `c1` + `coef1[2]`, and `ok` is `True`**.
