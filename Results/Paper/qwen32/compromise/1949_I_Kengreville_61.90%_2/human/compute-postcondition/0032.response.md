The code snippet `c1 += coef1[j]` modifies the value of `c1` by adding the value of `coef1[j]` to it. Given that `j` is the second element in `nodes`, the value of `c1` will be updated to its current value plus `coef1[j]`.

Output State: **`nodes` is a list that contains at least two elements, `c0` is updated to `c0 + 3 * coef0[j]`, `c1` is updated to `c1 + 2 * coef1[j] + coef1[j]`, `j` is the second element in `nodes`.**

In natural language: The value of `c1` is now the sum of its previous value, `2 * coef1[j]`, and `coef1[j]`, which simplifies to `c1 + 3 * coef1[j]`. The values of `nodes`, `c0`, and `j` remain unchanged.
