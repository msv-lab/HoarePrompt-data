The code snippet `ok = ok or c1 != 0` updates the value of `ok` based on its current value and the value of `c1`. Given that `ok` is initially `True`, the expression `ok or c1 != 0` will always evaluate to `True` regardless of the value of `c1`. This is because in a logical OR operation, if the first operand is `True`, the entire expression is `True` without needing to evaluate the second operand.

Thus, the value of `ok` remains `True`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` and `visited[2]` is `True`, `coef0` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef0[2]` is updated to some value and `coef0[3]` is updated to some value, `coef1` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef1[2]` is updated to some value and `coef1[3]` is updated to some value, `nodes` is a list containing the integers `2` and `3`, `i` is 2, `c0` is `coef0[2] + coef0[3]`, `c1` is `coef1[2] + coef1[3]`, and `ok` is `True`.**
