The code assigns the value of `-coef1[i]` to `coef1[j]`. This means that the value of `coef1[j]` is now the negative of the previous value of `coef1[i]`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n; `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers representing the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and radii of the disks respectively; `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `dx` is the difference between `x[i]` and `x[j]`; `dy` is the difference between `y[i]` and `y[j]`; `coef0[j]` is assigned the value `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`; `coef1[j]` is `-coef1[i]`.**
