Postcondition: **`i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n. If `visited[i]` is `False`, then `visited[i]` and `visited[j]` for all disks `j` that are touching `i` and have been visited through `dfs(j)` are set to `True`, `nodes` includes `i` and all disks `j` that are touching `i` and have been visited through `dfs(j)`, and `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` are updated for all disks `j` that are touching `i` and have been visited through `dfs(j)`. If `visited[i]` is `True`, then no changes are made to `visited`, `nodes`, `coef0`, or `coef1`.**
