The code snippet `c1 += coef1[j]` increments the value of `c1` by the value of `coef1[j]`. Given that `j` is 3, `c1` will be updated to `c1 + coef1[3]`.

The other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions for `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, `nodes`, `i`, `c0`, `ok`, and `j` still hold.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` and `visited[2]` is `True`, `coef0` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef0[2]` is updated to some value and `coef0[3]` is updated to some value, `coef1` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef1[2]` is updated to some value, `nodes` is a list containing the integers `2` and `3`, `i` is 2, `c0` is `2 * coef0[2] + coef0[3]`, `c1` is `c1` + `coef1[2]` + `coef1[3]`, `ok` is `True`, `j` is 3.**
