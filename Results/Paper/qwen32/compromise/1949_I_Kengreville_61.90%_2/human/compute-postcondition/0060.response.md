Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` and `visited[2]` is `True`, `coef0` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef0[2]` is updated to some value, `coef1` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef1[2]` is updated to some value, `nodes` is a list containing the integer `2`, `i` is 2, `c0` is 0, `c1` is updated to some value, and `ok` is `True`.**

In this output state, the value of `c0` has been updated to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values or states as described.
