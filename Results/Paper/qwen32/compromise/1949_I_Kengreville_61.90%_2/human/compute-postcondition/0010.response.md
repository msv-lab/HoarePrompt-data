Postcondition: **`i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n; `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers representing the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and radii of the disks respectively; `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited, and now `visited[i]` is True. If `visited[j]` was False and the disks `i` and `j` are touching (i.e., `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2`), then `visited[j]` is now True, `nodes` includes both `i` and `j`, `coef0[j]` is set to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, and `coef1[j]` is set to `-coef1[i]`. Otherwise, `visited[j]` remains False, `nodes` only includes `i`, and `coef0` and `coef1` remain unchanged.**
