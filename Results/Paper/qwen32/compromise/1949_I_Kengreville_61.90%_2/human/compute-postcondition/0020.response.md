The code snippet assigns the value of `y[i] - y[j]` to the variable `dy`. This means `dy` now holds the difference between the y-coordinate of the i-th disk and the y-coordinate of the j-th disk. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.

Output State: **`i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n; `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers representing the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and radii of the disks respectively; `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `dx` is the difference between `x[i]` and `x[j]`; `dy` is the difference between `y[i]` and `y[j]`.**
