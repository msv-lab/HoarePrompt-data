Output State: **`i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the number of disks. `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers representing the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and radii of the disks respectively. `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited, and the current value of `visited[i]` is True. `nodes` is a list that will store the indices of the disks that are part of the current connected component. `coef0` and `coef1` are lists used to store coefficients related to the constraints of the problem.**

In simple terms, the disk at index `i` has now been marked as visited in the `visited` list, while all other variables remain unchanged.
