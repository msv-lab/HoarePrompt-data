Functionality: **The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search starting from a given disk index `i` to identify all disks that are part of the same connected component. It updates the `visited` list to mark these disks as visited, appends their indices to the `nodes` list, and updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists for these disks based on their radii and positions.**
