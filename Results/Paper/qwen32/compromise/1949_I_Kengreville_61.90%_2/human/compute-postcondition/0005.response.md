The code snippet `dy = y[i] - y[j]` calculates the difference between the y-coordinates of the disks at indices `i` and `j`. This calculation does not affect any other variables except for introducing a new variable `dy` which holds this difference.

Given the initial state, all other variables retain their previous values, and `dy` is newly introduced to store the computed difference.

Output State: **`i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the number of disks and must be greater than 0; `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers representing the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and radii of the disks respectively; `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited, and the current value of `visited[i]` is True; `nodes` is a list that will store the indices of the disks that are part of the current connected component, and now `nodes` includes `i`; `coef0` and `coef1` are lists used to store coefficients related to the constraints of the problem; `dx` is the value of `x[i] - x[j]`; `dy` is the value of `y[i] - y[j]`.**
