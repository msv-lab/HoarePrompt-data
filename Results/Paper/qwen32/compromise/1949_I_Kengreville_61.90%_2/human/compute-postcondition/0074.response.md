Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` where each element is `True` if it was visited during the loop, `coef0` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is updated based on the `dfs` function if it was not visited before, `coef1` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is updated based on the `dfs` function if it was not visited before, `nodes` is an empty list, `ok` is `True` if there was at least one iteration where `c1` was not `0`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop complete:
- `n` remains the same, indicating the number of elements in the lists.
- `x`, `y`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the loop.
- `visited` will have `True` for all indices that were processed by the loop.
- `coef0` and `coef1` will have integer values assigned to them based on the `dfs` function for indices that were not visited before.
- `nodes` will be reset to an empty list after each iteration.
- `ok` will be `True` if any iteration resulted in `c1` being non-zero, indicating that there was at least one node with a non-zero coefficient in `coef1`.
