### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to determine if it is possible to adjust the radii of the disks such that the conditions outlined in the problem statement are met. However, there are several issues with the provided code that need to be addressed:

1. **Function Scope**: The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` are defined in `func_1()`. However, they are used within `dfs()`, which is not defined within the scope of `func_1()`. This will result in a `NameError` unless these variables are defined globally or passed as arguments to `dfs()`.

2. **DFS Implementation**: The DFS function is supposed to traverse the graph of disks that are tangent to each other. The function should check if the sum of the coefficients (`c0` and `c1`) is non-zero, which would indicate that we can adjust the radii in a way that decreases the total sum while maintaining tangency. However, the current implementation does not handle the graph traversal correctly. Specifically, it does not build any adjacency list or graph representation of the tangencies between disks.

3. **Graph Representation**: The code does not construct an adjacency list or graph representation of the disks that are tangent to each other. This is crucial for correctly performing a DFS to determine if the radii can be adjusted.

4. **Logic for Radius Adjustment**: The logic for determining if the radii can be adjusted to meet the conditions is not correctly implemented. The program should ensure that the sum of the coefficients (`c0` and `c1`) is non-zero after traversing the graph of tangent disks.

### Correctness:

Given the above issues, the provided program is incorrect. It does not correctly represent the graph of tangent disks, nor does it properly implement the DFS to check the conditions for adjusting the radii.

**Correctness: False**
