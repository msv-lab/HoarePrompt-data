Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

In the second sample, depicted below, there is no way to change the radii of
the disks in the desired manner.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, x, y, and r are lists of integers where x[i], y[i] are the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk and r[i] is the radius of the i-th disk, with -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9 for each i in the range [0, n-1]. visited is a list of boolean values initialized to False, coef0 and coef1 are lists of None values initialized to store coefficients for each disk, and nodes is an initially empty list used to store indices of disks during the depth-first search (DFS) process.

    if ok :

Specifically, if `ok` is `True`, it indicates that there was at least one iteration where `c1` was not `0`; otherwise, `ok` is `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input values representing the number of disks and their respective coordinates and radii. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) to process each disk, updating coefficients and marking disks as visited. The function determines if there is at least one iteration where a specific condition (c1 != 0) is met and prints "YES" if true, otherwise prints "NO".

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the number of disks. x, y, and r are lists of integers representing the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and radii of the disks respectively. visited is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited. nodes is a list that will store the indices of the disks that are part of the current connected component. coef0 and coef1 are lists used to store coefficients related to the constraints of the problem.

    #State: `i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n. If `visited[i]` is `False`, then `visited[i]` and `visited[j]` for all disks `j` that are touching `i` and have been visited through `dfs(j)` are set to `True`, `nodes` includes `i` and all disks `j` that are touching `i` and have been visited through `dfs(j)`, and `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` are updated for all disks `j` that are touching `i` and have been visited through `dfs(j)`. If `visited[i]` is `True`, then no changes are made to `visited`, `nodes`, `coef0`, or `coef1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search starting from a given disk index `i` to identify all disks that are part of the same connected component. It updates the `visited` list to mark these disks as visited, appends their indices to the `nodes` list, and updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists for these disks based on their radii and positions.
