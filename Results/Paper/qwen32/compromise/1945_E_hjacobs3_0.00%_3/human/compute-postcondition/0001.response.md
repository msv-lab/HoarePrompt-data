Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`), `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`.**

Natural language: The variables `l` and `r` have been initialized to 0 and `n - 1` respectively. The initial state of `array` and `find` remains unchanged.
