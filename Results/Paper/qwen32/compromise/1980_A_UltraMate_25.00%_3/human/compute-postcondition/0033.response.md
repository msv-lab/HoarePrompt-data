The code snippet assigns the values from the input to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state mentions that `k * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)` and `t` is greater than 0, but these conditions do not affect the assignment of `n` and `m` directly. After executing the code, `n` and `m` will hold the integer values provided by the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)`, `t` is greater than 0**.
