The code increments `ans` by the difference between `m` and `hmp[i]`. Given that `ans` was initially `k * m` (where `k` is the number of characters in 'ABCDEF' not present in `s`), and `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, the new value of `ans` will be `k * m + (m - hmp[i])`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`ans` is `k * m + m - hmp[i]`, where `k` is the number of characters in 'ABCDEF' not present in `s`; `hmp` is an iterable with at least one element; the current value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.**
