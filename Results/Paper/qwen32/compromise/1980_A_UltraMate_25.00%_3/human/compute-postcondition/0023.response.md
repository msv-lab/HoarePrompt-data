To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over `hmp`, which means the variable `i` will change to the next element in `hmp`.

Given:
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is: `ans` is `k * m + m - hmp[i]` if `hmp[i]` is less than `m`; otherwise, `ans` remains `k * m`.
- `hmp` is an iterable with at least one element.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **Variable `i`:** Since `i` is the current element being processed in the loop, it needs to be updated to the next element in `hmp` for the next iteration.
2. **Variable `ans`:** The value of `ans` is calculated based on the current value of `i`. For the next iteration, `ans` will be recalculated using the new value of `i`.

Since we don't have specific values for `k`, `m`, or the elements in `hmp`, we'll represent the state in terms of these variables.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some element in `hmp`.
- For the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in `hmp`.
- `ans` will be recalculated based on this new value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` is the next element in `hmp`.
- `ans` is recalculated as `k * m + m - hmp[new_i]` if `hmp[new_i]` is less than `m`; otherwise, `ans` remains `k * m`.

Assuming `hmp` is an iterable and we are moving to the next element, let's denote the next element as `new_i`.

State: **`ans` is `k * m + m - hmp[new_i]` if `hmp[new_i]` is less than `m`; otherwise, `ans` remains `k * m`, `i` is the next element in `hmp`**. 

However, since we don't have a specific way to denote "the next element" without knowing the structure of `hmp`, we can simply say:

State: **`ans` is recalculated based on the next element in `hmp`, `i` is the next element in `hmp`**.
