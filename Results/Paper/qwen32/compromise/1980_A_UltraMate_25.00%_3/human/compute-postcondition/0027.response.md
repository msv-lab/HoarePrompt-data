Given the initial state and the code snippet, the value of `ans` is adjusted based on the condition `if hmp[i] < m`. Since the code snippet directly adds `m - hmp[i]` to `ans`, it implies that the condition `hmp[i] < m` is true (otherwise, the line `ans += m - hmp[i]` would not be executed as described).

Therefore, the new value of `ans` is its previous value plus `m - hmp[i]`.

The variable `i` is not modified in the given code snippet, so it remains the same.

Output State: **`ans` is recalculated as its previous value plus `m - hmp[i]`; `i` is the next key in `hmp`.**
