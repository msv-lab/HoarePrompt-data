Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`, and a string `s` of length `n`. It calculates and prints the minimum number of changes required to ensure that each character from 'A' to 'F' appears at least `m` times in the string `s`. If a character from 'A' to 'F' is missing entirely, it counts as `m` changes.**
