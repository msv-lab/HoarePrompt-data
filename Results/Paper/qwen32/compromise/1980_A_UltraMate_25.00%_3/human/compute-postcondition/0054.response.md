Output State: **`ans` is recalculated as `ans + (m - hmp[i])`; `hmp` is an iterable with at least one element; `i` is the next index in `hmp`.**

Natural Language: The value of `ans` is updated by adding the difference between `m` and the element at index `i` in `hmp`. The iterable `hmp` remains unchanged and still has at least one element. The index `i` also remains unchanged as it still refers to the next index in `hmp`.
