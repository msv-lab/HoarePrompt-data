Precondition: **The function `func` takes no direct input parameters. However, it is expected to read input from standard input, which includes multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5) representing the length of the array `a`. The next line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the elements of the array. The following line contains an integer `q` (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5) representing the number of queries. The next `q` lines each contain two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n) representing the boundaries of each query. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5, and the sum of `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.**
