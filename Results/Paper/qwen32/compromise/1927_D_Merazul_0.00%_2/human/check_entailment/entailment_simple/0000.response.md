### Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program uses `*_, k = R()`, which is incorrect for reading the number of elements `n` and the array `a`. It should read `n` first and then read `n` integers for the array `a`.

2. **Processing Queries:**
   - The program reads `b = {*R()}` which seems to be an attempt to read queries, but it is incorrectly used. The queries should be processed one by one, not as a set.
   - The logic inside the loop is not related to the problem. It seems to be some attempt to check for the presence of elements, but it does not address the requirement to find two different elements within the specified range of each query.

3. **Output:**
   - The program outputs `'YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2]` which is not related to the problem's output requirements. The problem requires outputting two indices `i` and `j` or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

### Correct Solution Approach:

1. **Read Input:**
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read `n` and the array `a`.
   - Read `q` and then `q` queries, each consisting of `l` and `r`.

2. **Process Each Query:**
   - For each query, check the subarray `a[l-1:r]` (since the problem specifies 1-based indexing).
   - Determine if there are at least two different elements in the subarray. If so, output their indices. If not, output `-1 -1`.

3. **Output:**
   - Print the results for each query.

### Correctness:

Given the issues described above, the provided program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
