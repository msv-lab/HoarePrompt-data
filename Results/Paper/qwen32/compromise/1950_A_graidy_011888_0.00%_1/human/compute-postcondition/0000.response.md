Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; `i` is 1.**

In natural language: The initial state remains mostly unchanged, with the only change being that the variable `i` is assigned the value 1. The conditions for `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain the same as in the initial state.
