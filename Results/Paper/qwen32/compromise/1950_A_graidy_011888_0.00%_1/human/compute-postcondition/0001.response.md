The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than or equal to 1000.

Right before the loop, `i` is 1. Since `i` is 1, which is less than or equal to 1000, the loop can certainly execute at least once without any need for adjustment.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; `i` is 1**
