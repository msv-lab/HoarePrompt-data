You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Output

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        ans = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(a) - 2:
            s = a[i:i + 3]
            if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
                i += 3
                ans += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, and s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

                i += 3
                ans += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: A series of integers, each representing the number of occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in the respective test case's string.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code only checks for the substrings "map" and "pie" in non-overlapping chunks of three characters at a time. This means it does not handle cases where the substrings overlap or where removing a character could prevent the formation of these substrings in subsequent parts of the string.

For example, consider the input string "pimapie". The code will not correctly handle this string:

- The code checks the first three characters "pim" (not "map" or "pie").
- It then checks the next three characters "ima" (not "map" or "pie").
- It then checks the next three characters "map" (this is "map", so it increments the answer and moves the index by 3).
- It then checks the next three characters "ie" (out of bounds, so it stops).

However, the optimal solution would be to remove just one character ('m') to make the string "piie" which does not contain "map" or "pie". The current code would output 1, but the correct answer should be 1, but due to the logic flaw, it may not handle all cases optimally.

Another example is the string "mapiepie". The code will remove "map" and "pie" separately, resulting in 2 deletions. However, removing just two characters ('m' and 'p') can make the string "aiepie" which does not contain "map" or "pie". The correct answer should be 2, but the code may not handle this optimally either.

Thus, the code does not guarantee the minimum number of deletions in all cases, making it incorrect.
