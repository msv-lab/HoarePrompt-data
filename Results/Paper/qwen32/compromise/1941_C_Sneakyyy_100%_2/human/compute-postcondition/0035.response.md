The code snippet `i += 3` increments the value of `i` by 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the new input string with length greater than 2; `ans` is 0; `i` is 3; `s` is the substring of `a` from index 0 to 2. The substring `s` is either 'map' or 'pie'.**
