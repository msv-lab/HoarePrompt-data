The code snippet extracts a substring of length 3 from the string `a` starting at index `i`, which is initially 0. Therefore, `s` will hold the first three characters of the string `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string with length at least 3; `ans` is 0; `i` is 0; `s` is the first three characters of `a`.**
