The loop head in the provided for loop is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times determined by `int(input())`. This means that the state of `t`, `n`, `a`, `ans`, and `i` cannot be directly adjusted based on the loop head. However, the loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`.

Given that the loop is designed to execute a specific number of times based on the input, the state of the loop counter (which is not explicitly named but is controlled by the input) needs to be adjusted. Since the loop counter is not directly accessible or modifiable in the provided state, we can infer that the input value must be decremented to allow the loop to execute one more time.

However, since we are only allowed to modify the states of objects in the loop head, and there are no such objects to modify directly, the state remains unchanged in terms of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `ans`, and `i`. The only change that can be conceptually inferred is a decrement in the implicit loop counter controlled by `int(input())`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the input string; `ans` is the total number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in `a`; `i` is the smallest integer such that `i >= len(a) - 2`**
