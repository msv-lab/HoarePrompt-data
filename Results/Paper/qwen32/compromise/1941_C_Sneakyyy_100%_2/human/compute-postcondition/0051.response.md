Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the new input string with length greater than 2; `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2`. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is either 1, 2, or 3, and `i` is increased by 3. Otherwise, `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2, and `i` is incremented by 1. In both cases, `i` must be less than `len(a) - 2`.**
