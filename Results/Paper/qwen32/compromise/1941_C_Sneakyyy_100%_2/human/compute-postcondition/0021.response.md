The value of `i` is incremented by 3. Given that `i` was originally either 6 or 2, after the increment, `i` will be either 9 or 5. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `s`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string with length greater than or equal to 8; if `i` was originally 6, `s` is now `a[6:9]` and `ans` is 2, `i` is now 9; if `i` was originally 2, `s` is now `a[2:5]` and `ans` is 0, `i` is now 5.**
