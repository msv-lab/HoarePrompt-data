The code snippet `a = input()` changes the value of the variable `a` to whatever string is provided as input. The values of `t`, `n`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the new input string; `ans` is the total number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the original `a`; `i` is the smallest integer such that `i >= len(a) - 2`**.
