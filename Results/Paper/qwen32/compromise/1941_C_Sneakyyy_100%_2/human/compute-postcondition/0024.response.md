Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string with length greater than or equal to 8; if `i` was originally 6, `s` is now `a[6:9]` and `ans` is 3 if `s` was 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 2; if `i` was originally 2, `s` is now `a[2:5]` and `ans` is 1 if `s` was 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0; `i` is now 9 if it was originally 6 and `s` was 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 7; `i` is now 5 if it was originally 2 and `s` was 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 3.**
