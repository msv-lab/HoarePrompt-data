Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the new input string with length greater than 2; `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2`; `ans` is either 1, 2, or 3 based on the original `s`; `i` must be less than `len(a) - 2` and `i` is increased by 3.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. Since `ans` was originally either 0, 1, or 2, after the increment, `ans` will be either 1, 2, or 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
