Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a`, a list of `k` distinct integers sorted in ascending order where each integer is between 1 and 100, and `b`, a list of `q` integers where each integer is between 1 and 100. The function returns a list where each element is 1 less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`. If the conditions for `a` are met but not specified for `b`, the function still returns the modified list `a`. If the conditions for `a` are not met, the behavior is unspecified based on the given information. However, based on the provided cases, if the conditions for `a` are satisfied, it returns the modified list `a`; otherwise, it returns list `b`.**
