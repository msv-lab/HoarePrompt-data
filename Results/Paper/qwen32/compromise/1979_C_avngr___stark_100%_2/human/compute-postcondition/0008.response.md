To determine the output state, we need to understand the behavior of the code snippet provided. The code snippet iteratively applies a function `func_1` to the initial `result` (which is `numbers[0]`) and each subsequent element in the list `numbers` starting from the second element. The final `result` after all iterations is returned.

Given the initial state:
- The loop will execute for each element in `numbers` starting from the second element.
- The final `result` is the cumulative result of applying `func_1` to the initial `result` (which is `numbers[0]`) and each subsequent element in `numbers`.

Since we do not have the definition of `func_1` and the contents of `numbers`, we can only describe the final `result` in terms of the process described.

Output State: **The program returns the final value obtained by sequentially applying `func_1` to the initial `result` (which is `numbers[0]`) and each element in `numbers` starting from the second element until the last element.**
