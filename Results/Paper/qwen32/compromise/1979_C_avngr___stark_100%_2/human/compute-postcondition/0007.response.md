To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's first understand the loop's behavior and the provided output states after the first three iterations.

The loop iterates over the list `numbers` starting from the second element (index 1). In each iteration, it applies the function `func_1` to the current `result` and the current element `num` from the list `numbers`. The result of `func_1(result, num)` is then assigned back to `result`.

Given:
- Initial State: `result` is set to the first element of `numbers`.
- Loop: For each `num` in `numbers[1:]`, `result` is updated to `func_1(result, num)`.

From the provided output states:
- After the first iteration, `result` is the output of `func_1(result, numbers[1])`.
- After the second iteration, `result` is the output of `func_1(result, numbers[2])`.
- After the third iteration, `result` is the output of `func_1(result, numbers[3])`.

Following this pattern, the loop will continue until it has processed all elements in `numbers[1:]`.

**Final Output State:**
- The loop will execute for each element in `numbers` starting from the second element until the end of the list.
- The final `result` will be the cumulative result of applying `func_1` to the initial `result` (which is `numbers[0]`) and each subsequent element in `numbers`.

In natural language:
- After all iterations, `result` will be the final value obtained by applying `func_1` sequentially to the initial `result` and each element in `numbers` starting from the second element until the last element.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **result is the final value obtained by applying `func_1` sequentially from the initial `result` (which is `numbers[0]`) to each element in `numbers[1:]`.**
