### Reasoning:
The provided Python program is designed to solve the given problem by calculating the bets for each outcome such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

Let's break down the logic step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`.

2. **LCM Calculation:**
   - The `func_2` function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k`. This is done by sequentially applying the `func_1` function, which calculates the LCM of two numbers.

3. **Bet Calculation:**
   - For each outcome, the bet `c[i]` is calculated as the LCM divided by the corresponding multiplier `k[i]`. This ensures that if the i-th outcome wins, the received amount (`k[i] * c[i]`) is exactly the LCM.
   - The program checks if the sum of all bets `c` is less than the LCM. If it is not, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution is possible.
   - If the sum of bets is valid, it prints the bets.

4. **Validation:**
   - The logic ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the received amount for any winning outcome because the received amount for the i-th outcome is `k[i] * c[i] = LCM`, which is greater than the sum of all bets `c` (since `c[i] = LCM / k[i]` and `sum(c) < LCM`).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets for each outcome such that the total bet is strictly less than the received amount for any winning outcome. The use of the LCM ensures that the received amount for any winning outcome is the same and greater than the total bet.

**Correctness: True**
