### Reasoning:

The program is attempting to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The key part of the program is the calculation of the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i` using the `func_2` function. The LCM is used to determine a potential sum `m` that can be used to distribute the bets.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness:

1. **LCM Calculation**: The `func_2` function calculates the LCM of the list of multipliers `k_i`. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the `k_i`. This is a valid approach because we need to ensure that the sum of the bets is less than the amount received for any winning outcome, and the LCM provides a common basis for this comparison.

2. **Bet Distribution**: The program then calculates the bets by dividing the LCM `m` by each multiplier `k_i` to get the bets `c_i`. This ensures that if any outcome `i` wins, the received amount `k_i * c_i` will be at least `m` (since `c_i = m // k_i`).

3. **Validation**: The program checks if the total sum of the bets `sum(c)` is less than `m`. If it is, the bets are valid and printed. If not, it prints `-1`, indicating that no valid distribution exists.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program's approach:

- The program does not ensure that the total sum of the bets `sum(c)` is strictly less than `m`. It only checks if the sum is less than or equal to `m`. This means that if `sum(c) == m`, the program would incorrectly consider it a valid distribution, which does not satisfy the requirement of coming out ahead.

For example, consider the case where `n = 2` and `k = [2, 2]`. The LCM is `2`, and the bets would be `[1, 1]`, resulting in a total sum of `2`, which is not strictly less than `2`.

### Correctness:

Given the logical flaw described above, the program is not always correct.

**Correctness: False**
