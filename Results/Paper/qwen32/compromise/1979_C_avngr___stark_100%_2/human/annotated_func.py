#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)
    #The program returns the least common multiple (LCM) of integers `a` and `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns their least common multiple (LCM).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers, where each integer is a multiplier \( k_i \) for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning.
def func_2(numbers):
    result = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        result = func_1(result, num)
        
    #State: - The loop will execute for each element in `numbers` starting from the second element until the end of the list.
    #- The final `result` will be the cumulative result of applying `func_1` to the initial `result` (which is `numbers[0]`) and each subsequent element in `numbers`.
    #
    #In natural language:
    #- After all iterations, `result` will be the final value obtained by applying `func_1` sequentially to the initial `result` and each element in `numbers` starting from the second element until the last element.
    #
    #Thus, the final output state is:
    #Output State:
    return result
    #The program returns the final value obtained by sequentially applying `func_1` to the initial `result` (which is `numbers[0]`) and each element in `numbers` starting from the second element until the last element.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes a list of integers called `numbers` and returns the final value obtained by sequentially applying `func_1` to the first element of `numbers` and each subsequent element in the list.
