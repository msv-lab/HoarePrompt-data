To determine the output state, we need to consider the conditions and values given in the initial state. The key points are:

1. `total_max_segment` is defined conditionally based on its length.
2. If the length of `total_max_segment` is 1, it is set to `[-1]`.
3. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains `[7, 4]`.

Since the problem does not specify the length of `total_max_segment` directly, we must infer its length based on the given conditions. However, since the return statement directly uses `total_max_segment` without any modification in the provided code snippet, we can assume the value based on the conditions:

- If the length of `total_max_segment` is 1, it would be `[-1]`.
- If the length of `total_max_segment` is not 1, it would be `[7, 4]`.

Since the problem does not provide additional context to determine the exact length of `total_max_segment` before the return statement, we consider both possibilities. But typically, such a condition would be set before the return, and since it's not, we assume the default value from the conditions provided.

Given the conditions, the most straightforward interpretation is that `total_max_segment` is `[7, 4]` unless specified otherwise. Since there's no indication that its length is 1, we assume it remains `[7, 4]`.

Output State: **The program returns [7, 4]**.
