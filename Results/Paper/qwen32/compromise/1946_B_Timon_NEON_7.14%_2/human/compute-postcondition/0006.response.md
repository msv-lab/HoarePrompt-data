The code appends a new list to `segments_variants`. This new list is formed by concatenating `max_segment` with a list containing the length of `arr` minus one. Since `max_segment` is `[5, 3]` and the length of `arr` is not specified, we can denote the length of `arr` as `len(arr)`. Therefore, the new list that is appended is `[5, 3, len(arr) - 1]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers; `new_segment` is [5, 6]; `max_segment` is [5, 3]; `segments_variants` is [[3, 1], [7, 4], [5, 3, len(arr) - 1]]; `max_sum` is -1.**
