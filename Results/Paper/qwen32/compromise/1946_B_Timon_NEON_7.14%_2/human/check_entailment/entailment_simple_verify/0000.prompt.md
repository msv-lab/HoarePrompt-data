You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any
contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this
subarray anywhere in the array.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such
operations.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y
such that there exists an integer q and x = p \cdot q + y .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le
2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can
be obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the
array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the
sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7
this is 999\,999\,996 .

In the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire
array three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible
sequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \rightarrow [2, 2,
8, 12, 24 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is
2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .

In the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array
consisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2
and 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining
the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .

In the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an
empty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will
not differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the
original array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =
-6\,000\,000\,000) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The provided program is incomplete and does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incomplete Functionality**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function simply returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). While this is a necessary operation, it is not sufficient to solve the problem.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function seems to be trying to find the maximum sum subarray (similar to Kadane's algorithm), but it doesn't correctly handle all edge cases and doesn't return a meaningful value for the problem at hand.
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function is incomplete and does not perform any meaningful operation. It simply initializes a variable `answer` to 0 and then does nothing.

2. **Lack of Main Logic**:
   - The main logic to perform the described operations (inserting the sum of a subarray into the array) is completely missing. The problem requires performing exactly `k` operations to maximize the sum of the array, and this logic is not present in the provided code.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle negative numbers, zero, or very large numbers effectively. For example, if all numbers in the array are negative, the code should handle this scenario correctly.
   - The code does not account for the possibility of an empty subarray being the optimal choice for insertion.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - While the modulo operation is correctly implemented in `func_1`, it is not applied consistently throughout the code. The final result should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\), but this is not ensured in the provided code.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 3
2 2 8
```
The expected output is `96`. However, the provided code does not perform the necessary operations to achieve this result. The code does not even attempt to insert the sum of subarrays into the array, so it cannot produce the correct output.

### Conclusion:
Given the incomplete and incorrect implementation, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
