Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to maximize the sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting any contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting that sum anywhere in the array. The goal is to maximize the final sum of the array, and the result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Key Observations:
1. **Maximizing the Sum**: The best strategy is to repeatedly add the sum of the maximum subarray (positive sum) to the array. This is because adding a positive sum will always increase the total sum.
2. **Empty Subarray**: If all subarrays have a non-positive sum, adding the sum of an empty subarray (which is 0) will not change the sum, but it's a valid operation.
3. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, we need to take the final sum modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Program Analysis:
Let's analyze the provided functions:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes a number and returns it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - This is correct and useful for ensuring that the final result is within the required range.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function seems to be designed to find the maximum subarray sum and its indices.
   - However, the implementation is incorrect. The function does not correctly handle the case where all subarrays are non-positive, and it does not return the correct maximum subarray sum.
   - The logic for tracking segments and updating the maximum segment is flawed, and the function does not handle edge cases properly.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function is incomplete and does not perform any operations. It is supposed to compute the maximum possible sum after `k` operations, but it is not implemented.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because:
- `func_2` does not correctly identify the maximum subarray sum.
- `func_3` is not implemented and does not perform the required operations to compute the maximum sum after `k` operations.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
