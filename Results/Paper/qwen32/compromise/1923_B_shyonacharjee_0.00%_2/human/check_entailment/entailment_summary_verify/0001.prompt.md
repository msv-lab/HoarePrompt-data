You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        healths = list(map(int, input().split()))
        positions = list(map(int, input().split()))
        monsters = sorted(zip(positions, healths), key=lambda x: abs(x[0]))
        total_bullets_used = 0
        success = True
        for i in range(n):
            (position, health) = monsters[i]
            distance = abs(position)
            time_available = distance
            bullets_needed = health
            if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
                success = False
                break
            total_bullets_used += bullets_needed
        print('YES' if success else 'NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it determines if it is possible to defeat all monsters within the constraints given their health and positions. It outputs 'YES' if all monsters can be defeated, otherwise 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of monsters) and `k` (maximum bullets per second).
   - It then reads the healths and positions of the monsters.

2. **Sorting Monsters:**
   - The monsters are sorted based on their distance from the character (point 0). This is done using `sorted(zip(positions, healths), key=lambda x: abs(x[0]))`.
   - This ensures that the program considers the closest monsters first, which is a reasonable strategy because closer monsters are more urgent to kill to prevent them from reaching the character.

3. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - The program initializes `total_bullets_used` to 0 and `success` to `True`.
   - It iterates through the sorted list of monsters.
   - For each monster, it calculates the distance from the character, `distance`, and the time available to kill the monster, `time_available`.
   - It calculates the `bullets_needed` to kill the monster.
   - If the total bullets used so far plus the bullets needed for the current monster exceeds the time available, the program sets `success` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, it adds the bullets needed for the current monster to `total_bullets_used`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing each test case, the program prints "YES" if `success` is `True` and "NO" otherwise.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The strategy of sorting monsters by their distance from the character is sound because it prioritizes killing the closest monsters first, which is crucial to prevent them from reaching the character.
- The condition `if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available` ensures that the program checks whether it is possible to kill each monster before it reaches the character.
- However, the program does not consider the constraint that `k` bullets can be fired per second. It assumes that an unlimited number of bullets can be fired at once, which is not aligned with the problem description.

### Example Analysis:
- Consider the second test case: `n = 2`, `k = 1`, `healths = [1, 1]`, `positions = [-1, 1]`.
  - The monsters are sorted by distance: `[(1, 1), (-1, 1)]`.
  - For the first monster at position 1, `time_available = 1` and `bullets_needed = 1`. Since `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed = 1 <= time_available`, it proceeds.
  - For the second monster at position -1, `time_available = 1` and `bullets_needed = 1`. Since `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed = 2 > time_available`, it sets `success` to `False`.
  - The program correctly outputs "NO" because it cannot kill both monsters in time with only 1 bullet per second.
  
- However, the program would incorrectly output "YES" if it did not consider the constraint `k`. For example, if `k` was 2, the program should output "YES" because it could kill both monsters in one second.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not account for the constraint that only `k` bullets can be fired per second. It assumes an unlimited number of bullets can be fired at once.
