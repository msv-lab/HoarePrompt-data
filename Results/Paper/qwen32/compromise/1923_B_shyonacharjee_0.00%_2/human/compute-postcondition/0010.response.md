Output State: **`t` is 1; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is an integer; `healths` is a list of integers; `positions` is a list of integers; `monsters` is a list of tuples (position, health) sorted by the absolute value of the position; `total_bullets_used` is 0; `success` is True; `position` is the position from the `i`-th tuple in `monsters`; `health` is the health from the `i`-th tuple in `monsters`; `distance` is `abs(position)`**

In simple terms, the variable `distance` has been added and is equal to the absolute value of `position`. All other variables remain unchanged.
