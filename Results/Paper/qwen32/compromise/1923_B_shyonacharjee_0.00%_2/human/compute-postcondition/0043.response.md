Output State: **`t` is 1; `n` and `k` are integers from the input; `healths` is a list of integers from the input; `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples (position, health) sorted by the absolute value of the position; `total_bullets_used` is 0; `success` is True if the total bullets used never exceeded the time available for each monster, otherwise False; `position` and `health` are from the last monster in `monsters`; `distance` and `time_available` are the absolute value of the last position; `bullets_needed` is the health of the last monster.**

Explanation: The only change is that `total_bullets_used` has been reset to 0. All other variables have retained their previous values and states.
