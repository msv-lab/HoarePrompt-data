Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples (position, health) sorted by the absolute value of the position, `total_bullets_used` is `2 * bullets_needed`, `position` is the position of the third monster in `monsters`, `health` is the health of the third monster in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is the absolute value of `position`, `bullets_needed` is the health of the third monster, `i` is 2, and `success` is False.**

In this output state, the value of `success` has been explicitly set to `False` by the code snippet. All other variables retain their initial values.
