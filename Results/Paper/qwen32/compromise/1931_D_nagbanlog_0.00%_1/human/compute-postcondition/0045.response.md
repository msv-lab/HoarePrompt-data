The only variable in the loop head is `case`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases` list. If there are more elements in `test_cases`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` contained one element `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3])]`, and `case` was assigned this element. For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must contain at least one more element.

Since the current `test_cases` list has only one element, to ensure the loop executes again, we need to add another element to `test_cases`.

Let's assume the next element in `test_cases` could be `(4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])` (or any other valid tuple following the pattern).

State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3]), (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])], `results` is [0], `n` is 3, `x` is 5, `y` is 7, `a` is [1, 2, 3], `freq` is {(3, 5): 1, (3, 3): 2, (1, 1): 1, (2, 2): 1}, `beautiful_count` is 0, `case` is (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])**
