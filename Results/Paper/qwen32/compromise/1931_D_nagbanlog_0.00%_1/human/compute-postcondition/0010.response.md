To determine the new value of `required_mod_x`, we use the given formula `(x - mod_x) % x`. Given the initial state, `x` is 5 and `mod_x` is 3.

Let's calculate `required_mod_x`:
- `x - mod_x` is `5 - 3`, which equals `2`.
- `(5 - 3) % 5` is `2 % 5`, which equals `2`.

Thus, `required_mod_x` is assigned the value `2`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3])]`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 3, `x` is 5, `y` is 7, `a` is `[1, 2, 3]`, `freq` is `{}`, `beautiful_count` is 0, `mod_x` is 3, `mod_y` is 5, `required_mod_x` is 2**.
