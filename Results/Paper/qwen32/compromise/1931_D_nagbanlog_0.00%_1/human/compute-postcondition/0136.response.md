Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it calculates a "beautiful count" based on specific modular conditions and appends this count to the `results` list. However, due to a logical error in the code, the function incorrectly always appends zero to the `results` list, resulting in a final output of a list containing `t` zeros.**
