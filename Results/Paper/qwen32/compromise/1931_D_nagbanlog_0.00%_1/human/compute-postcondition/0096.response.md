The given code snippet attempts to assign the value of `num % x` to the variable `mod_x`. However, there is no variable named `num` defined in the initial state. Assuming `num` is supposed to be one of the variables from the initial state, let's consider the most likely candidates (`n`, `x`, `y`) and see which one fits the context.

Given the context, `num` is most likely intended to be `n` because `n` is used in the same context as `x` in the initial state. Therefore, we will proceed with `num` being `n`.

Let's calculate `mod_x` using `n % x`:

- `n` is 4
- `x` is 6

So, `mod_x` will be `4 % 6`, which equals `4`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3]), (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])]`, `results` is `[0, 0]`, `n` is 4, `x` is 6, `y` is 8, `a` is `[4, 5, 6]`, `case` is `(4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])`, `beautiful_count` is 0, `freq` is `{}`, `mod_x` is 4**.
