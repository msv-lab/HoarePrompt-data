To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

- `num` is explicitly given as 5.
- `mod_x` is explicitly given as 5.
- `mod_y` is explicitly given as 5.
- `required_mod_x` is explicitly given as 1.
- `required_mod_y` is explicitly given as 5.

Given these explicit values, we can substitute them directly into the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(
    f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
)
```

Substituting the values:
- `num` is 5.
- `mod_x` is 5.
- `mod_y` is 5.
- `required_mod_x` is 1.
- `required_mod_y` is 5.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **Number: 5, mod_x: 5, mod_y: 5, required_mod_x: 1, required_mod_y: 5**
