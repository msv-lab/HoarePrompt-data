To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

- `num`: This variable is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state. Since it is used in the print statement but not defined, we cannot determine its value from the given information. Therefore, we'll assume that `num` is intended to be a placeholder for some value that should be provided or is defined elsewhere in the code not shown here. For the purpose of this task, we'll represent it as `[num]`.

- `mod_x`: This variable is explicitly defined in the initial state with a value of `4`.

- `mod_y`: This variable is explicitly defined in the initial state with a value of `6`.

- `required_mod_x`: This variable is explicitly defined in the initial state with a value of `2`.

- `required_mod_y`: This variable is explicitly defined in the initial state with a value of `6`.

Given these values, the print statement will output a formatted string with the values of these variables.

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: 4, mod_y: 6, required_mod_x: 2, required_mod_y: 6** (where [num] is the value of num)
