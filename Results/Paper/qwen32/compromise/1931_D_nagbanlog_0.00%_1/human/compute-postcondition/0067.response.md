To determine the new value of `required_mod_x`, we use the formula provided in the code snippet:

\[ \text{required\_mod\_x} = (\text{x} - \text{mod\_x}) \% \text{x} \]

Given the initial state:
- `x` is 6
- `mod_x` is 4

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ \text{required\_mod\_x} = (6 - 4) \% 6 \]
\[ \text{required\_mod\_x} = 2 \% 6 \]
\[ \text{required\_mod\_x} = 2 \]

Thus, `required_mod_x` is updated to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3]), (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])], `results` is [0], `n` is 4, `x` is 6, `y` is 8, `a` is [4, 5, 6], `case` is (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6]), `mod_x` is 4, `mod_y` is 6, `required_mod_x` is 2, `required_mod_y` is 6, `freq` is {(4, 6): 1}, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged**
