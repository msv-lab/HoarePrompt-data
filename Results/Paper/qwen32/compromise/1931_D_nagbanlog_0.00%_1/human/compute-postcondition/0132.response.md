Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3]), (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])]`, `results` is `[0, 0, 0]`, `n` is 4, `x` is 6, `y` is 8, `a` is `[4, 5, 6]`, `case` is `(4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])`, `beautiful_count` is 0, `freq` is `{(4, 4): 1, (5, 5): 1, (0, 6): 1}`**

Explanation: The value of `beautiful_count` (which is 0) is appended to the `results` list, making `results` now equal to `[0, 0, 0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
