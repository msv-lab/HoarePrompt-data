The given code snippet increments the variable `beautiful_count` by the value stored in `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. From the initial state, we know that `required_mod_x` is 2 and `required_mod_y` is 3. However, there is no explicit mention of `freq[(2, 3)]` in the initial state. Since `freq[(3, 5)]` is 1 and `freq[(3, 3)]` is 1, we can infer that `freq[(2, 3)]` is not defined in the initial state. Assuming `freq[(2, 3)]` defaults to 0 (as it is not explicitly mentioned), `beautiful_count` would be incremented by 0.

Thus, the only change in the output state is the introduction of `beautiful_count` with a value of 0, as no prior value for `beautiful_count` was mentioned.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3])]`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 3, `x` is 5, `y` is 7, `a` is `[1, 2, 3]`, `mod_x` is 3, `mod_y` is 3, `required_mod_x` is 2, `required_mod_y` is 3, `freq[(3, 5)]` is 1, `freq[(3, 3)]` is 1, `num` is 3, `beautiful_count` is 0**.
