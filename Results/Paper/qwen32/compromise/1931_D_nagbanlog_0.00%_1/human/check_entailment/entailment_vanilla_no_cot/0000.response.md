Correctness: **False**

The given program has a logical error in how it calculates the `required_mod_x`. The condition for a pair `(i, j)` to be beautiful is that both `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`. This translates to:
- `(a_i % x + a_j % x) % x == 0` which simplifies to `a_i % x == -a_j % x` or equivalently `a_i % x == (x - a_j % x) % x`.
- `(a_i % y - a_j % y) % y == 0` which simplifies to `a_i % y == a_j % y`.

However, the program incorrectly sets `required_mod_x` to `(x - mod_x) % x` for every element, which does not correctly account for the requirement that there must exist another element with the complementary modulo value. Instead, it should check for pairs of elements that satisfy both conditions simultaneously.

Here's a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        (n, x, y) = case['params']
        a = case['array']
        freq = {}
        beautiful_count = 0
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            # We need to find pairs (a_i, a_j) such that:
            # (a_i % x == -a_j % x) and (a_i % y == a_j % y)
            # This means we need to find elements with mod_x_complement and mod_y
            mod_x_complement = (x - mod_x) % x
            if (mod_x_complement, mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[(mod_x_complement, mod_y)]
            if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
                freq[(mod_x, mod_y)] = 0
            freq[(mod_x, mod_y)] += 1
        results.append(beautiful_count)
    return results
```

This version correctly tracks the frequency of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` and checks for the existence of the required complement for `mod_x` while maintaining the same `mod_y`.
