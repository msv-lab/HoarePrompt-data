Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to verify its correctness.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find pairs \((i, j)\) such that:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

This translates to:
1. \((a_i + a_j) \% x == 0\)
2. \((a_i - a_j) \% y == 0\)

### Mathematical Analysis:
- For \(a_i \% x = r_i\) and \(a_j \% x = r_j\), the condition \((a_i + a_j) \% x == 0\) implies \(r_i + r_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) or equivalently \(r_j \equiv -r_i \pmod{x}\).
- For \(a_i \% y = s_i\) and \(a_j \% y = s_j\), the condition \((a_i - a_j) \% y == 0\) implies \(s_i \equiv s_j \pmod{y}\).

### Algorithm Explanation:
- For each element in the array, compute its remainders when divided by \(x\) and \(y\).
- Use a dictionary `freq` to keep track of how many times each pair of remainders \((r_i, s_i)\) has been seen.
- For each element, compute the required remainders \((required\_mod\_x, required\_mod\_y)\) such that a previous element with these remainders would form a beautiful pair with the current element.
- If such a pair exists in the dictionary, increment the count of beautiful pairs.
- Update the frequency dictionary with the current element's remainders.

### Implementation Details:
- The program correctly computes the remainders and checks for the required pairs.
- It uses a dictionary to efficiently count and check pairs, which is crucial given the constraints.

### Code Review:
Let's examine the code and the annotations to ensure everything aligns with the mathematical analysis and algorithm explanation.

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        (n, x, y) = case['params']
        a = case['array']
        freq = {}
        beautiful_count = 0
        print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
            required_mod_y = mod_y
            print(f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}')
            if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
            if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
                freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
            freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
        print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
        results.append(beautiful_count)
    return results
```

### Annotations:
The annotations describe the state of the program at various points:
- Before processing each test case, the parameters and array are printed.
- For each number in the array, the remainders and required remainders are printed.
- After processing each test case, the count of beautiful pairs is printed.

### Validation:
- The code correctly calculates the remainders `mod_x` and `mod_y` for each element.
- It calculates the required remainders `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` such that a previous element with these remainders would form a beautiful pair with the current element.
- It checks if the required remainders exist in the frequency dictionary and increments the beautiful pair count accordingly.
- It updates the frequency dictionary with the current element's remainders.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs as per the problem statement. The use of dictionaries ensures that the solution is efficient and works within the given constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the analysis and the annotations, the program appears to be correct.

Final: **True**
