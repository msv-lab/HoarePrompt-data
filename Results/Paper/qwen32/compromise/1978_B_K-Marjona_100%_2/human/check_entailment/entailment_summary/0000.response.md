Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis

Bob is selling `n` buns. The usual price for each bun is `a` coins. However, he can offer a promotion where the first `k` buns are sold at a decreasing price starting from `b`, down to `b - (k-1)`. The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

The goal is to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by choosing an optimal `k`.

### Program Analysis

The program processes each test case by:

1. Reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, reading `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. Calculating `k = min(n, b - a)`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns or the difference between the promotional price and the usual price.
4. If `b <= a`, it means the promotional price is not beneficial, so all buns are sold at the usual price `a`. The profit is `a * n`.
5. Otherwise, the profit is calculated as:
   - The sum of the promotional prices for the first `k` buns: `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`.
   - The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price: `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two amounts.

### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case: `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`**
   - `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = min(4, 1) = 1`
   - Profit = `5 * 1 - 1 * (1 - 1) // 2 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 12 = 17`
   - Correct.

2. **Second Test Case: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`**
   - `k = min(5, 9 - 5) = min(5, 4) = 4`
   - Profit = `9 * 4 - 4 * (4 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 4) * 5 = 36 - 6 + 5 = 35`
   - Correct.

3. **Third Test Case: `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`**
   - `k = min(10, 5 - 10) = min(10, -5) = 0`
   - Profit = `10 * 10 = 100`
   - Correct.

4. **Fourth Test Case: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`**
   - `k = min(5, 11 - 5) = min(5, 6) = 5`
   - Profit = `11 * 5 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 55 - 10 + 0 = 45`
   - Correct.

5. **Fifth Test Case: `n = 1000000000`, `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1000000000`**
   - `k = min(1000000000, 1000000000 - 1000000000) = min(1000000000, 0) = 0`
   - Profit = `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
   - Correct.

6. **Sixth Test Case: `n = 1000000000`, `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1`**
   - `k = min(1000000000, 1 - 1000000000) = min(1000000000, -999999999) = 0`
   - Profit = `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
   - Correct.

7. **Seventh Test Case: `n = 1000`, `a = 1`, `b = 1000`**
   - `k = min(1000, 1000 - 1) = min(1000, 999) = 999`
   - Profit = `1000 * 999 - 999 * (999 - 1) // 2 + (1000 - 999) * 1 = 999000 - 498501 + 1 = 499500 + 1 = 500500`
   - Correct.

### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the maximum profit for each test case based on the given logic. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
