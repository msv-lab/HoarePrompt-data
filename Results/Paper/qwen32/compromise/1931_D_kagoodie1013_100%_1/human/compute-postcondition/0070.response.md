Output State: **`test_cases` remains unchanged, `results` contains the final value of `count` for each test case in `test_cases`, `count` is the total number of times a pair `(r_x, r_y)` has been encountered before for each element in `arr` for each test case, `residue_map` is re-initialized for each test case and contains the frequency of each `(num % x, num % y)` pair encountered in `arr` for that specific test case.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop are finished, the `test_cases` list stays the same. For each test case in `test_cases`, the loop calculates a `count` which represents how many times a specific pair of residues `(r_x, r_y)` has appeared before for each element in the array `arr` of that test case. This `count` is appended to the `results` list. The `residue_map` dictionary is used to keep track of the frequency of each `(num % x, num % y)` pair encountered in the current test case's array `arr` and is re-initialized for each new test case.
