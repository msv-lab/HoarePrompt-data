The code snippet updates the `residue_map` dictionary by incrementing the count for the `current_key`. If `current_key` is not already in the dictionary, it is added with a value of 1. If it is already present, its value is incremented by 1.

Given the initial state, the `residue_map` dictionary will have its entry for `current_key` updated accordingly. The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `count`, `arr`, `r_x`, `r_y`) remain unchanged in terms of their definitions, but the specific values of `residue_map` will reflect the update.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one more tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)` where `arr` is a non-empty list, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is `count + residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with `current_key` mapped to 1 if it was not previously present, or incremented by 1 if it was, `arr` is the non-empty list from the next tuple in `test_cases`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, and `residue_map[current_key]` is incremented by 1.**
