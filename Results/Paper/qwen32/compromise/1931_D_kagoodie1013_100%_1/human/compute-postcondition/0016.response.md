The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has more elements, the loop will execute again for the next element in `arr`.

At the end of the last iteration, `num` is the second element in `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least a third element, and `num` should be set to that third element.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:
State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 1; `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `(n % x, n % y)` mapped to 2; `arr` is the list from the first tuple in `test_cases`; `r_x` is `-num % x`; `r_y` is `num % y`; `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`; `num` is the third element in `arr`**
