The code snippet `r_x = -num % x` updates the value of `r_x` based on the current value of `num` and `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 1; `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `(n % x, n % y)` mapped to 2; `arr` is the list from the first tuple in `test_cases`; `r_x` is `-num % x`; `r_y` is `num % y`; `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`; `num` is the third element in `arr`.**

In natural language: The value of `r_x` is updated to `-num % x`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
