The only objects in the loop head are variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases` list. If there are more tuples in `test_cases`, the loop will execute again for the next tuple.

At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)`. This means that the current tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` has already been processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must still have at least one more tuple.

Since the current iteration has already used the first tuple in `test_cases`, the next iteration will use the next tuple in the list. Therefore, we need to adjust `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` to reflect the values of the next tuple in `test_cases`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one more tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)`; `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `count` is the total number of times a `(r_x, r_y)` pair has been seen before for each element in `arr`; `residue_map` is a dictionary with keys `(num % x, num % y)` mapped to their respective counts; `arr` is the list from the next tuple in `test_cases`.**
