Functionality: **The function processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the number of times a specific pair of residues `(r_x, r_y)` has been encountered before for each element in the list `a`. The result for each test case is stored in a list `results`, which is returned at the end. The input `test_cases` remains unchanged.**
