Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one more tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)` where `arr` has at least one element, `arr` is a list with at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from the next tuple in `test_cases`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`.**

Natural Language: The value of `r_y` has been calculated as `num % y`. All other variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
