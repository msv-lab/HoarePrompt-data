To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables evolve with each iteration.

### Key Variables:
- `arr`: The list of integers that the loop iterates over.
- `residue_map`: A dictionary that keeps track of the count of each `(r_x, r_y)` pair encountered so far.
- `count`: A counter that increments based on the number of times a `(r_x, r_y)` pair has been seen before.

### Loop Behavior:
For each number `num` in `arr`:
1. Calculate `r_x` as `-num % x`.
2. Calculate `r_y` as `num % y`.
3. Update `count` by adding the current count of `(r_x, r_y)` in `residue_map`, if it exists.
4. Update `residue_map` to increment the count of the `(num % x, num % y)` pair.

### Final Output State:
After the loop completes all iterations, `count` will reflect the total number of times a `(r_x, r_y)` pair has been seen before for each element in `arr`. `residue_map` will contain the count of each unique `(num % x, num % y)` pair encountered throughout the loop.

### Calculating the Final Output State:
- `test_cases` remains unchanged as the list of tuples.
- `results` remains an empty list as it is not modified in the loop.
- `count` will be the sum of all previous occurrences of `(r_x, r_y)` pairs for each element in `arr`.
- `residue_map` will have keys corresponding to each unique `(num % x, num % y)` pair and their respective counts.

### Example:
If `arr = [a1, a2, a3, ..., an]`, then:
- For each `ai` in `arr`, compute `(ai % x, ai % y)`.
- Update `count` based on the occurrences of these pairs in `residue_map`.
- Update `residue_map` to reflect the new count of each pair.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is the total number of times a `(r_x, r_y)` pair has been seen before for each element in `arr`; `residue_map` is a dictionary with keys `(num % x, num % y)` mapped to their respective counts; `arr` is the list from the first tuple in `test_cases`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `count` will hold the total number of times a `(r_x, r_y)` pair has been seen before for each element in `arr`, and `residue_map` will have the count of each unique `(num % x, num % y)` pair encountered.
