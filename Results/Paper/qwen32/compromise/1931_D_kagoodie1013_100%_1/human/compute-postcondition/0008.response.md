The variable `current_key` is assigned the value `(num % x, num % y)`. The values of `num`, `x`, and `y` are derived from the first tuple in `test_cases`, which is `(n, x, y, arr)`. Therefore, `current_key` becomes `(n % x, n % y)`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `residue_map` is an empty dictionary; `arr` is the list from the first tuple in `test_cases`; `r_x` is 2; `r_y` is `x % y`; `current_key` is `(n % x, n % y)`**.
