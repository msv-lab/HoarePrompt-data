### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to determine if the program correctly identifies and counts the number of beautiful pairs as per the problem description.

#### Problem Recap:
A pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\), which can be rewritten as \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\), which can be rewritten as \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\).

#### Program Analysis:
The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the counts of residue pairs \((a_i \% x, a_i \% y)\) as it iterates through the array. For each element `num` in the array, it calculates:
- `r_x = -num % x`
- `r_y = num % y`

The key idea is to check if the pair \((r_x, r_y)\) has been seen before. If it has, it means there are previous elements that can form a beautiful pair with the current element `num`.

#### Annotations and Logic:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `residue_map` is initialized as an empty dictionary for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Number**:
   - For each number `num` in the array `arr`:
     - It calculates `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y`.
     - It checks if the pair \((r_x, r_y)\) exists in `residue_map`. If it does, it adds the count of this pair to the `count` variable.
     - It updates `residue_map` with the pair \((num % x, num % y)\), incrementing its count by 1.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all numbers in the array, it appends the `count` of beautiful pairs to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

#### Verification:
- **Condition 1**: \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) implies \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\).
  - The program correctly calculates `r_x = -num % x` to check for this condition.
- **Condition 2**: \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\) implies \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\).
  - The program correctly calculates `r_y = num % y` to check for this condition.

The logic used in the program is correct. By checking if the pair \((r_x, r_y)\) has been seen before, the program effectively counts the number of beautiful pairs.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. The annotations support the program's correctness, and there are no apparent issues in the logic or implementation.

**Final: True**
