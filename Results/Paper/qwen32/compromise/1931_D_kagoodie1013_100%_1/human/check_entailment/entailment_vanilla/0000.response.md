Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis

We need to find pairs of indices \((i, j)\) in the array \(a\) such that:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The program reads multiple test cases, each with an array \(a\) and integers \(x\) and \(y\). For each test case, it needs to determine the number of such beautiful pairs.

### Program Analysis

The program's core logic is implemented in the `func_1` function. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes a `results` list to store the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes a `residue_map` dictionary to keep track of the counts of certain residue pairs.

2. **Processing Each Number**:
   - For each number `num` in the array `arr`, it calculates two residues:
     - `r_x = -num % x`
     - `r_y = num % y`
   - It then checks if the pair \((r_x, r_y)\) exists in the `residue_map`. If it does, it adds the count of this pair to the `count` variable.
   - It updates the `residue_map` with the pair \((num % x, num % y)\), incrementing its count by 1.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all numbers in the array, it appends the `count` of beautiful pairs to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Correctness Verification

Let's verify if the program correctly identifies beautiful pairs:

- **Condition 1**: \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
  - This can be rewritten as \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\). Thus, `r_x = -num % x` is the correct residue to check for.
  
- **Condition 2**: \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).
  - This can be rewritten as \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\). Thus, `r_y = num % y` is the correct residue to check for.
  
- **Counting Pairs**:
  - The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of how many times each residue pair \((num % x, num % y)\) has been seen.
  - When processing each number `num`, it checks if the pair \((-num % x, num % y)\) exists in `residue_map` to find pairs that satisfy both conditions.
  - If such a pair exists, it increments the count by the number of times that pair has been seen.

The logic correctly identifies and counts the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
