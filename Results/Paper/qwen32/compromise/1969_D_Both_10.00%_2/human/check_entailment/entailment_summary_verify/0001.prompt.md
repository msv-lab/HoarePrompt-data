You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

- Program:
import heapq
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    return int(putin())

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    return map(int, putin().split())

#Function 3:
def func_3(main_ar, sec_arr):
    sub_summ = 0
    for val_a in sec_arr:
        sub_summ += val_a[0]
    for val_b in main_ar:
        if val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0:
            sub_summ += val_b[0] + val_b[1]
    return sub_summ



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function accepts two lists of tuples, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, where each tuple contains two integers. It calculates a sum, `sub_summ`, by adding the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` and then adding the sum of the two integers in each tuple of `main_ar` only if that sum is greater than or equal to 0. The function returns the final calculated sum, `sub_summ`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem description to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Alice wants to maximize her profit, and Bob wants to minimize it.
2. **Profit Calculation**: Alice's profit is the sum of what Bob pays her minus the sum of what she spent.
3. **Bob's Behavior**: 
   - If Alice buys less than `k` items, Bob takes all of them for free.
   - If Alice buys `k` or more items, Bob takes `k` items for free and pays for the rest.
4. **Strategy**:
   - Alice should buy items where `b_i - a_i` is positive or zero to maximize her profit.
   - Bob will take the `k` items with the highest `b_i - a_i` for free to minimize Alice's profit.

### Code Analysis:
Let's break down the provided code:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: Reads an integer from input.
2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: Reads a line of integers from input.
3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function seems to be calculating the profit, but there are several issues:
   - It sums up all values in `sec_arr` without any condition.
   - It sums up values in `main_ar` only if `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`. However, this condition is not correctly reflecting the problem's logic.
   - The function does not handle the selection of `k` items by Bob.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Profit Calculation**: The function `func_3` does not correctly implement the logic for calculating Alice's profit based on Bob's strategy.
2. **Lack of `k` Handling**: The function does not account for Bob's choice of `k` items to take for free.
3. **Input Handling**: The code assumes the existence of a `putin()` function, which is not defined in the provided code. It should be `sys.stdin.readline()` or similar.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Pairing and Sorting**: Pair each item's prices `(a_i, b_i)` and sort them based on `b_i - a_i` in descending order.
2. **Profit Calculation**:
   - If Alice buys less than `k` items, her profit is zero (Bob takes all for free).
   - If Alice buys `k` or more items, calculate the profit by summing the values of `b_i - a_i` for items Bob does not take for free (i.e., after the first `k` items).

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
