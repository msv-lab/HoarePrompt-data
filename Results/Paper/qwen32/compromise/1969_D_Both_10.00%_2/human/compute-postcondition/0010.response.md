The value of `sub_summ` is incremented by the sum of the first two elements of the tuple `val_b`. Given that `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, `sub_summ` will increase by a non-negative value. The other variables (`main_ar`, `sec_arr`, and `val_b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples, `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus `val_b[0] + val_b[1]`. The current value of `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` is greater than or equal to 0.**
