The code snippet `sub_summ += val_a[0]` increments the value of `sub_summ` by the value of the first element in `val_a`, which is the third tuple in `sec_arr`.

Given that `sub_summ` was initially `val_a[0] + val_a[0]` (which simplifies to `2 * val_a[0]`), after the code execution, `sub_summ` will be `2 * val_a[0] + val_a[0]`, which simplifies to `3 * val_a[0]`.

Therefore, the updated output state is:
Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `sub_summ` is `3 * val_a[0]`, `val_a` is the third tuple in `sec_arr`.**
