You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided code and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:** 
   - Multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, we get two integers `n` and `k`, and an array `a` of length `2n`.
   - Array `a` consists of each integer from `1` to `n` exactly twice.
   - We need to find two arrays `l` and `r` of length `2k` such that:
     - `l` is a subset of the first `n` elements of `a`.
     - `r` is a subset of the last `n` elements of `a`.
     - The XOR of elements in `l` equals the XOR of elements in `r`.
   
2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output two lines:
     - The first line contains the elements of `l`.
     - The second line contains the elements of `r`.

#### Approach Analysis:
- The code first reads the number of test cases `T`.
- For each test case:
  - It reads `n` and `k`.
  - It reads the array `a` and splits it into two halves: `lft` (first `n` elements) and `rgt` (last `n` elements).
  - It initializes three lists: `ldb` (to store elements that appear twice in `lft`), `rdb` (to store elements that appear twice in `rgt`), and `sng` (to store elements that appear only once in `lft`).
  - It sorts `lft` and `rgt`.
  - It populates `ldb` with elements that appear twice in `lft` and `rdb` with elements that appear twice in `rgt`.
  - It also populates `sng` with elements that appear only once in `lft`.
  - It then tries to construct `l` and `r` by:
    - Adding pairs of elements from `ldb` to `l` and `r` until it reaches `k` elements or exhausts `ldb`.
    - Adding elements from `sng` to `l` and `r` until it reaches `k` elements or exhausts `sng`.

#### Issues in the Code:
- The code does not ensure that `r` is a subset of the second `n` elements of `a`.
  - It uses the same `sng` list for both `l` and `r`, which might lead to elements being included in both `l` and `r` that are not in the correct halves of `a`.
- The code does not guarantee that the XOR of `l` and `r` will be equal.
  - Adding elements from `sng` to both `l` and `r` without considering the XOR effect might not yield the required condition.
- The code does not handle all cases correctly, especially when `k > 1` and the XOR condition is complex.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly solve the problem as it does not ensure that `l` and `r` are subsets of the correct halves of `a` and does not guarantee that their XOR values will be equal.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
