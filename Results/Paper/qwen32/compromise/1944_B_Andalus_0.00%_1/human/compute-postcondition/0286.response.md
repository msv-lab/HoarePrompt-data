Let's break down the given information and analyze the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from the `rgt` list.
- `ldb` contains at least one element.
- `sz` is less than `k` with the additional condition that `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` prints the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, and does not move to the next line at the end (due to `end=' '`).

However, the variable `elem` is not defined in the initial state provided. This means we don't have a specific value for `elem`. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of `elem`.

### Output Description:
Since `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of `elem`. The print statement will output the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, on the same line.

### Final Output:
Output: **elem elem (where elem is the value of the variable elem)**
