To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet step by step.

The initial state describes a complex set of variables and their relationships:
- `T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000.
- `n` is `input_n` and must be greater than 1.
- `k` is `input_k`.
- `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input.
- `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
- `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order and must contain at least one pair of adjacent duplicates.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have at least one duplicate next to them.
- `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have any duplicates next to them.
- `rdb` contains the elements from `rgt` that have at least one duplicate next to them and has more than one element.
- `sz` is either 0 or greater than or equal to `k`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.

The provided code snippet is:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

The key to understanding the output is the variable `elem`. However, `elem` is not defined in the initial state or the provided code snippet. Therefore, we need to infer where `elem` might be coming from. Given the context, `elem` is likely to be an element from one of the lists (`lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `sng`, `rdb`) that is being processed in a loop or condition that includes the `print` statement.

Since `elem` is not explicitly defined, we can infer that `elem` is a variable that holds a value from one of these lists during some iteration of a loop. For the purpose of this explanation, let's assume that `elem` is an element from `lft` or `rgt` that meets some condition in the loop.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```
This statement will print the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, and will not add a newline at the end (due to `end=' '`).

Since the exact value of `elem` is not provided, we can describe the output in terms of `elem`.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is an element from one of the lists `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `sng`, or `rdb` that is being processed in the loop)**
