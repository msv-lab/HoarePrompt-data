Output State: **`rdb` must contain at least one element, `sz` is 0, the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed, `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
