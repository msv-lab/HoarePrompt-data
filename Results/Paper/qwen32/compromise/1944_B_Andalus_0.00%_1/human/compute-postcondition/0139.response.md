Given the initial conditions and the Python code snippet, we can determine the new state of the variables after the code execution.

Initial State:
- `T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000.
- `n` is `input_n` and must be greater than 1.
- `k` is `input_k`.
- `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input.
- `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
- `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order.
- `i` is 3.
- `sz` is 3.
- If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is `[lft[2]]` and `sng` and `rdb` are both empty.
- If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is empty, `sng` is `[lft[i]]` if `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, otherwise `sng` is empty, and `rdb` is empty.

Code Snippet:
```python
ldb.append(lft[i])
```

Impact of the Code:
- The code appends `lft[i]` to the list `ldb`.
- Since `i` is 3, `lft[i]` is `lft[3]`.
- Therefore, `ldb` will now contain `lft[2]` if it was not empty initially, and `lft[3]` will be added to `ldb`.

Output State:
- `T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000.
- `n` is `input_n` and must be greater than 1.
- `k` is `input_k`.
- `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input.
- `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
- `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order.
- `i` is 3.
- `sz` is 3.
- If `lft[i]` was equal to `lft[i - 1]` initially, `ldb` is now `[lft[2], lft[3]]`.
- If `lft[i]` was not equal to `lft[i - 1]` initially, `ldb` is now `[lft[3]]`.
- `sng` and `rdb` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000; `n` is `input_n` and must be greater than 1; `k` is `input_k`; `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input; `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order; `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order; `i` is 3; `sz` is 3; if `lft[3]` was equal to `lft[2]` initially, `ldb` is now `[lft[2], lft[3]]`, otherwise `ldb` is now `[lft[3]]`; `sng` and `rdb` remain unchanged.**
