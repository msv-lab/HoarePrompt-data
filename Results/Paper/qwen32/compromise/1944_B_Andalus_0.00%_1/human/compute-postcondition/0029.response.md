To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the provided initial state and the outputs after the first 3 iterations.

Here's a summary of the loop's behavior:

- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`.
- For each `i`, it checks if `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`. If so, `lft[i]` is added to `ldb`.
- If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, `lft[i]` is added to `sng`.

After the loop completes all iterations, the following will be true:

- `ldb` will contain all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element.
- `sng` will contain all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element.
- `rdb` will remain an empty list.
- `i` will be `n - 1` after the loop completes.

Let's formally outline the final output state:

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end. `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element. `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element. `rdb` remains an empty list. `i` is `n - 1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `ldb` will have all the elements in `lft` that are repeated consecutively, `sng` will have all the unique elements in `lft` that are not part of a sequence of identical elements, and `rdb` will remain empty. The loop counter `i` will be at its final value of `n - 1`.
