The code snippet appends the element at index `i` of the list `lft` to the list `sng`. Therefore, `sng` will now contain the element `lft[i]` as its first (and only, initially) element. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T` must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing the element `lft[i]`, and `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`.**
