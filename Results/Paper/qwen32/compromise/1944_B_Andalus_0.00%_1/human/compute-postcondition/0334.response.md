The code snippet `sz += 2` increments the value of `sz` by 2. Given that `sz` is either 0 or 2 initially, after executing this line, `sz` will be either 2 or 4. No other variable is affected by this operation.

Output State: **`rdb` must contain at least one element, `sz` is either 2 or 4, and the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed. `elem` is the next element in `rdb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
