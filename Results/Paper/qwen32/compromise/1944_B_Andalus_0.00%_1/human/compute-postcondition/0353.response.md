To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(elem, end=' ')`, we need to analyze the initial state and the context provided.

### Analysis:
1. **`rdb`**: This is a list or some iterable that has been processed. The processing involves reaching a point where `sz` reaches `k` or the end of `rdb` is reached.
2. **`sz`**: This variable is defined as the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus 1.
3. **`sng`**: The first `k` elements of `sng` have already been printed.
4. **`elem`**: This variable is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is used in the print statement. Given the context, `elem` is likely an element from the `sng` list or `rdb` list that is being processed at the current point in the loop or block of code.

### Conclusion:
Since `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can infer that `elem` is a variable that holds the current element being processed in the loop or block of code. The exact value of `elem` would depend on the iteration or the specific point in the code where the `print` statement is executed.

However, based on the information provided, we can describe the output in terms of `elem`.

### Output:
Output: **elem (where elem is the current element being processed in the loop or block of code)**
