The only object in the loop head is the variable `elem`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the list `ldb`. If there are more elements in `ldb` after the current `elem`, the loop will execute again with the next element in `ldb`.

At the end of the last iteration, `elem` is the second element of `ldb`. For the loop to execute one more time, `elem` should be the next element in `ldb` after the current `elem`.

Let's denote the elements of `ldb` as `ldb[0], ldb[1], ldb[2], ...`. Given that `elem` is currently `ldb[1]`, for the next iteration, `elem` should be `ldb[2]`.

State: **`T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least two elements, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of the previous element, `i` is `n` - 1, `elem` is the third element of `ldb`. If `k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is incremented by 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` after the increment, `sz` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains as described in the precondition. If `k - sz < 2`, the state of the variables remains unchanged as described in the precondition.**

However, since `elem` is the only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment, the final state can be simplified to:

State: **`T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least two elements, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of the previous element, `i` is `n` - 1, `elem` is the third element of `ldb`.**

Since the other variables are not part of the loop head and do not need adjustment, we can further simplify to:

State: **`elem` is the third element of `ldb`.**
