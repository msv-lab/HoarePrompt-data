The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3. The value of `n` must remain greater than 3 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3**
