To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the provided initial state and the code snippet:

- `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from the `rgt` list.
- `sz` is defined as `k + 2` (or the largest even number less than `k` plus 2 if `k` is odd and all elements in `ldb` have been processed).
- `sng` must have at least three elements.
- `elem` is the second element in `sng`.
- If `sz >= k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `sng` has at least three elements.
- `elem` is the second element in `sng`.

However, the exact values of the elements in `sng` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `elem`. We can only describe it in terms of its position in `sng`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the second element of the list `sng`, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Output: **elem (where elem is the second element of the list `sng`)**
