Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `rdb` must contain at least one element.
2. `sz` is 0.
3. The first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed.
4. `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2.
5. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement is printing the variable `elem` twice, separated by a space, and the `end` parameter is set to a space, meaning the next print statement (if any) would continue on the same line, separated by a space.
- The variable `elem` is not explicitly defined in the provided initial state, so we must infer its value based on the context.

### Inferences:
- Since the initial state mentions that the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed, it is reasonable to infer that `elem` is likely an element from the list `sng`.
- The loop or condition involving `sz` and `k` suggests that `elem` is being iterated over, and `sz` is likely a counter or index that is being incremented.

### Conclusion:
Given that `elem` is an element from the list `sng` and the print statement is executed within a loop or condition that iterates over `sng`, we can conclude that `elem` will be some value from the list `sng`.

Since the exact value of `elem` is not specified and depends on the current iteration, we can describe the output in terms of `elem`:

Output: **elem elem (where elem is an element from the list `sng`)**
