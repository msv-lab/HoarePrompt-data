To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`rdb`**: This list contains all consecutive duplicate elements from the `rgt` list. For example, if `rgt` is `[1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4]`, then `rdb` might be `[2, 2, 4, 4, 4]`.
2. **`sz`**: This variable is initially set to `k` (or the largest even number less than `k` if `k` is odd and all elements in `ldb` have been processed). The exact value of `sz` is not provided, but it is relevant to the loop control.
3. **`sng`**: This list must have at least one element, but its contents are not specified.
4. **Loop Control**: The loop will break if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, the loop continues.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing the variable `elem` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
- The variable `elem` is not defined in the provided initial state, so we need to infer its value from the context. Typically, `elem` would be an element from a list that is being iterated over in a loop.

### Inference:
Given that `rdb` contains consecutive duplicates from `rgt`, and `elem` is printed in a loop, it is reasonable to assume that `elem` is an element from `rdb`.

### Output:
Since `elem` is an element from `rdb` and `rdb` contains consecutive duplicates from `rgt`, the `print` statement will print each element of `rdb` followed by a space, until the loop condition is met (i.e., `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`).

However, without the exact elements of `rdb`, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements from `rdb`.

### Final Output:
Output: **elem (where elem is an element from the list rdb)**

If we had the specific elements of `rdb`, we could list them explicitly. For example, if `rdb` was `[2, 2, 4, 4, 4]`, the output would be `2 2 4 4 4 ` (with spaces between each element). But based on the given information, the most precise description is as follows:

Output: **elem (where elem is an element from the list rdb)**
