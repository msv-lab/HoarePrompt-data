The only object in the loop head is the variable `elem`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `sng`. If `sng` has more elements, the loop will execute again for the next element in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `sng` contains at least one element, and `elem` is the last element that was processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must have at least one more element that hasn't been processed yet.

Thus, `elem` should be the next element in `sng` after the last processed element.

State: **`T` is an integer such that T is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least three elements, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element and must contain at least two elements, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of the previous element, `i` is `n - 1`, `sz` is 7. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `elem` is the next element in `sng` after the last processed element.**
