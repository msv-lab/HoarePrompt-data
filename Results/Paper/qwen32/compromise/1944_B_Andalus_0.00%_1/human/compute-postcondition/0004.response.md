The code snippet `lft = lst[:n]` creates a new list `lft` that contains the first `n` elements of the list `lst`. The values of `T`, `t`, `n`, `k`, and the remaining elements of `lst` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T` must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.**
