Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is `input_n` and must be greater than 1, `k` is `input_k`, `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order, `i` is `n-1`, `sz` is 0, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have at least one duplicate next to them, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have any duplicates next to them, and `rdb` contains the elements from `rgt` that have at least one duplicate next to them.
Code of the loop:
for elem in ldb:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    if k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is `input_n` and must be greater than 1, `k` is `input_k`, `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order, `i` is `n-1`, `ldb` contains at least one element from `lft` that has at least one duplicate next to it, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have any duplicates next to them, `rdb` contains the elements from `rgt` that have at least one duplicate next to them`. If `k - sz >= 2`, then the current value of `k - (sz + 2)` is greater than or equal to 2. Otherwise, there is no change in the conditions related to `sz`, `k`, and the lists `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `sng`, and `rdb`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is `input_n` and must be greater than 1, `k` is `input_k`, `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order, `i` is `n-1`, `ldb` contains at least one element from `lft` that has at least one duplicate next to it, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have any duplicates next to them, `rdb` contains the elements from `rgt` that have at least one duplicate next to them`. If `sz >= k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, there is no change in the conditions related to `sz`, `k`, and the lists `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `sng`, and `rdb`. `elem` is the next element in `ldb` after `elem_current`. If `k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is increased by 2. Otherwise, there is no change in `sz`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is `input_n` and must be greater than 1, `k` is `input_k`, `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order, `i` is `n-1`, `ldb` contains at least one element from `lft` that has at least one duplicate next to it, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have any duplicates next to them, `rdb` contains the elements from `rgt` that have at least one duplicate next to them`. If `k - sz >= 2`, `elem` is the next element in `ldb` after the previous `elem` and `sz` is the previous value of `sz` plus 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `k - sz < 2`, `elem` remains the same and `sz` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
