To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and deduce the value of `elem`.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`rdb`**: This is a list or some iterable that has been processed up to the point where `sz` reaches `k` or the end of `rdb` is reached.
2. **`sz`**: This is the largest even number less than or equal to `k`.
3. **`k`**: This is a given number up to which `sz` is calculated.
4. **`sng`**: This list contains at least one element, and the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed.
5. **`elem`**: This variable is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but based on the context, it is likely an element from `sng` that is being printed.

### Key Points:
- The code is currently inside a loop where `elem` is being processed and printed.
- The loop breaks if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, but this does not affect the current `elem` being printed.
- The `end=' '` in the `print` statement means that after printing `elem`, a space will be added instead of a newline.

### Determining `elem`:
- Since the problem states that the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed, it implies that `elem` is one of these elements.
- However, the exact value of `elem` is not specified in the initial state. It could be any element from the first `k` elements of `sng`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the current value of `elem` followed by a space. Since the exact value of `elem` is not provided, we describe it as one of the first `k` elements of `sng`.

Output: **elem (where elem is one of the first k elements of the sng list)**
