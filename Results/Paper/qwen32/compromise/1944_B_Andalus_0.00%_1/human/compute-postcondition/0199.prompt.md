Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is `input_n` and must be greater than 1, `k` is `input_k`, `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order, `i` is `n-1`, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have at least one duplicate next to them, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have any duplicates next to them, `rdb` contains the elements from `rgt` that have at least one duplicate next to them`, and `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` if there are enough elements in `ldb` to reach that count, or the total number of elements printed from `ldb` if `k` is not reached.
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is `input_n` and must be greater than 1, `k` is `input_k`, `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order, `i` is `n-1`, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have at least one duplicate next to them, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have any duplicates next to them and must have at least one element, `rdb` contains the elements from `rgt` that have at least one duplicate next to them, and `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` if there are enough elements in `ldb` to reach that count, or the total number of elements printed from `ldb` if `k` is not reached, plus 1. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no specific action is taken for the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is `input_n` and must be greater than 1, `k` is `input_k`, `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order, `i` is `n-1`, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have at least one duplicate next to them, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have any duplicates next to them and must have at least one element, `rdb` contains the elements from `rgt` that have at least one duplicate next to them, `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` if there are enough elements in `ldb` to reach that count, or the total number of elements printed from `ldb` if `k` is not reached, plus 2, `elem` is the next element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is `input_n` and must be greater than 1, `k` is `input_k`, `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order, `i` is `n-1`, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have at least one duplicate next to them, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have any duplicates next to them and must have at least one element, `rdb` contains the elements from `rgt` that have at least one duplicate next to them, `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` if there are enough elements in `ldb` to reach that count, or the total number of elements printed from `ldb` if `k` is not reached, plus 3, `elem` is the next element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues to execute the code following the if-else block.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
