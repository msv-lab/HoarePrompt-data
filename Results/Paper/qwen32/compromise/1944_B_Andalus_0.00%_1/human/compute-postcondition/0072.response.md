To determine the output of the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the context in which `elem` is used.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **T**: An integer greater than or equal to 1.
2. **t**: An integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
3. **n**: The first integer from the input, greater than 1.
4. **k**: The second integer from the input.
5. **lst**: A list of integers obtained by splitting the input.
6. **lft**: A sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
7. **rgt**: A sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end.
8. **ldb**: Contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least three elements.
9. **sng**: Contains all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element and must contain at least two elements.
10. **rdb**: Contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of the previous element.
11. **i**: Set to `n - 1`.
12. **sz**: Set to 7.
13. **elem**: The next element in `sng` after the last processed element.

### Analysis:
- The variable `elem` is defined as the next element in the list `sng` after the last processed element. Since `sng` contains elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element, and it is given that `sng` must contain at least two elements, `elem` will be one of those elements.
- The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` followed by a space. The exact value of `elem` depends on the specific content of `sng`, which in turn depends on the content of the initial list `lst`.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact content of `lst` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `elem`. However, based on the structure of the problem, we know that `elem` is an element from the list `sng`, which contains elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element.

Thus, the output will be the next element in `sng` after the last processed element, followed by a space.

Output: **elem (where elem is the next element in the list sng after the last processed element)**
