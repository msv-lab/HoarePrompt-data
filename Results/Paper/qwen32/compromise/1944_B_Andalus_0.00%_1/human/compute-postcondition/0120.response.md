The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common placeholder for a loop variable that we do not use inside the loop) and `T`. The loop will execute as long as `T` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `T` must be decremented by 1, so `T` should now be `T - 1`.

State: **`T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is 3, `k` is 3, `lst` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], `lft` is [1, 2, 3], `rgt` is [4, 5], `ldb` is [], `sng` is [2, 3], `rdb` is [], `i` is 2, `sz` is 3**
