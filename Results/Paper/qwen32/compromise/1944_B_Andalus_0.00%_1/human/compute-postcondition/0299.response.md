The code snippet `sz += 2` increments the value of `sz` by 2. Given the initial state, `sz` is increased by 2 if `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `sz` remains unchanged. Since the code snippet directly increments `sz` by 2, we can infer that the condition `k - sz >= 2` was true, allowing the increment to occur.

Output State: **`rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from the `rgt` list, `ldb` contains at least one more element after `elem`, `sz` is increased by 2, `elem` is the next element in `ldb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
