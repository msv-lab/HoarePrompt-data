The given code snippet initializes the variable `sz` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains the same for all other variables as per the initial state.

Output State: **T is an integer such that T is greater than or equal to 1, t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, k is the second integer from the input, lst is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, lft is a sorted list containing the first n elements of lst, rgt is a sorted list containing the elements of lst from index n to the end, ldb contains all elements from lft that are duplicates of the previous element, sng contains all elements from lft that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element, rdb contains all elements from rgt that are duplicates of the previous element, i is n - 1, sz is 0.**
