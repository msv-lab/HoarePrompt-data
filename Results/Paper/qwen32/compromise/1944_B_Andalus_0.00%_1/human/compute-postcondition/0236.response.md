Postcondition: **`sz` is `min(k, 2*m) + 2`, `sng` is an iterable with at least one more element, and `elem` is the next element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program does nothing additional with respect to `sz`, `sng`, or `elem`.**
