The code snippet sorts the list `lft`. Therefore, the order of elements in `lft` will be updated to be in ascending order. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is `input_n`, `k` is `input_k`, `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is `lst[n:]`, `ldb` is [], `sng` is [], `rdb` is [], `i` is 2, `sz` is 3.**
