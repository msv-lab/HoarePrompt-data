Postcondition: **`rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from the `rgt` list, `sz` is equal to `k` (or the largest even number less than `k` if `k` is odd and all elements in `ldb` have been processed), `sng` must have at least one element. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no specific change is made to the variables.**
