Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an integer read from input, representing the number of test cases; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= floor(n/2), and `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lft = lst[:n]
    rgt = lst[n:]
    ldb = []
    rdb = []
    sng = []
    lft.sort()
    rgt.sort()
    for i in range(1, n):
        if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
            ldb.append(lft[i])
        elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
            sng.append(lft[i])
    for i in range(1, n):
        if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:
            rdb.append(rgt[i])
    sz = 0
    for elem in ldb:
        if sz >= k:
            break
        if k - sz >= 2:
            print(elem, elem, end=' ')
            sz += 2
    for elem in sng:
        if sz >= k:
            break
        print(elem, end=' ')
        sz += 1
    print()
    sz = 0
    for elem in rdb:
        if sz >= k:
            break
        if k - sz >= 2:
            print(elem, elem, end=' ')
            sz += 2
    for elem in sng:
        if sz >= k:
            break
        print(elem, end=' ')
        sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is an integer such that T is greater than or equal to 1, t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n is 3, k is 3, lst is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], lft is [1, 2, 3], rgt is [4, 5], ldb is [], sng is [2, 3], rdb is [], i is 2, sz is 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `sz` is `min(k, len(sng) + min(k, 2*m))`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `rdb` has been processed up to the point where `sz` reaches `k` or the end of `rdb` is reached, `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus the number of iterations that have occurred, and the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed. If `sz >= k`, the loop exits.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
