Postcondition: **`T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of the previous element, `i` is `n` - 1, `ldb` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the first element of `ldb`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is increased by 2. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains as described in the precondition.**
