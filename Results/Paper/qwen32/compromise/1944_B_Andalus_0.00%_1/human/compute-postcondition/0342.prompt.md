Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt`, `sz` is 0, and the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed.
Code of the loop:
for elem in rdb:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    if k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `rdb` must contain at least one element, `sz` is either 0 or 2, and the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is set to 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `rdb` must contain at least one element, `sz` is either 0, 2, or 4, and the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed. `elem` is the next element in `rdb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is updated to either 2 or 4.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `rdb` must contain at least one element, `sz` is either 0, 2, 4, or 6, and the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed. `elem` is the next element in `rdb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to the state of the program. If `k - sz` is at least 2, then `sz` is increased by 2. Otherwise, no changes are made to the state of the program.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
