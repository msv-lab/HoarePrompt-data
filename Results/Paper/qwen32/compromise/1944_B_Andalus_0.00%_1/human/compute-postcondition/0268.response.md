To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables `ldb` and `sng`.

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. For each iteration `i`:
- If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i-1]`, `lft[i]` is added to `ldb`.
- If `i < n-1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i+1]`, `lft[i]` is added to `sng`.

This means:
- `ldb` will contain all elements in `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element.
- `sng` will contain all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their adjacent elements (both previous and next).

After the loop completes, `ldb` will have all the duplicate elements from `lft` (except the last occurrence of each duplicate), and `sng` will have all the unique elements in `lft` that are not adjacent to identical elements.

Let's summarize the final state in the required format.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `sz` is `min(k, len(sng) + min(k, 2*m))`, `T` is at least 1, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a sorted list of the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their adjacent elements (both previous and next).**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes:
- `ldb` will have all the duplicate elements from the first `n` sorted elements of `lst` (except the last occurrence of each duplicate).
- `sng` will have all the unique elements in the first `n` sorted elements of `lst` that are not adjacent to identical elements.
- `rdb` remains an empty list.
- The other variables (`n`, `k`, `sz`, `T`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`) remain unchanged from their initial state except for `sng` and `ldb` as described.
