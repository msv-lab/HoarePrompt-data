### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking specific conditions and calculating the prices of the stalls. However, the logic used in the program is flawed and does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels with the given constraints. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Initial Conditions Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n == k` by setting up a single stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel.
   - It also correctly handles the case where `n < k` by printing "NO" because Alice cannot afford to buy `k` jewels.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program initializes the `costs` list with two values: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - It then calculates `curr` as `n // i` for each cost `i` in `costs` and updates `h` (the total number of jewels Alice buys) and `n` (the remaining coins).
   - The logic here is flawed because it does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. The program only considers two prices (`n - k + 1` and `1`), which is not sufficient to cover all possible scenarios.

3. **Final Check**:
   - The program checks if `h < k` and prints "NO" if true, otherwise it prints "YES" and the prices.
   - The issue here is that the logic for determining the prices and the number of jewels bought is incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**

### Explanation of a Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, Bob can set up stalls with prices that allow Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels. One possible approach is to use binary search to find the maximum number of jewels Alice can buy with a given price limit and then adjust the prices accordingly.

Here is an example of a correct approach:

```python
def can_buy_exactly_k_jewels(n, k):
    if n == k:
        print("YES")
        print(1)
        print(1)
        return
    if n < k:
        print("NO")
        return
    
    prices = []
    remaining_jewels = k
    remaining_coins = n
    
    for i in range(1, 61):
        if remaining_jewels == 0:
            break
        max_price = remaining_coins // remaining_jewels
        if max_price == 0:
            break
        num_jewels = remaining_coins // max_price
        if num_jewels > remaining_jewels:
            num_jewels = remaining_jewels
        prices.append(max_price)
        remaining_jewels -= num_jewels
        remaining_coins -= num_jewels * max_price
    
    if remaining_jewels == 0:
        print("YES")
        print(len(prices))
        print(*prices)
    else:
        print("NO")

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    can_buy_exactly_k_jewels(n, k)
```

This approach ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by iteratively setting up stalls with the maximum possible price that allows her to buy the remaining jewels.
