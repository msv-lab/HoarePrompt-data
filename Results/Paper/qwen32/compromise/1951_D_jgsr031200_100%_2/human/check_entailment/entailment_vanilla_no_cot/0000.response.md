Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. The main issue is the logic used to determine the prices of the stalls and the number of stalls required to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Logic for Determining Prices**: The program uses a hardcoded list of prices `[n - k + 1, 1]` and attempts to calculate how many jewels Alice can buy with these prices. This approach is too simplistic and does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.

2. **Handling General Cases**: The program does not handle the general case where more than two stalls might be needed. It does not provide a systematic way to determine the prices and the number of stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if `n` is much larger than `k`, the program might not be able to find a combination of prices that results in Alice buying exactly `k` jewels.

To solve the problem correctly, Bob can use a strategy where he sets up stalls with prices that are powers of 2 (or other strategic values) to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. This approach leverages the fact that Alice buys greedily and will buy as many jewels as possible at each stall before moving to the next stall.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    if k > n:
        print('NO')
        continue
    
    # Try to use powers of 2 as prices
    stalls = []
    remaining_k = k
    current_price = 1
    
    while remaining_k > 0:
        if remaining_k & 1:  # If the least significant bit is 1
            stalls.append(current_price)
        remaining_k >>= 1  # Shift right to check the next bit
        current_price *= 2
    
    if len(stalls) > 60:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(len(stalls))
        print(*stalls)
```

This program uses a binary representation of `k` to determine the prices of the stalls. Each bit in the binary representation of `k` corresponds to a stall with a price that is a power of 2. This ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, as each bit set in `k` corresponds to a stall where Alice buys one jewel.
