Reasoning:

The provided Python program is intended to solve the problem as described. However, the logic implemented in the function `func_1` is incorrect and does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels with the given constraints.

The function `func_1` contains the following issues:
1. It only considers two costs `[n - k + 1, 1]` and checks if the total number of jewels Alice can buy with these costs meets or exceeds `k`. This is not sufficient to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
2. The approach does not utilize the maximum number of stalls (up to 60) that Bob can set up and does not ensure that Alice will spend her coins optimally across multiple stalls.
3. The program does not handle the case where `n` is greater than `k` and `n - k + 1` is not a suitable price to make Alice buy exactly `k` jewels.

To correctly solve the problem, Bob should set up multiple stalls with prices such that Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels. One possible strategy is to use binary representation or a greedy approach to distribute the cost of jewels across stalls.

Given the issues in the current implementation, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
