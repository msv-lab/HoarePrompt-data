Let's break down the given initial state and the variables to understand what will be printed.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` remains unchanged (its value is not specified, but it is used in the calculations).
   - `costs` is a list defined as `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - `h` is defined as `k + 1` and is not less than `k` (this information about `h` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task).

2. **Calculating the `costs` list:**
   - Given `n` is 0, the expression `n - k + 1` becomes `0 - k + 1`, which simplifies to `1 - k`.
   - Therefore, the `costs` list is `[1 - k, 1]`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(*costs)` statement will print the elements of the `costs` list separated by spaces.

Given the above calculations, the output will be the elements of the `costs` list.

Output: **1 - k, 1 (where k is the unchanged value of k)**
