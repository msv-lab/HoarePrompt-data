Given the initial state, we have two variables `n` and `k`, both of which are positive integers and are currently equal to each other. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print(1)
```

This `print` statement explicitly outputs the integer `1`, regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.

So, based on the code snippet provided, the output will be:

Output: **1**
