You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        print('bob  ')
    else:
        print('alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and a and b are the integers from the last test case, where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        print('bob  ')
        #This is printed: bob
    else :
        print('alice')
        #This is printed: alice
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `a` and `b` are integers from the last test case, where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9. The sum of `a` and `b` is either even or odd.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program and compare it with the problem requirements step-by-step:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the first line of input.
   - For each test case, it reads a line containing two integers `a` and `b`, which represent the number of coins Alice and Bob have, respectively.

2. **Logic to Determine the Winner**:
   - The program checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even, it prints "bob".
   - If the sum is odd, it prints "alice".

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - The output for each test case is printed immediately after reading and processing the test case.
   - However, there is an issue with the output formatting: the program prints "bob  " with a trailing space, which does not match the expected output format. It should print "Bob" without any trailing spaces.

4. **Optimal Play**:
   - The provided solution uses the parity (even or odd nature) of the sum of coins to determine the winner. This is based on the observation that if the total number of coins is even, Bob wins, and if it is odd, Alice wins.
   - This observation is correct based on the game rules and optimal play strategies.

5. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - The logic of checking the parity of the sum of coins and determining the winner is correct.
   - However, the output formatting issue makes the program incorrect for the given problem description.

Given the above analysis, the program's logic is correct, but the output formatting is incorrect. Since the problem specifies that the output should match exactly, including spacing, the program is not considered correct.

**Correctness: False**
