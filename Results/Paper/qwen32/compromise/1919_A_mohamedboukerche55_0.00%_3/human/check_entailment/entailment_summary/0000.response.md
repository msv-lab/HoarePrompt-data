Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly handle the logic for determining the winner based on the game rules. The main issue is that the program only outputs the result for the last test case instead of handling each test case individually. Additionally, the output strings include extra spaces which do not match the required output format. The logic for determining the winner based on the sum of `a` and `b` being even or odd is also incorrect according to the problem statement.

The correct logic should involve analyzing the game state for each test case independently and determining the winner based on optimal play. The optimal strategy in this game revolves around whether the total number of coins (a + b) is odd or even. If the total number of coins is odd, Alice wins because she can always force Bob into a losing position. If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins because Alice will eventually run out of moves first if both play optimally.

However, the given program does not properly handle multiple test cases and includes extraneous spaces in the output, making it incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
