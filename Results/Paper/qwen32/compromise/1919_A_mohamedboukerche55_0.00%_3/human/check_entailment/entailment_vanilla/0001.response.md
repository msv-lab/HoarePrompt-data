Let's analyze the given Python program and compare it with the problem requirements step-by-step:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the first line of input.
   - For each test case, it reads a line containing two integers `a` and `b`, which represent the number of coins Alice and Bob have, respectively.

2. **Logic to Determine the Winner**:
   - The program checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even, it prints "bob".
   - If the sum is odd, it prints "alice".

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - The output for each test case is printed immediately after reading and processing the test case.
   - However, there is an issue with the output formatting: the program prints "bob  " with a trailing space, which does not match the expected output format. It should print "Bob" without any trailing spaces.

4. **Optimal Play**:
   - The provided solution uses the parity (even or odd nature) of the sum of coins to determine the winner. This is based on the observation that if the total number of coins is even, Bob wins, and if it is odd, Alice wins.
   - This observation is correct based on the game rules and optimal play strategies.

5. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - The logic of checking the parity of the sum of coins and determining the winner is correct.
   - However, the output formatting issue makes the program incorrect for the given problem description.

Given the above analysis, the program's logic is correct, but the output formatting is incorrect. Since the problem specifies that the output should match exactly, including spacing, the program is not considered correct.

**Correctness: False**
