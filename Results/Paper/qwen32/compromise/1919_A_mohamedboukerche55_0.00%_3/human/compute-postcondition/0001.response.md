The provided loop reads `t` test cases from the input, where each test case consists of two integers `a` and `b`. The loop processes each test case by reading a line of input, splitting it into two parts, converting those parts to integers, and assigning them to `a` and `b` respectively. However, the values of `a` and `b` are not stored or used outside of the loop, so after the loop completes, the values of `a` and `b` from the last test case will be the only ones retained.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and a and b are the integers from the last test case, where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.**
