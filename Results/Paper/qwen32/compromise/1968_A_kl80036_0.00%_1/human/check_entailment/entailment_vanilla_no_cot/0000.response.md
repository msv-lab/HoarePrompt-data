To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it always finds an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

The program currently selects \( y \) as \( x // 2 \) for each test case. This choice does not necessarily maximize \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for all values of \( x \).

Let's consider a few examples to illustrate this:

1. **Example with \( x = 10 \):**
   - The program suggests \( y = 10 // 2 = 5 \).
   - \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10 \).
   - However, if we try \( y = 6 \), then \( \gcd(10, 6) + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8 \).
   - If we try \( y = 9 \), then \( \gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10 \).
   - Both \( y = 5 \) and \( y = 9 \) yield the maximum value of 10, so \( y = 5 \) is correct in this case, but it's not guaranteed for all cases.

2. **Example with \( x = 7 \):**
   - The program suggests \( y = 7 // 2 = 3 \).
   - \( \gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4 \).
   - However, if we try \( y = 6 \), then \( \gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7 \).
   - \( y = 3 \) does not yield the maximum value; \( y = 6 \) does.

3. **Example with \( x = 21 \):**
   - The program suggests \( y = 21 // 2 = 10 \).
   - \( \gcd(21, 10) + 10 = 1 + 10 = 11 \).
   - However, if we try \( y = 18 \), then \( \gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 3 + 18 = 21 \).
   - \( y = 10 \) does not yield the maximum value; \( y = 18 \) does.

From these examples, it's clear that \( y = x // 2 \) does not always provide the correct \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

Therefore, the program is not correct for all possible inputs as described in the problem statement.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **False**
