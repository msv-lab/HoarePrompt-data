The given code snippet only initializes an empty list `ans`. No other variables are modified, and no computations are performed. Therefore, the state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is an empty list.**
