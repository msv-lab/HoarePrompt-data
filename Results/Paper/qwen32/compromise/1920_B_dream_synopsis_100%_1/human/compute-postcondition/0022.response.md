The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed (now descending) list of `n` integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing two elements `[sums, sums]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`**

In natural language, this means that `ans` now contains two elements, both of which are equal to `sums`, while all other variables retain their original values.
