Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed (now descending) list of `n` integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element `sums`, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `sums` is equal to `a[i - 1]`.**
