Let's analyze the given code snippet and determine its impact on the variables:

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers with `k` being at least 0
- `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`
- `i` is 4
- `sums` is updated to `sums + a[3]`
- If `i == 0`, `ans` is a list containing the values `[sums, sums]` where `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing the original value of `sums` and the updated value of `sums`.
- If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[2] - 2 * a[x + 2]`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[2]`.

Given Code Snippet:
```python
ans.append(sums)
```

Impact of the Code:
- The code appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`.

Since `i` is 4, the condition `i == 0` is not met, so `ans` initially contains the original value of `sums` and the updated value of `sums` (which is `sums + a[3]`).
After appending `sums` again, `ans` will contain three elements: the original value of `sums`, the updated value of `sums` (which is `sums + a[3]`), and the value of `sums` after the second update.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers with `k` being at least 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is 4, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[2] - 2 * a[x + 2]` if `i + x - 1 < n` otherwise `sums` is updated to `sums + a[2]`, `ans` is a list containing the original value of `sums`, the updated value of `sums` (which is `sums + a[3]`), and the final value of `sums` after the second update.**
