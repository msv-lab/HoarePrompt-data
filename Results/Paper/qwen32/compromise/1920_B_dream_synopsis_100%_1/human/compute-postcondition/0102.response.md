The code appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` and the newly calculated `sums`, `i` is incremented by 1, `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
