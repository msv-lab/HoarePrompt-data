Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state:

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers with `k` being at least 0
- `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`
- `i` is 4
- `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`
- If `i == 0`, `ans` is a list containing the values `[sums, sums]`. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing the original value of `sums` and the updated value of `sums`.
- If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[2] - 2 * a[x + 2]`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[2]`.

Code Snippet:
```python
ans.append(sums)
```

Impact Analysis:
- The code snippet appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`.
- No other variables are modified.

Since `i` is 4 (not 0), `ans` initially contains the original value of `sums`. After executing the code snippet, `ans` will contain the original value of `sums` followed by the current value of `sums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers with `k` being at least 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is 4, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `ans` is a list containing the original value of `sums` and the current value of `sums`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is: `t` remains the same, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain the same, `a` remains the same, `sum1` remains the same, `i` remains 4, `sums` remains `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and `ans` now contains two entries, both equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
