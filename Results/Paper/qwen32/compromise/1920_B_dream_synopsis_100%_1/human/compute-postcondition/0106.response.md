The code appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Therefore, the list `ans` now contains one more element, which is the value of `sums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` and possibly other previous sums, `i` is incremented by 1, `sums` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i - 1]`.**
