The given code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer within a specific range, `a` is a reversed list of `n` integers, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, and `ans` is a list with `k + 1` elements. However, the code snippet only affects `n`, `k`, and `x`.

Since the code does not modify `t`, `a`, `sum1`, or `ans`, these variables retain their initial values. Only `n`, `k`, and `x` are updated based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed (now descending) list of `n` integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements where each element is calculated based on the rules specified in the loop.**
