Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` and possibly other previous sums, `i` is `i + 1`, `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1]`, `ans` now includes the newly appended value of `sums`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `sums` has been added to the list `ans`. All other variables retain their previous values.
