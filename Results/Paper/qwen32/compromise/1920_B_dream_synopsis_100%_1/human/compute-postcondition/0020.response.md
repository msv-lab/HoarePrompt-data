To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is just `i`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(k + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input
- `a` is a reversed (now descending) list of `n` integers read from the input
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`
- `ans` is a list containing one element `sums`
- If `i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`
- If `i` is not 0, `sums` is updated as follows:
  - If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, then `sums` becomes `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`
  - Otherwise, `sums` becomes `a[i - 1]`

Since the only variable in the loop head is `i`, we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration.

Let's assume the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is `i_prev`. For the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed (now descending) list of `n` integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element `sums`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`**

However, since we don't know the exact value of `i_prev`, we can generalize it as:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed (now descending) list of `n` integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element `sums`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**

If we assume the previous value of `i` was `i`, then the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

So the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed (now descending) list of `n` integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element `sums`, `i` is `i + 1`**
