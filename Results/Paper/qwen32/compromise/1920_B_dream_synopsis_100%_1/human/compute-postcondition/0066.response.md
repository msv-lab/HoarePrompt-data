The code appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Given that `sums` is the old value of `sums` plus `a[2]`, and `ans` initially contains the value of `sums`, after appending, `ans` will now contain two elements: the original `sums` and the updated `sums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers with `k` being at least 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the original value of `sums` and the updated value of `sums`, `i` is 3, `sums` is the old value of `sums` plus `a[2]`.**
