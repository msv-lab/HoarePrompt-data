The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. This means that `ans` now contains two elements: the original element `sums + a[i - 1]` and the newly appended `sums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed (now descending) list of `n` integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing two elements `[sums + a[i - 1], sums]`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
