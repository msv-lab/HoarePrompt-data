Reasoning:
The given Python program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the three digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
2. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It then checks if the digits form a stair using the condition `a < b < c`. If this condition is true, it prints "STAIR".
4. If the digits do not form a stair, it checks if they form a peak using the condition `a < b and b > c`. If this condition is true, it prints "PEAK".
5. If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NONE".

The logic of the program matches the problem description perfectly:
- A "STAIR" is correctly identified when `a < b < c`.
- A "PEAK" is correctly identified when `a < b > c`.
- Any other combination results in "NONE".

Therefore, the program handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
