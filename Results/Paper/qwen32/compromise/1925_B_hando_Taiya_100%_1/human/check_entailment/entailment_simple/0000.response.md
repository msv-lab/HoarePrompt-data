### Reasoning:

To solve the problem, we need to find the maximum balance of a problemset, which is defined as the GCD of the difficulties of all sub-problems. The difficulties of all sub-problems must sum up to `x` and there must be exactly `n` sub-problems.

The key insight is that the maximum balance (GCD) can be achieved by choosing the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or by choosing the corresponding pair divisor `x // i` that is less than or equal to `n`. This is because the GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties should be as large as possible, and the largest possible GCD that divides `x` and can be repeated `n` times (or paired with another divisor to sum up to `x` and repeated `n` times) is what we are looking for.

The provided program iterates through all possible divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`. For each divisor `i`:
- It checks if `i` is a divisor of `x` (i.e., `x % i == 0`).
- It then checks if `i` or its corresponding pair divisor `x // i` can be the balance by verifying if they are less than or equal to `n`.
- It updates the answer `ans` to the maximum value found.

The final answer `ans` is printed for each test case.

### Correctness:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance by checking all possible divisors of `x` and ensuring that the divisor or its pair can be repeated `n` times. The program efficiently uses the property of divisors and the GCD to find the optimal solution.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
