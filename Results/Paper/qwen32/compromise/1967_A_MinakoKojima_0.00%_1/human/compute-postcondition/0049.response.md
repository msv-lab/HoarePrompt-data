The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1` (since the loop goes from 1 to `n-1`). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, but since `i` is already `n-1`, the next value of `i` would be `n`, which means the loop condition `i < n` would no longer be satisfied, and the loop would terminate.

However, to provide the state just before the loop terminates, we can state that `i` is `n-1` and `n` remains the same.

State: **`a` is updated such that `a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and `k` is the remaining value after all the updates; `ans` is `ans * (a[i] - a[i - 1])`; `n` must be greater than 1; `i` is `n-1`**
