Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the number of distinct types of cards, an integer `k` representing the number of coins, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` represents the number of cards of type `i` initially available. The function returns the result for each test case based on these inputs.**
