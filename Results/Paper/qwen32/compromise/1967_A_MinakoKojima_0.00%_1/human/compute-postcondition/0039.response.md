The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (let's denote it as `i_end`), and `n` must be greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.
- `k` is updated to `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.

The state at the start of the next iteration should have:
- `i` incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` remains the same since it does not change in the loop head.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we denote it as `i_end`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end + 1`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_end + 1`**.

However, since we do not know the exact value of `i_end`, we can generalize it to:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.
