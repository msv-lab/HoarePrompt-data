You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives input through standard input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8, 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2) where n is the size of the square grid and k is the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Grid and Diagonals**: 
   - We have a square grid of size `n x n`.
   - The total number of diagonals in this grid is `4n - 2`. These diagonals include both main and anti-diagonals of various lengths.

2. **Objective**:
   - Sasha wants to color the minimum number of cells such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - For the `n x n` grid, there are `2n - 1` diagonals running from top-left to bottom-right (main diagonals) and `2n - 1` diagonals running from top-right to bottom-left (anti-diagonals).
   - The longest diagonals in the grid have `n` cells, and the shortest diagonals have `1` cell.
   - To minimize the number of colored cells while covering the required number of diagonals, it's optimal to color cells in such a way that each colored cell covers as many diagonals as possible.

4. **Strategy**:
   - If `k` is equal to the total number of diagonals (`4n - 2`), then we need to color all diagonals. Since each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals (one main and one anti-diagonal), we need to color `ceil((4n - 2) / 2)` cells. This simplifies to `2n - 1` cells.
   - If `k` is less than `4n - 2`, we need to find the minimum number of cells such that at least `k` diagonals are covered. It can be shown that to cover `k` diagonals, we need to color `ceil(k / 2)` cells. This is because each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals.

### Program Analysis:

The provided solution follows the above strategy:

- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
- If `k` is equal to the total number of diagonals (`4n - 2`), it prints `(k // 2) + 1`.
- Otherwise, it prints `ceil(k / 2)`.

However, there's a mistake in the implementation of the first condition. When `k` is equal to `4n - 2`, the correct number of cells to color is `2n - 1`, not `(k // 2) + 1`.

### Conclusion:

The program is incorrect because it incorrectly calculates the number of cells to color when `k` is equal to `4n - 2`. The correct implementation should be:

```python
from math import ceil

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if 4 * n - 2 == k:
            print(2 * n - 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))

func()
```

Thus, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
