Reasoning:  
The program has several issues that prevent it from functioning correctly based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

1. **Function `func_1` Misinterpretation**:
   - According to the comments, `func_1` should take a tuple `(x, y)` representing coordinates and a tuple `(dx, dy)` representing movement deltas. It should return the new coordinates after applying the movement.
   - However, the comments incorrectly describe the function as concatenating strings, which is not the case. The function as implemented correctly returns the new coordinates `(x + dx, y + dy)`, but the comments are misleading and should be corrected.

2. **Handling of Throw Action**:
   - When a player throws the Quaffle (`T` action), the program checks if the player is on a goal (`players[mo[0]] in goals['R']` or `players[mo[0]] in goals['B']`). However, this check is flawed:
     - It does not correctly determine if the Quaffle is in the correct goal for the player's team.
     - It does not move the Quaffle back to the center of the field after a goal is scored.
     - It does not handle the case where a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal, which should score a point for the opposing team.
   - The correct implementation should:
     - Check if the player is on a goal (`players[mo[0]] in goals['R']` for a blue player or `players[mo[0]] in goals['B']` for a red player) to score a point for the correct team.
     - Print the appropriate goal message.
     - Move the Quaffle back to the center of the field.
     - Handle the case where a player scores in their own goal to award a point to the opposing team.

3. **Final Score Output**:
   - The final score is printed as `FINAL SCORE: pointsr pointsb`, which is correct. However, the points are not being updated correctly due to the incorrect handling of the throw action.

4. **Comments and Code Consistency**:
   - The comments and the actual code are inconsistent. The comments describe the function incorrectly, and the logic for handling the throw action is flawed.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as it does not handle all cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
