### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided program and the comments to determine if it correctly implements the solution as per the problem description.

1. **Initialization of Variables:**
   - The program initializes `players` as a dictionary to store the positions of all players.
   - `goals` is a dictionary to store the positions of the goals for each team.
   - `mouvements` is a dictionary that maps movement commands to their corresponding coordinate changes.
   - `pointsb` and `pointsr` are initialized to 0 to keep track of the scores for the blue and red teams, respectively.

2. **Reading the Field:**
   - The program reads the dimensions of the field `n` and `m`.
   - It then iterates over the next `n` lines, splitting each line into `m` pairs of characters.
   - Depending on the content of each pair, it updates the `players` dictionary or the `goals` list.

3. **Processing Moves:**
   - The program reads the number of moves `moves`.
   - It iterates over each move and checks the type of action:
     - If the action is a movement (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`), it updates the position of the player in the `players` dictionary using the `func_1` function.
     - If the action is a throw (`T`), it checks if the player is at a goal of the opposing team and updates the score accordingly.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a current position `(x, y)` and a movement `(dx, dy)`, and returns the new position `(x + dx, y + dy)`.
   - The comment associated with `func_1` incorrectly states that it returns a tuple of concatenated strings, but the actual implementation returns a tuple of integers, which is correct.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the score events as specified in the problem description.
   - At the end of the game, it prints the final score.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Comment for `func_1`:** While the function itself is implemented correctly, the comment describing its return value is incorrect. This is a minor issue and does not affect the correctness of the program's logic.
- **Missing `else` Clause for `if` Statements:** In the `if mo[1] == 'T'` block, there should be an `else` clause to handle the case where the player throws the Quaffle into their own goal. The current implementation only checks for goals of the opposing team, which means it does not correctly handle the scenario where a player scores in their own goal. This is a critical issue as it affects the correctness of the output.

### Correctness:
Given the critical issue with the `if mo[1] == 'T'` block not handling the scenario where a player scores in their own goal, the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.

**Correctness: False**
