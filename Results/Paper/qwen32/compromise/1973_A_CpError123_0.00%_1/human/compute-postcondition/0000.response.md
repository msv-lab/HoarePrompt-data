Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30, representing the scores of the three players in each test case. `resultats` is an empty list.**

In simple terms: The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive. The list `cas_de_test` retains its list of tuples, each containing three scores between 0 and 30. A new variable `resultats` is initialized as an empty list.
