In the given code snippet, the for loop iterates over `cas_de_test`, which is a list of tuples. For the loop to execute, `cas_de_test` must contain at least one tuple. The variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are unpacked from each tuple in `cas_de_test` during each iteration. Therefore, we need to ensure that `cas_de_test` has at least one tuple to allow the loop to execute.

The variable `t` represents the number of test cases and is an integer between 1 and 500. However, the presence of `t` does not directly affect the execution of the loop itself; it likely represents the number of tuples in `cas_de_test`. Since `t` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 500, it ensures that `cas_de_test` will have at least one tuple.

The variable `resultats` is an empty list and is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `cas_de_test` contains at least one tuple of three integers.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple, `resultats` is an empty list**
