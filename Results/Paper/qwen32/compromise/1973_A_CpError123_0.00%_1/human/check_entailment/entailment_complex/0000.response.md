Let's analyze the given program and its logic step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
- We need to find the maximum number of draws among the games played by three players, given their final scores.
- The scores are provided in non-decreasing order: \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).
- A draw gives 1 point to each player, a win gives 2 points to the winner, and the loser gets 0 points.
- If the scores are not possible with valid games, the program should return -1.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Total Points Calculation**:
   - The total points are calculated as \( p_1 + p_2 + p_3 \).
   - If the total points are odd, it's impossible to have a valid set of games (since each game contributes either 2 or 2 points in total), so the program correctly returns -1.

2. **Total Matches Calculation**:
   - The total number of matches is \( \text{total\_points} // 2 \).
   - If the total matches exceed 3 (since there are only 3 players, the maximum number of unique pairs is 3), or if the highest score \( p_3 \) is greater than the total matches, the scores are invalid, and the program correctly returns -1.

3. **Draw Calculation**:
   - The formula \( \text{egalites} = \text{total\_points} - 2 \times (p_3 - p_2) - 2 \times (p_3 - p_1) \) is used to calculate the number of draws.
   - This formula aims to account for the points that must have come from losses (since \( p_3 \) and \( p_2 \) are higher, the difference in their scores must come from wins).
   - If the calculated number of draws is negative, it indicates an inconsistency, and the program correctly returns -1.
   - Otherwise, the number of draws is divided by 2 (since each draw contributes 2 points) and added to the results.

### Testing the Program:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**: `(0, 0, 0)`
   - Total points: 0 (even), total matches: 0.
   - No games, hence no draws. Correct output: `0`.

2. **Example 2**: `(0, 1, 1)`
   - Total points: 2 (even), total matches: 1.
   - One draw is possible. Correct output: `1`.

3. **Example 3**: `(1, 1, 1)`
   - Total points: 3 (odd). Correct output: `-1`.

4. **Example 4**: `(1, 1, 2)`
   - Total points: 4 (even), total matches: 2.
   - Two draws are possible. Correct output: `2`.

5. **Example 5**: `(3, 3, 3)`
   - Total points: 9 (odd). Correct output: `-1`.

6. **Example 6**: `(3, 4, 5)`
   - Total points: 12 (even), total matches: 6.
   - Six draws are possible. Correct output: `6`.

7. **Example 7**: `(1, 1, 10)`
   - Total points: 12 (even), total matches: 6.
   - Two draws are possible. Correct output: `2`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle all the test cases and edge conditions described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
