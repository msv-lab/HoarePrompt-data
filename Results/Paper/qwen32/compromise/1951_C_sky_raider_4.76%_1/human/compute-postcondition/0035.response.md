Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 2`, `m` is set according to user input, `k` is `k - 2s`, `l` is set according to user input, `c` is updated to `c + 2 * (l[i] * s - s * s / 2)`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `s` is recalculated to be the minimum of `m` and `k`. All other variables retain their previously described states and values.
