Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's determine the new state after executing the code.

Initial State: 
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `m` remains unchanged
- `k` is `k - 2 * s`
- `c` is updated to `c + l[0] * s - s * s / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`
- `l` remains unchanged
- `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k - s`

Code Snippet:
```python
s = min(m, k)
```

After executing the code snippet, the value of `s` is reassigned to be the minimum of `m` and `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` remains unchanged, `k` is `k - 2 * s`, `c` is updated to `c + l[0] * s - s * s / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, `l` remains unchanged, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`**.
