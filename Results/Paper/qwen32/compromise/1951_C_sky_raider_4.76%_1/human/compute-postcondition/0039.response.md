To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(c))` statement, let's break down the initial state and how the variables are manipulated:

### Initial State:
- `i` is set to `n`.
- `k` is reduced by the sum of all `s` values across iterations.
- `c` is updated by adding `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration.
- `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` in the last iteration.

### Analysis:
- The variable `c` is updated iteratively based on the formula `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`.
- The variable `s` in each iteration is determined as the minimum of `m` and the current value of `k`.
- The variable `k` is reduced by the sum of all `s` values from previous iterations.
- The final value of `c` is what gets printed after all iterations are completed.

### Output Description:
Given the above steps, the value of `c` is computed through multiple iterations involving the list `l`, the variable `m`, and the initial value of `k`. Since the specific values of `l`, `m`, `k`, and `n` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `c`.

However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the final value of `c` as the result of the iterative updates described.

### Final Output:
Output: **c (where c is the final value computed through the iterative updates involving l, m, and k)**
