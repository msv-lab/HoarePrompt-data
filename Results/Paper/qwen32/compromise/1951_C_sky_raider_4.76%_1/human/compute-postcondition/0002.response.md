The code reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `l`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input.**
