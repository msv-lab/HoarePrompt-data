The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` remains unchanged, `k` is `k - s`, `c` is updated to `c + l[0] * s - s * s / 2`, `l` remains unchanged, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`**
