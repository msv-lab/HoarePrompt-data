To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(n):`, so the only variable we can adjust is `n`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. The values of `m`, `k`, `l`, `s`, and `c` do not directly affect whether the loop will execute, as they are not part of the loop head.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m`, `k`, `l`, `s`, and `c` can remain as given**.

However, since the task specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, we only need to specify the condition for `n`:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**.
