Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `m` remains unchanged
- `k` is `k - 2 * s`
- `c` is updated to `c + l[0] * s - s * s / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`
- `l` remains unchanged
- `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`

Code Snippet:
```python
k -= s
```

Impact:
- `k` is decremented by `s`.

Since `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, and `k` is being decremented by `s`, the new value of `k` will be `k - s`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` remains unchanged, `k` is `k - 2 * s - s`, `c` is updated to `c + l[0] * s - s * s / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, `l` remains unchanged, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k - 2 * s`**

Natural Language Explanation:
- `n` must still be greater than 2.
- `i` remains 2.
- `m` does not change.
- `k` is now `k - 2 * s - s`.
- `c` is updated as specified.
- `l` remains unchanged.
- `s` is recalculated as the minimum of `m` and the new value of `k`.
