The code snippet assigns the minimum value between `m` and `k` to the variable `s`. The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation. The condition `n` must be greater than `i + 1` remains valid, and `i` is still `i + 1`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `s` is `min(m, k)`**.
