The only objects in the loop head are the underscore `_` and the result of `int(input())`. Since the underscore `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the execution of the loop, the only variable that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is the result of `int(input())`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input provided to `int(input())` is a positive integer.

Given the conditions in the problem statement, the state of `arr`, `s`, `num`, `LA`, and `ppp` do not affect the execution of the loop and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`arr` is `[(1, 2, 2), (3, 4, 3)]`, `s` is `4`, `num` is `-1`, `LA` is `1`, `ppp` is `23` if `ppp` is `23`, otherwise unchanged, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
