You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are t test cases (1 \le t \le 10^4). For each test case, there is an integer n (2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5) representing the length of the array a. The array a consists of n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n where each a_i satisfies 1 \le a_i \le 10^6. There are q queries (1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5) for each test case, and each query is defined by two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n) representing the boundaries of the query. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: `arr` is `[(1, 2, 2), (3, 4, 3)]`, `s` is `4`, `num` is `-1`.
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    if (ppp == 23) :
        print(nums)
        #This is printed: NameError: name 'nums' is not defined
    #State: `arr` is `[(1, 2, 2), (3, 4, 3)]`, `s` is `4`, `num` is `-1`, `LA` is `1`. If `ppp` is `23`, then `ppp` remains `23`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if tc > 5:
            if ppp == 23:
                print(l, r)
            continue
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: arr is [(1, 2, 2), (3, 4, 3)], s is 4, num is -1, LA is 1, ppp is 23.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a`, and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, there are `q` queries, where each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` representing the boundaries of the query. The function returns the sum of the elements in the array `a` from index `l` to `r` for each query.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
