The code snippet provided only initializes the variable `e` to 0. The other variables (`input`, `N`, `nums`, and `s`) are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.readline`, `N` is assigned the value of the first integer read from the input, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input line, `s` is 0, and `e` is 0.**
