To determine the output state after the loop executes, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables `arr`, `s`, `num`, `LA`, and `ppp`. However, the provided loop code introduces several variables and logic that are not defined in the initial state (`tc`, `N`, `bisect_left`). For the sake of this problem, we will assume that the loop does not modify `arr`, `s`, `num`, `LA`, and `ppp` directly since there is no explicit assignment to these variables within the loop body. The loop seems to be focused on printing certain values based on the input values `l` and `r`, but it does not alter the state of the initial variables.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is `[(1, 2, 2), (3, 4, 3)]`
- `s` is `4`
- `num` is `-1`
- `LA` is `1`
- `ppp` is `23` (remains `23` as per the condition)

Since the loop does not modify `arr`, `s`, `num`, `LA`, and `ppp` directly, the output state will be the same as the initial state.

Output State: **arr is [(1, 2, 2), (3, 4, 3)], s is 4, num is -1, LA is 1, ppp is 23.**
