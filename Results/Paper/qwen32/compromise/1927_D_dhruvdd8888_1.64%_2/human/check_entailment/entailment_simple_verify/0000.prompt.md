You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are t test cases (1 \le t \le 10^4). For each test case, there is an integer n (2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5) representing the length of the array a. The array a consists of n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n where each a_i satisfies 1 \le a_i \le 10^6. There are q queries (1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5) for each test case, and each query is defined by two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n) representing the boundaries of the query. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided code does not correctly handle the problem as described. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Query Handling**:
   - The code has a conditional block `if tc > 5:` that skips processing most queries. This means that the code does not handle the queries as required for most test cases.
   - Specifically, the code only processes queries for the 24th test case (`if ppp == 23:`), and for other test cases, it just continues without processing the queries.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Different Elements**:
   - The logic for finding the indices `i` and `j` such that `a_i != a_j` within the range `[l, r]` is flawed.
   - The code uses `bisect_left` to find a segment in `arr` that starts at or before `l`, but it does not correctly check if there are two different elements within the range `[l, r]`.
   - The code does not handle the case where there are multiple segments within the range `[l, r]` and there might be different elements in different segments.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where the array segment `[l, r]` contains only one unique element.
   - The code does not correctly handle cases where the array segment `[l, r]` contains multiple unique elements.

### Example of Incorrectness:

Consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

The correct output should be:
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

However, the provided code will not produce the correct output because it skips processing most queries due to the `if tc > 5:` condition. For the 24th test case, it might work, but for other test cases, it will not process the queries correctly.

### Conclusion:

The code is incorrect because it does not handle queries correctly for most test cases and does not implement the logic to find two different elements within the specified range `[l, r]` properly.
