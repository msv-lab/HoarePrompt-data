Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by using prefix XOR values and binary search. However, it does not correctly determine whether a subarray can be split into multiple parts with equal XOR values. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Subarrays**: The program checks if there exists an index `it1` in the prefix XOR list `v1` (corresponding to `pf[r]`) and an index `it2` in the prefix XOR list `v2` (corresponding to `pf[l-1]`) such that `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`. This condition does not guarantee that the subarray can be split into multiple parts with equal XOR values.

2. **Handling of XOR Values**: The program only checks if the XOR of the entire subarray (`pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`) is zero or if there exists a valid split point. However, it does not ensure that the XOR values of all resulting segments are the same.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as dynamic programming or a segment tree, to efficiently handle the queries and determine if the subarray can be split into multiple parts with equal XOR values.
