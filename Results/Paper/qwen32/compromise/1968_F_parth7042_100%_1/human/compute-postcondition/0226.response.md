Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `q`, an array `a` of `n` integers, and `q` queries. Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r`. The function processes these inputs and returns the result of each query, which is not explicitly detailed in the provided output description. The function handles constraints on the values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `a_i`, `l`, and `r` as specified.**
