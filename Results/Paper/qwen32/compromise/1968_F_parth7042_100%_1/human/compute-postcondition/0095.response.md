The code snippet `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` modifies the defaultdict `mp` by appending the value of `i` to the list corresponding to the key `pf[i]`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.
- `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[index])`.
- `data` is unchanged.
- `index` is `n + 7`.
- `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries (either 'YES' or 'NO').
- `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ int(data[index])`.
- `mp` is a defaultdict with the key `0` mapping to the list `[0, i]` if `pf[i]` is `0`, or with an additional key `pf[i]` mapping to the list `[i]` if `pf[i]` is not `0`.
- `i` is `n`.

After executing `mp[pf[i]].append(i)`, the defaultdict `mp` will have the value of `i` appended to the list corresponding to the key `pf[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[index])`; `data` is unchanged; `index` is `n + 7`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries (either 'YES' or 'NO'); `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ int(data[index])`; `mp` is a defaultdict with the key `0` mapping to the list `[0, i]` if `pf[i]` is `0`, or with an additional key `pf[i]` mapping to the list `[i]` if `pf[i]` is not `0`, and now `mp[pf[i]]` includes `i` at the end of its list; `i` is `n`.**
