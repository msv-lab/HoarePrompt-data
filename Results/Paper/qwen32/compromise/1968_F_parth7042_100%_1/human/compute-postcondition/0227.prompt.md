You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and q are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5. The array a contains n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i < 2^30. Each query is defined by two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5 and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        q = int(data[index + 1])
        
        index += 2
        
        a = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        pf = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        mp = defaultdict(list)
        
        mp[0].append(0)
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            a[i] = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
            mp[pf[i]].append(i)
        
        for _ in range(q):
            l = int(data[index])
            r = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
            if x == 0:
                results.append('YES')
                continue
            v1 = mp[pf[r]]
            v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
            it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
            it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
            if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
                results.append('YES')
            else:
                results.append('NO')
        
    #State: `t` is `0`; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]` from the last iteration; `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` from the last iteration; `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[0]` is `0` and `a[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n` are the integers read from `data` starting at `index + 2`; `data` is unchanged; `index` is the final index after processing all `n` and `q` values; `results` is a list containing the results of all queries from all iterations; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[0]` is `0` and `pf[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n` are the cumulative XOR values of `a` up to that index; `mp` is a defaultdict where each key is a unique XOR value in `pf` and maps to a list of indices where that XOR value was achieved.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: The contents of the `results` list, each element separated by a newline character
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `q`, an array `a` of `n` integers, and `q` queries. Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r`. The function processes these inputs and returns the result of each query, which is not explicitly detailed in the provided output description. The function handles constraints on the values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `a_i`, `l`, and `r` as specified.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
