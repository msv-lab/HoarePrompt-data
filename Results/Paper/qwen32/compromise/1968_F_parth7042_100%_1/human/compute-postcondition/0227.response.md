Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n`, an integer `q`, an array `a` of `n` integers, and `q` queries. Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r`. The function determines for each query whether there exists a subarray within the range `[l, r]` such that the XOR of all its elements is zero. The results of these queries are printed, one per line.**
