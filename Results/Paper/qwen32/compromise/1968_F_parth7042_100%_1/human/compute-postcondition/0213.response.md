The code snippet simply appends the string `'YES'` to the `results` list. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `index`, `x`) are modified by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2; `n` is the integer value of `data[2n + 2(q-1) + 3]`; `q` is greater than 0; `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is the initial `index` value plus 2; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `results` has `'YES'` appended to it.**
