Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2; `n` is the integer value of `data[2n + 2q + 5]`; `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` are the integers read from `data` starting at `index`; `data` is unchanged; `index` is `2n + 2q + 5 + n + 1`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries (either 'YES' or 'NO'); `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[0]` is 0 and `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` are the cumulative XOR values of `a` up to that index; `mp` is a defaultdict where each key is a unique XOR value in `pf` and maps to a list of indices where that XOR value was achieved.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[index])
    r = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp[pf[r]]
    v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
    it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2; `n` is the integer value of `data[2n + 2q + 5]`; `q` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` are the integers read from `data` starting at `index`; `data` is unchanged; `index` is `2n + 2q + 5 + n + 3`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries (either 'YES' or 'NO') with an additional 'YES' appended if `x` is 0; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[0]` is 0 and `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` are the cumulative XOR values of `a` up to that index; `mp` is a defaultdict where each key is a unique XOR value in `pf` and maps to a list of indices where that XOR value was achieved; `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. If `x` is 0, then 'YES' is appended to `results`. `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it1` is the index in `v1` where the first element not less than `l` is found; `it2` is the index in `v2` where the first element not greater than `r` is found minus 1`. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, and the element at `v1[it1]` is less than the element at `v2[it2]`, then 'YES' is appended to `results`. Otherwise, 'NO' is appended to `results`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2; `n` is the integer value of `data[2n + 2q + 3]`; `q` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1; `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` are the integers read from `data` starting at `index`; `data` is unchanged; `index` is `2n + 2q + 10 + n`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries (either 'YES' or 'NO') with an additional 'YES' appended if `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] < v2[it2])`, otherwise 'NO' is appended; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[0]` is 0 and `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` are the cumulative XOR values of `a` up to that index; `mp` is a defaultdict where each key is a unique XOR value in `pf` and maps to a list of indices where that XOR value was achieved; `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it1` is the index in `v1` where the first element not less than `l` is found; `it2` is the index in `v2` where the first element not greater than `r` is found minus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2; `n` is the integer value of `data[2n + 2(q-1) + 3]`; `q` is greater than 0; `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is the initial `index` value plus 2; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; if `x` is 0, `'YES'` is appended to `results`; `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]; it1` is the insertion point of `l` in `v1`; `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. If `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, then `'YES'` is appended to `results`. Otherwise, `'NO'` is appended to `results`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
