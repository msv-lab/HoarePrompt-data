Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` are the integer values of `data[3]` to `data[n + 2]`; `data` is unchanged; `index` is `n + 3 + 2 * q`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries (either 'YES' or 'NO'); `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[0]` is 0 and `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` are the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`; `mp` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and `mp[0]` is `[0]`, and for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list of indices `i` where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR up to that point.** The loop has finished executing all `q` iterations, and `q` is now 0, indicating no more queries to process.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- `t`, `n`, `a`, `data`, `pf`, and `mp` remain unchanged as per their initial setup.
- `q` is decremented to 0, indicating that all queries have been processed.
- `index` is adjusted to reflect the number of processed queries.
- `results` contains the answers ('YES' or 'NO') for all the queries that were processed in the loop.
