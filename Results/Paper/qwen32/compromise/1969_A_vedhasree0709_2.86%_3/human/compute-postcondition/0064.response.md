Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers from the input, the current value of `l[i]` (which is `l[0]`) is 2, and the current value of `l[i + 1]` (which is `l[1]`) is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been updated to 1, while all other variables retain their initial values.
