The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `l`. The variables `t` and `n` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
