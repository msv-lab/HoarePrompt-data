To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which is `i` and `n` in this case.

The loop condition is `i <= n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000
- `n` is the new input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5000
- `l` is the list of integers obtained from the input
- `i` is 1

Let's analyze the condition `i <= n - 1`:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `1` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`.

This means that `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, we need to ensure `n` is adjusted to be at least 2.

No other states need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop condition.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000; `n` must be at least 2; `l` is the list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 1**
