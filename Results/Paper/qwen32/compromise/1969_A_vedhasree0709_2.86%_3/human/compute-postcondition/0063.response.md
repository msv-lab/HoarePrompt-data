The code provided contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `2`. This value is explicitly given in the `print` statement and does not depend on any variables or objects defined in the initial state.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
- The initial state provides values for variables `i`, `j`, `n`, and a list `l`, but these do not affect the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement directly outputs the number `2`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
