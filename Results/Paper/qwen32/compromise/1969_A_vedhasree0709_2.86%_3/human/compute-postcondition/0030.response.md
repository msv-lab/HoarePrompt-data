The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and then assigns this list of integers to the variable `l`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is the list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is either the previous `n` or the value at which the condition was met; `j` is 0.**
