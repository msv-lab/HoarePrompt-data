The given Python code snippet includes a `print` statement that outputs the integer `2`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, and `i`), but none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value to be printed is explicitly provided in the code itself.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, and `i`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement directly outputs the integer `2`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
