Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers such that each integer `p_i` satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i != i. For each test case, the function returns the number of fixed points in the permutation `p`, where a fixed point is defined as an index `i` such that p_i = i.**
