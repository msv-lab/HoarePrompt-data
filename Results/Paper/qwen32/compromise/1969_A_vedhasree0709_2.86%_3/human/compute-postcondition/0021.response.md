Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000; `n` is greater than or equal to 3; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 2; `j` is 1; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, and `j` do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
