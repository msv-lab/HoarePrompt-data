Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and the current value of `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `w[j]` has been incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`.**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes executing all `n` iterations, the variable `q` will have its elements incremented based on the values in the list `w`. Specifically, for each index `j` from `0` to `n-1`, the element at index `w[j]` in `q` will have been incremented by 1. The variables `t`, `n`, and `buffer` remain unchanged from their initial states.
