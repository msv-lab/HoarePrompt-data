Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n` and the value at key `w[j]` incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `eta` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n` that have a non-zero count in `q`, `eta_ln` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `rho` is the original value of `rho` plus `q[eta[2]]` plus `q[eta[j]]`, `res` is updated to `res + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`. If `j` is greater than 1000, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no additional changes occur.**

In natural language, the value of `rho` is updated by adding the value of `q[eta[j]]` to it. All other variables remain unchanged.
