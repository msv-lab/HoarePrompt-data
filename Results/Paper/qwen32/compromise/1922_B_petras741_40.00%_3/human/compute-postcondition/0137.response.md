The code snippet provided is:
```python
eta_ln = len(eta)
```
This line of code calculates the length of the list `eta` and assigns that length to the variable `eta_ln`. 

Given the initial state, `eta` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n` that have a non-zero count in the dictionary `q`. The length of `eta`, `eta_ln`, is calculated and updated.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n` and the value at key `w[j]` incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `eta` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n` that have a non-zero count in `q`, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`, `rho` and `res` are defined based on the conditions given, `j` is `n`.**
