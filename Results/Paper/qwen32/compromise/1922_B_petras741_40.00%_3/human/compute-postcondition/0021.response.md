The code snippet `eta.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `eta`. Given the initial state, `eta` initially contains the single element `0` if `q[j]` is greater than 0, or it is an empty list otherwise. Since `j` is 1, the value `1` will be appended to `eta`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and the current value of `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `w[j]` has been incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `j` is 1, `eta` is a list containing the elements `[0, 1]` if `q[j]` was greater than 0, or `[1]` if `eta` was initially an empty list.**
