Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n` and the value at key `w[j]` incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `eta` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n` that have a non-zero count in `q`, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`, `rho` is the count of the smallest integer in `w` that appears at least once if `eta_ln` is 1, otherwise `rho` is the cumulative sum of `q[eta[j]]` for all `j` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1`. `res` is defined based on the conditions given: if `eta_ln` is 1, `res` remains as defined; otherwise, `res` includes contributions from `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` and `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for all `j` from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`. If `n` is less than 3, `i` is incremented by 2. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is equal to `eta_ln` if `eta_ln` is greater than 1, otherwise `j` remains `n`.**
