To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to evaluate the expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6` based on the initial state provided.

The initial state tells us that:
- `n` is an integer and its current value is greater than or equal to 3.
- `buffer` is an empty list (though not used in the print statement).
- `w` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive.
- `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `w[j]` has been incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`.
- `j` is `n`.
- `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` (from 0 to n) for which `q[j]` is greater than 0.
- `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta` and its current value is 1.
- `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`.

However, the print statement only involves the variable `n`. The expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6` calculates the number of combinations of `n` items taken 3 at a time, often denoted as C(n, 3) or "n choose 3".

Given that `n` is at least 3, let's consider the smallest possible value for `n` which is 3. The expression evaluates to:
\[ 3 * (3 - 1) * (3 - 2) // 6 = 3 * 2 * 1 // 6 = 6 // 6 = 1 \]

If `n` were 4, the expression would evaluate to:
\[ 4 * (4 - 1) * (4 - 2) // 6 = 4 * 3 * 2 // 6 = 24 // 6 = 4 \]

If `n` were 5, the expression would evaluate to:
\[ 5 * (5 - 1) * (5 - 2) // 6 = 5 * 4 * 3 // 6 = 60 // 6 = 10 \]

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified beyond it being greater than or equal to 3, the output will depend on the specific value of `n`. However, the expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6` is well-defined for any integer `n` greater than or equal to 3.

Output: **n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6 (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 3)**
