The code snippet provided reads an integer value from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This variable `t` represents the number of test cases. The initial state indicates that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4. After executing the code, the value of `t` is set to the integer input, and all other conditions and variables from the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input value, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 3 * 10^5, and a list of `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 0 <= a_i <= `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
