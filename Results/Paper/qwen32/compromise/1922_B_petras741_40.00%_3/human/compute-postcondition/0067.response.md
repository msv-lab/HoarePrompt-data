The only object in the loop head is the variable `j`. Therefore, we need to adjust only `j` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `buffer` is an empty list
- `w` is a new list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive
- `q` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n` and the value at key `w[0]` is incremented by 1
- `eta` is an empty list
- `eta_ln` is 0
- `rho` is not defined
- `j` is 0

Since `j` is the loop variable and it is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a new list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n` and the value at key `w[0]` is incremented by 1, `eta` is an empty list, `eta_ln` is 0, `rho` is not defined, `j` is 1**
