The code snippet `eta.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `eta`. The value of `j` is incremented by 1 before this operation, so `eta` will now include the incremented value of `j`. All other variables remain unchanged except for `eta`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a new list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n` and the value at each key `w[j]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `j` in the range of `n`, `eta` is a list containing the element `j` (after it has been incremented by 1) if `q[j]` is greater than 0, otherwise `eta` is an empty list, `eta_ln` is 0, `rho` is not defined, `j` is incremented by 1**.
