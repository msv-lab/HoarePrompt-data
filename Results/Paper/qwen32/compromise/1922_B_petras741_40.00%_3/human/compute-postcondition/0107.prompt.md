Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a new list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n` and the value at each key `w[j]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `j` in the range of `n`, `eta` is a list containing all keys from `q` for which `q[j] > 0`, `eta_ln` is the number of keys in `q` that have a value greater than 0, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`, `eta_ln` is not equal to 1, `res` is `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, eta_ln):
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
    rho += q[eta[j]]
    if j > 1000:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a new list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n` and the value at each key `w[j]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `j` in the range of `n`, `eta` is a list containing all keys from `q` for which `q[j] > 0`, `eta_ln` is the number of keys in `q` that have a value greater than 0, `rho` is `q[eta[0]] + q[eta[j]]`, and `res` is updated to `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`. If `j` is greater than 1000, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a new list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n` and the value at each key `w[j]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `j` in the range of `n`, `eta` is a list containing all keys from `q` for which `q[j] > 0`, `eta_ln` is the number of keys in `q` that have a value greater than 0, `rho` is `q[eta[0]] + 2 * q[eta[j]]`, `res` is updated to `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho + 2 * q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, and `j` is incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than 1000, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues as described.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a new list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n` and the value at each key `w[j]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `j` in the range of `n`, `eta` is a list containing all keys from `q` for which `q[j] > 0`, `eta_ln` is the number of keys in `q` that have a value greater than 0, `rho` is `q[eta[0]] + 2 * q[eta[1]] + q[eta[2]]`, `res` is updated to its previous value plus `q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) * (q[eta[2]] - 2) // 6` plus `q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, and `j` is 2. If `j` is greater than 1000, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues as described without any additional changes.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
