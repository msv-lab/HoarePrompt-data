Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n` and the value at key `w[j]` incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `eta` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n` that have a non-zero count in `q`, `eta_ln` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `rho` is a complex expression involving `rho` and values from `q` and `eta`, `res` is updated to `res + q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) * (q[eta[2]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) // 2 * rho`**

The value of `res` has been updated by adding the result of `q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) // 2 * rho` to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
