The given code snippet is:

```python
buffer = []
```

This line of code initializes an empty list named `buffer`. The initial state includes `t`, `n`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. None of these variables are affected by the given code snippet. The only change is the creation of the `buffer` list.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input value, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 3 * 10^5, and a list of `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 0 <= a_i <= `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; `buffer` is an empty list.**
