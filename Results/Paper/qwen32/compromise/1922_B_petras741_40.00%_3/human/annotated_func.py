#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 0 <= a_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer, `w` is the last list of `n` integers, `buffer` is an empty list, and all test cases have been processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of ways to choose three distinct indices such that the elements at those indices are the same, considering specific constraints. If `n` is less than 3, it prints 0. The function handles up to 10,000 test cases with a total list length not exceeding 300,000 integers.
