Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, so `i` is now `i + 1`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `output1` contains the integer `i` and `output2` contains the integer `x / i`. Otherwise, `output1` and `output2` remain empty lists. `output1` now contains the integer `i`; `output2` now contains the integer `x / i`.**

Natural Language: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The integer `x / i` has been appended to `output2`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `output1` contains the integer `i` and `output2` contains the integer `x / i`. The values of `x` and `n` remain unchanged, and they still satisfy the condition 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9.
