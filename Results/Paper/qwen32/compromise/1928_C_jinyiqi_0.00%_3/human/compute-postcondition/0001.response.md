The provided code snippet initializes `output2` as an empty list. This operation does not affect the values of `x`, `n`, or `output1`. Therefore, the values of `x` and `n` remain integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `output1` remains an empty list. The only change is the introduction of `output2` as an empty list.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `output1` is an empty list; `output2` is an empty list.**
