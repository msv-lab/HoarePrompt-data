Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 â‰¤ x < n â‰¤ 10^9; `output1` is a list containing the integer `i`; `output2` is an empty list; `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`).**

Explanation: The integer `i` has been appended to `output1`, making it a list containing `i`. The values of `x`, `n`, and the condition that `x` is divisible by `i` remain unchanged. `output2` remains an empty list.
