To determine the final output state after the loop completes all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. During each iteration, if `x` is divisible by `i`, it appends `i` to `output1` and `x // i` to `output2`.

The loop stops when `i` exceeds `int(x ** 0.5)`. At the end of the loop, `output1` will contain all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `output2` will contain the corresponding complementary divisors (i.e., `x // i`).

Given that `n` is not modified within the loop and is only mentioned in the initial state, it remains unchanged.

Let's summarize the final state:

- `x` and `n` remain as they were initially.
- `output1` will contain all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`.
- `output2` will contain the corresponding complementary divisors of `x`.

**Output State: `x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `output1` is a list containing all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`; `output2` is a list containing the corresponding complementary divisors of `x` (i.e., `x // i` for each `i` in `output1`).**
