The code snippet provided appends the value of `i` to the list `output1`. The values of `x`, `n`, and the condition regarding divisibility remain unchanged. The only change is that `output1` now contains the integer `i`.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; if `x` is divisible by `i`, then `output1` is a list containing the integer `i` and `output2` is a list containing the integer `x / i`. Otherwise, `output1` and `output2` remain empty lists. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `output1` now contains the integer `i`.**
