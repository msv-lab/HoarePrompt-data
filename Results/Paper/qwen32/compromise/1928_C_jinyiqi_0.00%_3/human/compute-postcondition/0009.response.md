The code appends the integer value of `x / i` to the list `output2`. Since `i` is incremented before this line of code is executed, we need to consider the value of `i` after it has been incremented. The values of `x` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the provided code snippet. The lists `output1` and `output2` are affected by the code, but only `output2` is explicitly modified here.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; if `x` is divisible by `i`, then `output1` is a list containing the integer `i` and `output2` is a list containing the integer `x / i`. Otherwise, `output1` and `output2` remain empty lists. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `output1` now contains the integer `i`; `output2` now contains the integer `x / i`.**

In simpler terms, the integer value of `x` divided by the incremented `i` is added to the `output2` list. The values of `x` and `n` stay the same. The `output1` list contains the incremented `i`.
