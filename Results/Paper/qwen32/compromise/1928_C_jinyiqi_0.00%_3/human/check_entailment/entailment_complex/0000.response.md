### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine how many natural numbers `k` fit under the given constraints such that, given Vasya's position `n` in the line and the number `x` he received during the settling, the conditions of the problem are satisfied.

The settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions. For a given `k`, the numbers assigned to the students follow a specific pattern:
- The first `k` students receive numbers `1, 2, ..., k`.
- The next `k-2` students receive numbers `k-1, k-2, ..., 2`.
- This pattern repeats.

Given Vasya's position `n` and the number `x` he received, we need to check if there exist values of `k` such that Vasya's position `n` corresponds to the number `x` in the described pattern.

The program checks two conditions:
1. `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`
2. `(n - x) % 2 == 0`

For each condition, it calculates the divisors of the resulting value and checks if `(s + 2) / 2` is a valid `k` that satisfies `k >= x`.

The function `func_1(x)` calculates all divisors of `x` and returns them in a specific order.

Let's break down the logic of the program:
- For each test case, the program reads `n` and `x`.
- It checks the two conditions and calculates the divisors of the resulting values.
- It then checks if `(s + 2) / 2` is a valid `k` and adds it to the output list if it is.
- Finally, it removes duplicates from the output list and prints the number of unique `k` values.

The correctness of the program depends on whether the logic correctly identifies all valid `k` values that satisfy the conditions of the problem. The provided program seems to follow the logic correctly based on the problem description and the examples given.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly determine the number of valid `k` values for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
