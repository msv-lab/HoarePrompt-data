Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description. Let's analyze the code and identify the problems.

### Issues in the Provided Code:

1. **Undefined Function `func_1`:** The function `func_1` is called but not defined anywhere in the provided code. This will result in a `NameError` when the program is executed.

2. **Logic Errors:**
    - The program attempts to calculate the divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x` and checks if `(s + 2) / 2` is a valid `k` value. However, the logic to determine `k` from these divisors is incorrect.
    - The program does not correctly handle the condition for `k` values. Specifically, it should check if the calculated `k` fits the pattern described in the problem statement.

3. **Output Handling:**
    - The program calculates potential `k` values but does not print them. It seems like the intention was to print the count of valid `k` values, but the code does not do that.

4. **Edge Cases:**
    - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `n` and `x` are very large or when `x` is close to `n`.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to determine the values of `k` that fit the pattern described. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def count_valid_k(n, x):
    count = 0
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        period = 2 * k - 2
        position_in_period = (n - 1) % period
        if position_in_period < k and position_in_period + 1 == x:
            count += 1
        elif position_in_period >= k and 2 * k - 2 - position_in_period == x:
            count += 1
    return count

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_k(n, x))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:

1. **Loop through Possible `k` Values:**
    - The loop iterates over all possible `k` values from 2 to `n`.

2. **Calculate the Period:**
    - For each `k`, the period is `2 * k - 2`.

3. **Determine Position in the Period:**
    - The position in the period is calculated as `(n - 1) % period`.

4. **Check if the Position Matches the Given `x`:**
    - If the position in the period is less than `k` and matches `x - 1`, or if it is greater than or equal to `k` and matches `2 * k - 2 - position_in_period`, then `k` is valid.

5. **Count Valid `k` Values:**
    - The count of valid `k` values is returned and printed for each test case.

This corrected program ensures that all possible `k` values are checked and correctly handles the conditions described in the problem statement.
