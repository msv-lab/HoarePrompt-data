Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `numInteger` is the integer value provided by the user input, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings representing the numbers provided by the user input in ascending order with the first two elements removed, `suma` is `min(a, b)`, `a` is the integer value of the first element that was initially removed from `numbers`, `b` is the integer value of the second element that was removed from `numbers`.**

In simple terms, the value of `suma` is now the smaller of the two integers `a` and `b`. All other variables retain their previous values.
