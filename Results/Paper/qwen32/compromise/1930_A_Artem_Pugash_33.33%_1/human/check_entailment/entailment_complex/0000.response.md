### Reasoning:

The given problem requires us to find the maximum final score achievable by repeatedly selecting pairs of integers from a list and adding the smaller integer of each pair to the score. The optimal strategy to maximize the score is to always pair the smallest available integers together. This ensures that we are consistently adding the smallest possible values to the score, which is the best we can do given the constraints.

Let's break down the provided program to see if it implements this strategy correctly:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers (`n`) and the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The list of integers is sorted in non-decreasing order. This step ensures that the smallest integers are at the beginning of the list, allowing us to easily pick the smallest pairs.

3. **Pairing and Summing:**
   - The program iteratively removes the first two elements from the sorted list (which are the smallest due to sorting), adds the smaller of the two to the score, and continues until the list is empty.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all pairs for a test case, the program outputs the computed score.

This approach is consistent with the optimal strategy of pairing the smallest integers together to maximize the score. Therefore, the program should produce the correct output for any valid input within the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
