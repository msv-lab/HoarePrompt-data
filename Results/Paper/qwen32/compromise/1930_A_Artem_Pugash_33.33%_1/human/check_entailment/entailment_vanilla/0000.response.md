### Reasoning:

To solve the problem, we need to maximize the score by selecting pairs of integers and adding the minimum of each pair to the score. The optimal strategy involves sorting the numbers in ascending order and then pairing them sequentially. This way, we ensure that the smaller numbers are paired together, thereby maximizing the contribution to the score from the smaller values.

Let's break down the given program to see if it correctly implements this strategy:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `numCases`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `numInteger` and the list of `2 * numInteger` integers.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The list of integers is sorted in ascending order using `numbers.sort(reverse=False)`. This is correct because we want to pair the smallest numbers together.

3. **Pairing and Summing:**
   - The program initializes `suma` to 0.
   - It then enters a loop where it repeatedly pops the first two elements from the sorted list, calculates their minimum, and adds this value to `suma`.
   - This process continues until the list is empty.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all pairs for a test case, the program prints the total score `suma`.

The logic implemented in the program correctly follows the optimal strategy of pairing the smallest numbers together to maximize the score. Therefore, the program should produce the correct output for the given problem.
