### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its function summary against the problem description to verify its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We have `2n` positive integers on a whiteboard.
- We need to perform `n` moves where each move involves choosing two integers, adding the smaller of the two to our score, and erasing both integers.
- The goal is to maximize the final score.

#### Optimal Strategy:
- To maximize the score, we should pair the smallest integers together. Sorting the list in ascending order and then pairing the first two, next two, and so on, ensures that we are always adding the smallest available integers to our score.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`numCases`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs (`numInteger`) and the list of `2 * numInteger` integers.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The list of integers is sorted in ascending order using `numbers.sort(reverse=False)`. This is correct as it aligns with the optimal strategy of pairing the smallest numbers.

3. **Pairing and Summing:**
   - The program initializes `suma` to 0.
   - It then enters a loop where it repeatedly pops the first two elements from the sorted list, calculates their minimum, and adds this value to `suma`.
   - This process continues until the list is empty.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all pairs for a test case, the program prints the total score `suma`.

#### Function Summary:
- The function summary accurately describes the program's behavior: it reads multiple test cases, sorts the numbers, pairs them sequentially, and sums the minimum values of each pair.

#### Verification:
- The program correctly implements the optimal strategy by sorting the numbers and pairing them sequentially.
- The function summary supports this reasoning.
- The original assessment correctly identifies that the program follows the optimal strategy and should produce the correct output.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as it adheres to the optimal strategy described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
