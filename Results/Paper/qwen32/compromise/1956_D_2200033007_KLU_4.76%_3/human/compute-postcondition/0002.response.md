Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `c` is a list of integers with a length `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 18\).
- Each element in `c` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\).
- `m` is initialized to 0.
- The current value of `c` is specified as 2, but this seems to be a misstatement because `c` is defined as a list, not a single integer. We will assume this is a mistake and focus on the list `c` as described.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'4 1')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement contains a formatted string `f'4 1'`.
- The string `f'4 1'` is a literal string and does not depend on any variables or the current state of the program.
- The variables `c` and `m` are not used in this `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `4 1` as it is.

### Final Output:
Output: **4 1**
