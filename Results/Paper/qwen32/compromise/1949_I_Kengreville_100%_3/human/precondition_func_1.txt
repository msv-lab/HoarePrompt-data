i is an integer representing an index in the range 0 to n-1, where n is the number of disks. x, y, r, visited, coef, and bipartite are lists or arrays where x[i] and y[i] are the integer coordinates of the center of the i-th disk, r[i] is the positive integer radius of the i-th disk, visited[i] is a boolean indicating whether the i-th disk has been visited, coef[i] is a coefficient used in the DFS to determine the bipartite nature of the graph formed by the disks, and bipartite is a boolean indicating whether the graph is bipartite.
