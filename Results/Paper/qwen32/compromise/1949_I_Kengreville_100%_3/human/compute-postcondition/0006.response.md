The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The state of `x`, `y`, `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, `bipartite`, and `r` are not relevant to the execution of the loop itself and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start. However, `i` must be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
