To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem and the provided solution.

**Problem Analysis:**

The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after the array is rearranged. To maximize this beauty, we want to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences. This can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the difference between the last (largest) and the first (smallest) elements. However, this is an oversimplification because the beauty is the sum of all consecutive differences, not just the difference between the maximum and minimum elements.

**Correct Approach:**

To maximize the beauty, we should arrange the array such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. The optimal arrangement is to alternate between the largest and smallest remaining elements. However, a simpler but equivalent approach is to sort the array and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

**Given Program Analysis:**

The given program sorts the array and then outputs the difference between the last and the first elements. This approach is incorrect because it only considers the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, not the sum of all consecutive differences.

**Correctness of the Program:**

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. It only outputs the difference between the largest and smallest elements, which is not the sum of all consecutive differences.

**Conclusion:**

Correctness: **False**
