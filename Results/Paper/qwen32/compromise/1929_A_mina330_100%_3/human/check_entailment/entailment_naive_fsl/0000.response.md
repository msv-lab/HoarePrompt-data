Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The current implementation simply prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted array, which does not necessarily maximize the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

To maximize the beauty of the array, we need to maximize the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. One way to achieve this is to arrange the elements in an alternating pattern of the largest and smallest remaining elements. This will ensure that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue with the current implementation:

Input:
```
1
4
1 3 2 4
```

Expected Output:
```
4
```
Explanation for the expected output:
One optimal arrangement of the array is `[1, 4, 2, 3]` or `[4, 1, 3, 2]`, both of which give a beauty of `(4 - 1) + (2 - 4) + (3 - 2) = 3 + (-2) + 1 = 2` or `(1 - 4) + (3 - 1) + (2 - 3) = -3 + 2 + (-1) = -2` respectively. However, another arrangement `[1, 4, 2, 3]` or `[4, 1, 3, 2]` can be `[1, 4, 2, 3]` or `[4, 1, 3, 2]` which gives `(4 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 3 + 1 = 4` or `(1 - 4) + (3 - 1) = -3 + 2 = -1` respectively.

The current implementation will output `4 - 1 = 3` or `4 - 1 = 3` which is incorrect.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
