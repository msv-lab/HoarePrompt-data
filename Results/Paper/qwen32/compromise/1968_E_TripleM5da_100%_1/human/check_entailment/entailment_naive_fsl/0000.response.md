Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of \(n\). The program always places the first two points at (1, 1) and (1, 2), and then places each subsequent point at (i, i) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n\). This placement does not guarantee that the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances will be achieved for all \(n\).

Let's consider an example to demonstrate this:

For \(n = 3\), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
3 3
```
The Manhattan distances between these points are:
- Between (1, 1) and (1, 2): \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
- Between (1, 1) and (3, 3): \(|1-3| + |1-3| = 4\)
- Between (1, 2) and (3, 3): \(|1-3| + |2-3| = 3\)

So, the set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{1, 3, 4\}\), which has a size of 3. However, the optimal arrangement for \(n = 3\) should be:
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```
The Manhattan distances between these points are:
- Between (2, 1) and (2, 3): \(|2-2| + |1-3| = 2\)
- Between (2, 1) and (3, 1): \(|2-3| + |1-1| = 1\)
- Between (2, 3) and (3, 1): \(|2-3| + |3-1| = 3\)

So, the set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{1, 2, 3\}\), which also has a size of 3. However, the example provided in the problem description for \(n = 3\) shows a different optimal arrangement:
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```
And the Manhattan distances are:
- Between (2, 1) and (2, 3): \(|2-2| + |1-3| = 2\)
- Between (2, 1) and (3, 1): \(|2-3| + |1-1| = 1\)
- Between (2, 3) and (3, 1): \(|2-3| + |3-1| = 3\)

So, the set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 4. This shows that the program does not always produce the optimal arrangement of points to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

Thus, the program is incorrect.
