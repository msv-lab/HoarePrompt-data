### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program and compare it to the problem requirements for maximizing the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\).

The program's approach for each test case is as follows:
1. It starts by printing the points (1, 1) and (1, 2).
2. Then, for each integer \(i\) from 3 to \(n\), it prints the point (i, i).

Let's evaluate this strategy for a few values of \(n\):

#### For \(n = 2\):
- Points: (1, 1), (1, 2)
- Distances: \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
- Distinct distances: \(\{1\}\)
- Size of \(\mathcal{H}\): 1
- This matches the problem statement, which indicates that the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 2\) is 2. The program does not achieve this.

#### For \(n = 3\):
- Points: (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3)
- Distances:
  - Between (1, 1) and (1, 2): 1
  - Between (1, 1) and (3, 3): 4
  - Between (1, 2) and (3, 3): 3
- Distinct distances: \(\{1, 3, 4\}\)
- Size of \(\mathcal{H}\): 3
- The problem statement indicates that the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 3\) is 4. The program does not achieve this.

#### For \(n = 4\):
- Points: (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4)
- Distances:
  - Between (1, 1) and (1, 2): 1
  - Between (1, 1) and (3, 3): 4
  - Between (1, 1) and (4, 4): 6
  - Between (1, 2) and (3, 3): 3
  - Between (1, 2) and (4, 4): 5
  - Between (3, 3) and (4, 4): 2
- Distinct distances: \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\)
- Size of \(\mathcal{H}\): 6
- The problem statement indicates that the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 4\) is 6. The program achieves this, but it's not clear if it is optimal for all \(n\).

#### For \(n = 5\):
- Points: (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5)
- Distances:
  - Between (1, 1) and (1, 2): 1
  - Between (1, 1) and (3, 3): 4
  - Between (1, 1) and (4, 4): 6
  - Between (1, 1) and (5, 5): 8
  - Between (1, 2) and (3, 3): 3
  - Between (1, 2) and (4, 4): 5
  - Between (1, 2) and (5, 5): 7
  - Between (3, 3) and (4, 4): 2
  - Between (3, 3) and (5, 5): 4
  - Between (4, 4) and (5, 5): 2
- Distinct distances: \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}\)
- Size of \(\mathcal{H}\): 8
- The problem statement indicates that the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 5\) is 8. The program achieves this, but it's not clear if it is optimal for all \(n\).

From the analysis, we can see that the program does not consistently maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\). It achieves the maximum for \(n = 4\) and \(n = 5\) but fails for \(n = 2\) and \(n = 3\). Additionally, the problem statement provides optimal arrangements for larger values of \(n\) that the program does not follow.

### Final: **False**
