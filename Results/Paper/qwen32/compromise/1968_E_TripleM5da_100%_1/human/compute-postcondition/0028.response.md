The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop starts with `i` initialized to 3 and continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, which means that the loop has not started yet. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be set to 3 (the starting value of the range) and `n` must be at least 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` must be at least 3, `i` is 3**
