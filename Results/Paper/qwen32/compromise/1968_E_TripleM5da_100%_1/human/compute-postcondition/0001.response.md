The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an input value and converts it to an integer, which is then assigned to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3. However, the code provided only updates the value of `n` for the current test case, and does not affect `t` or the conditions related to `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and `n` is the integer value read from the input, where 2 <= `n` <= 10^3.**
