The code snippet provided contains a `print` statement that outputs the value of the variable `i` twice. According to the initial state, `i` is an integer such that 4 <= i <= n + 1. However, the exact value of `i` is not specified, only its range.

Given this information, we can describe the output as follows:
The `print` statement will output the value of `i` twice, where `i` is an integer within the range 4 to `n + 1` (inclusive).

Output: **i, i (where i is an integer such that 4 <= i <= n + 1)**
