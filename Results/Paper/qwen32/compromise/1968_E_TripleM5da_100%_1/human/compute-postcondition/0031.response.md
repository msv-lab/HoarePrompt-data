Given the initial state, we have the following information:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `n` must be at least 4.
- `i` is explicitly set to 4.

The Python code snippet is:
```python
print(i, i)
```

The `print` statement will output the value of `i` twice. Since `i` is explicitly defined as 4, the output will be the number 4 printed twice.

Output: **4 4**
