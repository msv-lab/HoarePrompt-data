The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` must be at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 4. Additionally, `n` must still be at least 3, but since `i` is now 4, `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` must be at least 4, `i` is 4**
