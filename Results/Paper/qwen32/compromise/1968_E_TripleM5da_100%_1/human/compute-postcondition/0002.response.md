The `print(1, 1)` statement will output the values 1 and 1, separated by a space. This is because the print function in Python outputs the values of the arguments passed to it, separated by spaces by default. In this case, the arguments are the integer values 1 and 1.

The variables `t` and `n` mentioned in the initial state are not used in the print statement, so they do not affect the output.

Output: **1 1**
