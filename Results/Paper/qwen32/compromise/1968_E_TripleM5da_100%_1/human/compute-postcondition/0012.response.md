The code snippet `n = int(input())` will change the value of `n` to the integer value provided by the user input. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, and `i` is 0. The value of `n` is initially between 2 and 10^3, but it will be overwritten by the user input. The output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `i` is 0.**
