To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if the range function `range(3, n + 1)` generates at least one value. This means `n` must be at least 3, because `range(3, 3)` is an empty range and the loop will not execute.

The variable `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts, but the loop head sets `i` to start from 3. Therefore, the initial value of `i` before the loop does not affect the execution of the loop, as `i` will be set to 3 at the start of the first iteration.

Given this, the state needs to be adjusted so that `n` is at least 3. The value of `t` is not relevant to the execution of this loop, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` must be at least 3, `i` is 0**
