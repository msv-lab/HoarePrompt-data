Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `s1` and `s2` are new input strings; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`. If `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', then `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 2` and if `hd` was originally greater than 0, `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 2`, otherwise `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 1`. If `s1[i]` is not '1' or `s2[i]` is not '0', then `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 1` and `hd` remains `a1 - a2`. `i` is 1; `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' if `res` was incremented.**
