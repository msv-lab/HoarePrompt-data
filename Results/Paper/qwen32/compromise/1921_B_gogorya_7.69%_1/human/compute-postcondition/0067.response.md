Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `s1` is the new input string; `s2` is the new input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2`; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)` plus the number of times `s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'` for `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `hd` has been updated to `a1 - a2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
