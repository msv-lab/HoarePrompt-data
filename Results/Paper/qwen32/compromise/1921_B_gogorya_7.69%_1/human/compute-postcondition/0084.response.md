Output State: **`t` is `t + 1`, `n` is greater than `t + 1`, `s1` and `s2` are the new input strings, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`. If `s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0'`, then `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`. Otherwise, `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`. `hd` is decreased by 1.**

Natural language description: The value of `hd` is decreased by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
