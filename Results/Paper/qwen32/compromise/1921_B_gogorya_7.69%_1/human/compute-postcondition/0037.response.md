Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `s1` is the new input string; `s2` is the new input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in the new `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in the new `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2`; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)` plus the count of positions `i` where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The value of `hd` has been updated to `a1 - a2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
