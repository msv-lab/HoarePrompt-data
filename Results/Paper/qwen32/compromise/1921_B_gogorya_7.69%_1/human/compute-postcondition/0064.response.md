The code snippet provided is:

```python
s2 = input()
```

This line of code assigns the value of the new input string to the variable `s2`. The previous value of `s2` is overwritten by this new input.

Here is the impact on the variables:
- `s2` is now the new input string.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `s1`, `a1`, `a2`, `hd`, `res`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `s1` is the new input string; `s2` is the new input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in the new input string; `a2` is the count of '1's in the new input string; `hd` is `max(0, a1 - a2 - n)`; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)` plus the number of times `s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'` for `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`.**
