The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `t`, `s1`, `s2`, `a1`, `a2`, `hd`, and `res` does not affect whether the loop will execute, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `s1` is the new input string, `s2` is the new input string, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`, `hd` is `a1 - a2`, `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`**
