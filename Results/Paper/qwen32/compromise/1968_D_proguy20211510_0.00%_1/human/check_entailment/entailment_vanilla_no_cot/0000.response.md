Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game for all possible scenarios. Specifically, the logic for simulating the game and calculating scores is flawed. The program attempts to determine the winner based on the maximum possible score each player can achieve, but it does not correctly simulate the game mechanics and does not account for all possible moves and scores.

Here are some issues with the program:
1. The program assumes that if a player reaches the maximum value in the array `a`, they will stay there for the remaining turns. However, the players can choose to move to different positions based on the permutation `p`, which might yield higher scores.
2. The program does not correctly handle cycles in the permutation `p`. If a player enters a cycle, they might not reach the maximum value in the array `a` within `k` turns.
3. The program does not correctly simulate the simultaneous moves of both players. It calculates scores for Bodya and Sasha separately, but the game is played simultaneously, and the players' choices might affect each other.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should simulate the game for both players simultaneously, taking into account all possible moves and scores, and correctly handle cycles in the permutation.
