The variable `ps` is updated to the value of `p[ps - 1]`. Other variables remain unchanged. Specifically, `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps` (before the update), `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `b`, and `s` retain their initial values. The new value of `ps` is determined by the value at the index `ps - 1` in the list `p`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`. If `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, it remains `maxa`; if `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, no changes are made to `a[pb - 1]`. `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa` and no changes are made to `a[ps - 1]`. `founds` is False, `b` contains the value `a[pb - 1]`, and `s` is a list containing the value `a[ps - 1]`.**
