In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only contains the variable `_` which is a common Python convention for a variable that we do not plan to use. Therefore, the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `t`. 

To ensure that the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1, as the loop will not execute if `t` is 0 or negative. Given the constraints, `t` is already guaranteed to be in the range 1 to 10^4, so no adjustment is strictly necessary for the loop to execute. However, to adhere to the requirement of specifying the state, we can confirm that `t` is within the valid range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
