The code snippet `b.append(a[pb - 1])` appends the element at index `pb - 1` of the list `a` to the list `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `i`, `foundb`, and `founds` remain unchanged except for `b`, which now includes the newly appended element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `i` is `i + 1`. If `foundb` and `founds` are both true, `b` has a new element appended which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `s` has a new element appended which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no changes are made to `b` or `s`. `foundb` is True; `b` has a new element appended which is `a[pb - 1]`.**
