The provided Python code snippet modifies the variable `sb` by adding the value of `b[i]` to it. Given the initial state, the value of `sb` is initially `0`, and `i` is `0`. Therefore, after executing the statement `sb += b[i]`, `sb` will be updated to the value of `b[0]`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`b` and `s` will each contain `k` elements or fewer, with the final elements being `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` if the loop breaks early; `foundb` and `founds` will be `True` or `False` based on whether `maxa` was found at `pb` and `ps` positions; `preb` is a list containing one element `[sb + b[i]]`; `pres` is an empty list; `sb` is `b[0]`; `ss` is `0`; `s` must have at least 1 element, `i` is `0`.**
