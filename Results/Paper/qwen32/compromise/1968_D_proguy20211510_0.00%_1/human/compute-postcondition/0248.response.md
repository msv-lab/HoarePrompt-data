The code snippet appends a new element to the list `ptss`. The new element is calculated as `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, `rem` is `k - 2`, `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s`, and `s` is a list of some numbers.

The new element being appended to `ptss` is `pres[1] + (k - 2) * s[1]`. This means the list `ptss` now has an additional element which is the result of this calculation.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s` that must have at least 2 elements, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is a list with an additional element `preb[1] + (k - 2) * b[1]`, `ptss` is a list with an additional element `pres[1] + (k - 2) * s[1]`, `rem` is `k - 2`, `i` is 1**
