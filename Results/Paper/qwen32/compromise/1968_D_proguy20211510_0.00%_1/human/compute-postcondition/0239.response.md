The code snippet appends a new value to the `ptsb` list. The new value is calculated as `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, where `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`. No other variables are directly modified by this code.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s` that must have at least 1 element, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is a list with an additional element `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, `ptss` is an empty list, `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`**.
