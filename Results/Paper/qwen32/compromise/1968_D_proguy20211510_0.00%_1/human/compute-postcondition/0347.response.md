The code snippet `preb.append(sb + b[i])` appends the sum of `sb` and `b[i]` to the list `preb`. The values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, `maxb`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, and `s` remain unchanged. The only change is that `preb` will have a new element, which is the sum of `sb` and `b[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` and `ps` are integers, `preb` is a list with a new element `sb + b[i]` appended, `pres` is an empty list, `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0, `ptsb` and `ptss` are empty lists, `maxs` is undefined, `maxb` is undefined, `p` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` is a list of integers accumulated based on the loop execution, and `s` is a list of integers accumulated based on the loop execution that must have at least 1 element.**
