The code updates the value of `rem` to `k - (i + 1)`. The other variables (`ptsb`, `ptss`, `pres`, `i`) are not modified by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`ptsb` is a list with one additional element `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, `ptss` is a list with one element `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`, `pres` must have at least `i + 2` elements, `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
