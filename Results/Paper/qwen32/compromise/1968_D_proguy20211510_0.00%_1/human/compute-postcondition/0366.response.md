The code snippet appends a calculated value to the list `ptss`. The value is the sum of `pres[i]` and `rem * s[i]`, where `rem` is defined as `k - (i + 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` and `ps` are integers, `preb` is a list with `len(s)` elements representing cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list with at least one element, `sb` is the total sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the total sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is a list with an additional element `preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i]`, `ptss` is a list with an additional element `pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i]`, `maxs` is undefined, `maxb` is undefined, `p` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` is a list of integers accumulated based on the loop execution, `s` is a list of integers accumulated based on the loop execution, `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`**

In simpler terms, the list `ptss` now includes a new element, which is the sum of `pres[i]` and the product of `rem` and `s[i]`. All other variables retain their previous values.
