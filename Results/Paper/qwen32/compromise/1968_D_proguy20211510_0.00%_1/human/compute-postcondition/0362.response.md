The code snippet provided resets `ptsb` and `ptss` to empty lists. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` and `ps` are integers, `preb` is a list with `len(s)` elements representing cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list with `len(s)` elements representing cumulative sums of `s`, `sb` is the total sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the total sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` and `ptss` are empty lists, `maxs` is undefined, `maxb` is undefined, `p` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` is a list of integers accumulated based on the loop execution, and `s` is a list of integers accumulated based on the loop execution.**
