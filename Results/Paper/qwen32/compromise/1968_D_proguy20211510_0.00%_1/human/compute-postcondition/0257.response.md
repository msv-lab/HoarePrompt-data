The given initial state describes several variables and lists, including cumulative sums (`preb` and `pres`), sums of elements (`sb` and `ss`), and lists calculated based on specific formulas (`ptsb` and `ptss`). Additionally, it mentions that `maxs` (the maximum value in `ptss`) is equal to `maxb` (the maximum value in `ptsb`).

The provided `print` statement is:

```python
print('Draw')
```

This statement does not depend on the values of the variables or lists mentioned in the initial state. Instead, it directly prints the string `'Draw'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **Draw**
