Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` and `ps` are integers, `preb` is a list with two elements `[sb + b[i], sb + b[i] + b[i+1]]`, `pres` is a list containing one element `ss + s[i]`, `sb` is `sb + b[i]`, `ss` is `s[i]`, `ptsb` and `ptss` are empty lists, `maxs` is undefined, `maxb` is undefined, `p` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` is a list of integers accumulated based on the loop execution, and `s` is a list of integers accumulated based on the loop execution that must have at least 1 element, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The list `preb` now has an additional element `sb + b[i]` appended to it, making it contain two elements: the original `sb + b[i]` and the newly appended `sb + b[i]`. All other variables retain their previous values.
