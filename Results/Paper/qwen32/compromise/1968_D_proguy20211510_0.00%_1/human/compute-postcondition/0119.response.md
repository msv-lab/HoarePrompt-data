The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(pres)`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `pres`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `new_i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `new_i + 1`. Additionally, the length of `pres` must be at least `new_i + 2` to ensure that the loop can continue executing.

Since the length of `pres` is already given to be at least `new_i + 2`, we only need to adjust `i`.

State: **`ptsb` is a list with two additional elements `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, `ptss` is a list with two elements `pres[i] + rem * s[i]` and `pres[new_i] + rem * s[new_i]`, `pres` must have at least `new_i + 2` elements, `rem` is `k - (new_i + 1)`, `i` is `new_i + 1`**
