Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `founds` is a boolean, `maxs` is the maximum value in the `ptss` list, `maxb` is the maximum value in the `ptsb` list, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `founds` is True, `s` includes an additional element `maxa` and the loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `founds` is set to True and `s` includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]`; otherwise, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]` and `s` includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]`. If `foundb` is True, `b` includes an additional element `maxa`. If `foundb` is False and `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, `foundb` is set to True and `b` includes an additional element `a[pb - 1]`; otherwise, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]` and `b` includes an additional element `a[pb - 1]`. The loop or if statement is broken out of if `foundb` and `founds` are True. The length of `ptsb` is `len(pres) + 1` if `foundb` and `founds` are True; otherwise, `ptsb` retains its initial length.**
