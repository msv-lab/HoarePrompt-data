The code appends a new element to the list `ptsb`. The new element is calculated as `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`. Given that `i` is `new_i + 1` and `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`, the new element becomes `preb[new_i + 1] + (k - (new_i + 1 + 1)) * b[new_i + 1]`, which simplifies to `preb[new_i + 1] + (k - new_i - 2) * b[new_i + 1]`.

Thus, the list `ptsb` now has three elements: the original two elements and the newly appended element.

Output State: **`ptsb` is a list with three elements `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, `preb[new_i + 1] + rem * b[new_i + 1]`, and `preb[new_i + 1] + (k - new_i - 2) * b[new_i + 1]`; `ptss` is a list with two elements `pres[i] + rem * s[i]` and `pres[new_i] + rem * s[new_i]`; `pres` must have at least `new_i + 2` elements; `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`; `i` is `new_i + 1`.**
