The code snippet `s.append(a[ps - 1])` appends the value of `a[ps - 1]` to the list `s`. Given that `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, the list `s` will now contain `maxa` as one of its elements.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer; `preb` is an empty list, `pres` is an empty list, `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0, `ptsb` is an empty list, `ptss` is an empty list, `maxs` is undefined, and `maxb` is undefined; `p` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`. `founds` is `True`, and `s` is a list containing `maxa`. If `foundb` is `True`, then `b` is a list containing two elements `((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)` and `maxa`. If `foundb` is `False`, then `b` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]`. Additionally, `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`.**
