Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Password Composition:**
   - The password must consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. **Ordering Rules:**
   - No digit should come after a letter.
   - All digits should be in non-decreasing order.
   - All letters should be in non-decreasing order.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - The first element of the list is the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, the first element is the length of the password (`n`), and the second element is the password string.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each password, the program initializes two empty lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - It then iterates over each character in the password:
     - If the character is a digit, it is appended to the `digits` list.
     - If the character is a letter, it is appended to the `letters` list.
   - The program then checks for the condition that no digit should come after a letter:
     - It keeps track of the last index where a digit was found (`last_digit_index`).
     - If a letter is found after a digit (i.e., `last_digit_index` is not `-1`), the function immediately returns `'NO'`.
   - The program checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - The program checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If all conditions are satisfied, the function returns `'YES'`; otherwise, it returns `'NO'`.

### Verification Against Sample Input:
Let's verify the program against the sample input:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Password: `12ac`
   - `digits`: `['1', '2']` (sorted)
   - `letters`: `['a', 'c']` (sorted)
   - No digit comes after a letter.
   - Output: `'YES'` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Password: `123wa`
   - `digits`: `['1', '2', '3']` (sorted)
   - `letters`: `['w', 'a']` (not sorted)
   - Output: `'NO'` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Password: `allllmost`
   - `digits`: `[]` (no digits)
   - `letters`: `['a', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'm', 'o', 's', 't']` (sorted)
   - Output: `'YES'` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Password: `ac123`
   - `digits`: `['1', '2', '3']` (sorted)
   - `letters`: `['a', 'c']` (sorted)
   - Digit `1` comes after letter `c`.
   - Output: `'NO'` (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Password: `011679`
   - `digits`: `['0', '1', '1', '6', '7', '9']` (sorted)
   - `letters`: `[]` (no letters)
   - Output: `'YES'` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements all the conditions specified in the problem statement and produces the correct output for the sample input. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
