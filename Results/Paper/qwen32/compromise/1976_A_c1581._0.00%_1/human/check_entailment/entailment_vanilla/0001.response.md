Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. There should be no digit that comes after a letter (i.e., after each letter, there is either another letter or the end of the string).
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - The first element is the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, the program reads the length of the password (`n`) and the password string itself.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program iterates over each test case.
   - For each password, it calls the function `func_1(password)` to check if the password is strong.

3. **Function `func_1(password)`:**
   - **Separating Digits and Letters:**
     - It initializes two empty lists: `digits` and `letters`.
     - It iterates over each character in the password:
       - If the character is a digit, it appends it to the `digits` list.
       - If the character is a letter, it appends it to the `letters` list.
   - **Checking Order of Digits and Letters:**
     - It initializes `last_digit_index` to `-1`.
     - It iterates over each character in the password with its index:
       - If the character is a digit, it updates `last_digit_index` to the current index.
       - If the character is a letter and `last_digit_index` is not `-1` (indicating a digit has been seen before), it returns 'NO' because a letter follows a digit.
   - **Checking Sorted Order:**
     - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
     - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
     - If both conditions are met, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

### Verification:
- The program correctly separates digits and letters and checks if any letter follows a digit.
- It also correctly checks if both the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if a password is strong according to the problem's requirements.

**Correctness: True**
