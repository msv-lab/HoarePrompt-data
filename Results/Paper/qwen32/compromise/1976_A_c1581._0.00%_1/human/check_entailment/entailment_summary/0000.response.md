Reasoning: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if a given password meets Monocarp's criteria for being strong. Here are the key points:

1. **Separation of Digits and Letters**: The program separates digits and letters into two different lists. This helps in checking if all digits appear before any letters.
2. **Order of Digits and Letters**: The program checks if all digits are in non-decreasing order and if all letters are in non-decreasing order.
3. **Digit-Letter Transition Check**: The program ensures that no letter appears before a digit. This is achieved by keeping track of the last index of a digit encountered in the password. If a letter is found after this index, the password is deemed invalid.
4. **Output**: The program outputs "YES" if the password meets all the criteria and "NO" otherwise.

The execution summary confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks the conditions as described. Therefore, the program adheres to the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
