You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of lst is between 2 and 50 inclusive. This list represents the array a for a single test case, with the first element of lst being the integer n (the length of the array), followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.
def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
    #The program returns True if `lst` is already sorted in ascending order, otherwise it returns False.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Breakdown
We need to determine if an array can be sorted in non-descending order by repeatedly performing the operation of splitting any element that is at least 10 into its constituent digits.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Operation Logic**:
    - The program iterates through the array from the second element to the end.
    - It checks if the array is sorted using the `func_1` function.
    - If the array is not sorted, it checks if the current element and the previous element violate the sorted order and if the previous element is at least 10.
    - If both conditions are met, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the array at the appropriate positions.
    - This process is repeated until the end of the array is reached.

3. **Checking Sorted Order**:
    - After processing the array, the program checks if the array is sorted using the `func_1` function.
    - If the array is sorted, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Loop Logic**:
    - The loop only runs once through the array (from the second element to the end). If a split operation is performed, the loop does not re-check the array from the beginning to ensure that the new elements also satisfy the sorted order.
    - The loop should ideally be a while loop that continues until no more split operations are needed or the array is sorted.

2. **Splitting Logic**:
    - The program splits the previous element when it is greater than 10 and greater than the current element. However, this logic is flawed because the split should be performed based on the entire array's sorted order, not just the immediate neighbors.
    - The program should check the entire array's order after each split operation and continue splitting until the array is sorted or no more splits are possible.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
    - The function `func_1` correctly checks if the array is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version.

### Correctness
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by repeatedly splitting elements. The loop logic and the conditions for splitting need to be revised to ensure that the entire array is considered after each split operation.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
