Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the given problem description. We will use the function summary and the original assessment to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to determine if a given list of integers can be sorted in non-descending order by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their constituent digits.

### Program Analysis
The provided program iterates through the list and attempts to split elements if they are greater than 10 and if the list is not sorted. However, there are several issues with the implementation:

1. **Incorrect Splitting Logic**: The program uses integer division (`a // 10`) and modulo (`a % 10`) operations to split a number into two digits. This approach is incorrect for numbers with more than two digits. For example, the number 123 should be split into `[1, 2, 3]`, but the code will only split it into `[12, 3]`.

2. **Inefficient and Incomplete Check**: The program checks if the list is sorted using `func_1`. If the list is not sorted, it attempts to split the previous element. However, this approach is insufficient to guarantee that the list will become sorted. The program does not consider all possible splits and does not handle cases where multiple splits are needed.

3. **Incorrect Loop Logic**: The loop iterates from the second element to the end of the list. If an element needs to be split, it modifies the list, but the loop index does not account for the new elements that are inserted. This can lead to skipping elements or incorrect comparisons.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the list is already sorted or where the list cannot be sorted by any number of splits.

### Function Summary
The function `func_1` checks if a list is sorted in ascending order. It returns `True` if the list is sorted, otherwise `False`.

### Original Assessment
The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the program, particularly the incorrect splitting logic and the inefficient check for sorting. The example provided in the assessment demonstrates a failure of the program to handle a specific case correctly.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified in the original assessment, the program is not correct. It fails to handle numbers with more than two digits correctly and does not guarantee that the list will become sorted after any number of splits.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
