Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of `lst` is between 2 and 50 inclusive. The first element of `lst` is the integer `n` (the length of the array), followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The function returns `True` if the list `lst` (excluding the first element) is already sorted in ascending order, otherwise it returns `False`.**
