Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Total Points Check**: The program first checks if the total points (`p1 + p2 + p3`) are even. This is correct because every game results in a total of 2 points being awarded (either 2-0 or 1-1). If the total points are odd, it's impossible to have a valid set of games, so the program correctly returns `-1`.

2. **Total Matches Calculation**: The program calculates the total number of matches that must have been played by dividing the total points by 2. This is also correct.

3. **Maximum Matches Check**: The program checks if the total number of matches is more than 3 or if the highest score `p3` is greater than the total number of matches. This is also correct because if `p3` is greater than the total number of matches, it means one player has more points than the total number of matches, which is impossible. Similarly, since there are only three players, the maximum number of matches is 3 (each pair can play at most once).

4. **Draws Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. This formula is intended to determine the number of points that are not due to wins (i.e., points due to draws). The formula seems correct because:
   - `2 * (p3 - p2)` accounts for the points `p3` has over `p2` due to wins.
   - `2 * (p3 - p1)` accounts for the points `p3` has over `p1` due to wins.
   - Subtracting these from the total points leaves the points that must be due to draws.

5. **Draws Validation**: The program checks if the calculated number of points due to draws (`egalites`) is negative. If it is, the scores are inconsistent, and the program correctly returns `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates the number of draws by dividing `egalites` by 2 (since each draw contributes 2 points).

However, there is an issue in the test cases provided in the program. The test case `(0, 2, 3)` in `cas_de_test` should be `(1, 1, 1)` as per the problem statement's example 3, which should return `-1` because it's impossible to have scores of 0, 2, and 3.

Given the above analysis, the program logic seems correct, but the provided test cases need to be accurate for the program to be considered correct. Since the test case `(0, 2, 3)` is incorrect, the program's correctness is dependent on the input data being accurate. Assuming the test cases were correct, the program would be correct.

Correctness: **False** (due to the incorrect test case in the provided input)

If we correct the test case to `(1, 1, 1)` and re-run the program, then:

Correctness: **True**
