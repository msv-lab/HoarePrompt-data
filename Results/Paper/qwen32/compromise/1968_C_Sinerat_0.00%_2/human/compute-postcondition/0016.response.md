The code snippet `a = [0] * n` reassigns the list `a` to be a new list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0. This means the previous definition of `a` where `a[0]` was 500 and subsequent elements were based on the sum of previous elements and values from list `x` is overwritten.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the integer input by the user; `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0.**
