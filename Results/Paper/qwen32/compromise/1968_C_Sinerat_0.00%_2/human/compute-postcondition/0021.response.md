The given code snippet updates the list `a` by setting `a[i]` to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`. Given the initial state, `a[0]` is 500, and `a[i]` for `i > 0` is initially defined as `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`. The code snippet provided is just a single update operation for `a[i]`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 before the code snippet, the operation `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` will update the next element in the list `a` based on the previous element and the corresponding element in `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1, `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 500 and `a[i]` for `i > 0` is updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` after the operation, `i` is incremented by 1.**

In simple terms, the list `a` is updated such that the current element `a[i]` is now the sum of the previous element `a[i - 1]` and the corresponding element `x[i - 1]` from the list `x`. The value of `i` is also incremented by 1.
