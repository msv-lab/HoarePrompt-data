To determine what will be printed by the `print(*a)` statement, let's break down the initial state and how the list `a` is constructed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this task.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 500, and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.

2. **Construction of List `a`:**
   - The first element of `a` is explicitly set to 500.
   - Each subsequent element of `a` is the sum of the previous element and the corresponding element in `x`. Specifically:
     - `a[1] = a[0] + x[0] = 500 + x[0]`
     - `a[2] = a[1] + x[1] = (500 + x[0]) + x[1] = 500 + x[0] + x[1]`
     - This pattern continues, so `a[i] = 500 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[i-1]`.

3. **Output of `print(*a)`:**
   - The `print(*a)` statement will print all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.
   - The first element is always 500.
   - Each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the previous element and the elements from the list `x`.

Given this information, the output will be a sequence of numbers starting with 500, followed by the cumulative sums as described.

Output: **500, 500 + x[0], 500 + x[0] + x[1], ..., 500 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2] (where x is the list of integers obtained from the input)**
