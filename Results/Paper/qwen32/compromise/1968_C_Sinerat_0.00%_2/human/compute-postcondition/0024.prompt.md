Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the integer input by the user; `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of length `n` with the first element set to 500 and the rest of the elements initialized to 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1; `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 500 and `a[i]` for `i > 0` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1, `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 500 and `a[i]` for `i > 0` is updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` after the operation, `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1, `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 500 and `a[i]` for `i > 0` is updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` after the operation, `i` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
