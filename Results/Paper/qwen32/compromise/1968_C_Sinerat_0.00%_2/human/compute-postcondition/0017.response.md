The code snippet sets the first element of the list `a` to 500. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `x`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the integer input by the user; `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of length `n` with the first element set to 500 and the rest of the elements initialized to 0.**
