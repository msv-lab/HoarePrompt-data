To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop starts with `i` initialized to 1 and continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1
- `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input
- `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 500 and `a[i]` for `i > 0` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`

The loop statement is:
```
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken on a value from 1 to `n-1`. For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` remains unchanged.

Let's assume that in the previous iteration, `i` was `k` (where `1 <= k < n`). After the loop body executes, `i` would be `k + 1` for the next iteration. The value of `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `t` remains the same
- `n` remains the same
- `x` remains the same
- `a` remains the same
- `i` is incremented by 1

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1, `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 500 and `a[i]` for `i > 0` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, `i` is incremented by 1**
