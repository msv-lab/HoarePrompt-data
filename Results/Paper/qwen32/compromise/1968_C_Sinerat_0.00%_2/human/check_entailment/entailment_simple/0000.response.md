Reasoning:
The provided program aims to construct an array `a` based on the given constraints and conditions. The program initializes the first element of `a` to 500 and then iteratively constructs the subsequent elements by adding the corresponding values from the array `x` to the previous element of `a`. This approach ensures that each `a[i]` is greater than `a[i-1]` and, by construction, `a[i] % a[i-1]` equals `x[i-1]`.

Let's break down the logic:
- The first element `a[0]` is set to 500, which is within the allowed range (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).
- For each subsequent element `a[i]` (where i ranges from 1 to n-1), the program sets `a[i]` to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`. Since `x[i-1]` is at least 1, `a[i]` will always be greater than `a[i-1]`.
- The modulo operation `a[i] % a[i-1]` will yield `x[i-1]` because `a[i]` is constructed as `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`. This satisfies the condition `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}`.

The program processes each test case independently and prints the constructed array `a` for each case.

Correctness: **True**

The program correctly constructs the array `a` according to the problem statement and constraints. It ensures that for each `i` from 2 to `n`, `a[i] % a[i-1]` equals `x[i-1]`, and all elements of `a` are within the valid range.
