You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
One of the days of the hike coincided with a holiday, so in the evening at the
camp, it was decided to arrange a festive fireworks display. For this purpose,
the organizers of the hike bought two installations for launching fireworks
and a huge number of shells for launching.

Both installations are turned on simultaneously. The first installation
launches fireworks every a minutes (i.e., after a, 2 \cdot a, 3 \cdot a, \dots
minutes after launch). The second installation launches fireworks every b
minutes (i.e., after b, 2 \cdot b, 3 \cdot b, \dots minutes after launch).

Each firework is visible in the sky for m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., if a
firework was launched after x minutes after the installations were turned on,
it will be visible every minute from x to x + m , inclusive. If one firework
was launched m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one
minute.

What is the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the
same time?

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow the
descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains integers a , b , m (1 \le
a, b, m \le 10^{18} ) — the frequency of launching for the first installation,
the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky.

Output

For each set of input data, output a single number — the maximum number of
fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

Note

In the first set of input data, the fireworks are visible in the sky for 5
minutes. Since the first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and
the second one every 7 minutes, two fireworks launched from the same
installation will not be visible in the sky at the same time. At the same
time, after 7 minutes from the start of the holiday, one firework from the
first and one from the second camp will be visible. Thus, it is possible to
see no more than 2 fireworks simultaneously.

In the third set of input data, 17 fireworks will be visible after 112
minutes:

  * 9 fireworks launched from the first installation at times [56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112 ]; 
  * 8 fireworks launched from the second installation at times [56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112 ].

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if m < a or m < b:
            print(2)
        else:
            print(m // a + m // b + 2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of three positive integers a, b, and m (1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18), where a and b represent the frequencies of launching fireworks for the first and second installations, respectively, and m represents the duration (in minutes) that each firework is visible in the sky after launch. There are t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) such test cases.

            print(2)
        else:
            print(m // a + m // b + 2)
        
    #State: the sequence of printed results for each test case, which is either `2` or `m // a + m // b + 2` depending on the condition `m < a or m < b`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

**1. Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have two installations launching fireworks at different intervals: every `a` minutes and every `b` minutes.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch.
   - We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously in the sky.

**2. Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values `a`, `b`, and `m`.
   - The program then checks if `m` is less than either `a` or `b`. If so, it outputs `2`.
   - If `m` is not less than either `a` or `b`, it calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously as `m // a + m // b + 2`.

**3. Evaluating the Logic:**
   - **Case 1: `m < a` or `m < b`**
     - If `m` is less than either `a` or `b`, the fireworks launched by the installation with the longer interval (`a` or `b`) will never overlap with the fireworks from the other installation in terms of visibility.
     - The maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously would be `2`, one from each installation.
     - The program correctly handles this case.

   - **Case 2: `m >= a` and `m >= b`**
     - If `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`, the fireworks from both installations can overlap in terms of visibility.
     - The number of fireworks from the first installation that can be visible at the same time is `m // a + 1` (including the one launched at `m`).
     - Similarly, the number of fireworks from the second installation that can be visible at the same time is `m // b + 1`.
     - However, the program calculates `m // a + m // b + 2`, which overcounts the fireworks.
     - The correct calculation should be `m // a + m // b + 1` (since the fireworks launched at `m` from both installations would be counted twice in the current formula).

### Conclusion:
The program incorrectly calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously when `m >= a` and `m >= b` by overcounting.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
