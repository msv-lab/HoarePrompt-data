Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `a`, `b`, and `m` are three positive integers each with values between 1 and 10^18, and there are `t` such test cases.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the integer input, while the variables `a`, `b`, and `m` retain their initial states as described in the initial conditions. The number of test cases `t` is now known, but the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `m` for each test case remain unspecified.
