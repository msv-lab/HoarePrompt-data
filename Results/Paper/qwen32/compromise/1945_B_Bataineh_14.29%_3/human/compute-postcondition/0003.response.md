Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. Here, `a` and `b` represent the frequencies of launching fireworks for the first and second installations, respectively, and `m` represents the duration (in minutes) that each firework is visible in the sky after launch. For each test case, the function returns the total number of minutes during which fireworks are visible in the sky.**
