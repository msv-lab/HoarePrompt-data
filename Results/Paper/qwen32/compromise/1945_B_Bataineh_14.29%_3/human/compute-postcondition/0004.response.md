Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. It calculates and prints the total number of minutes during which fireworks are visible in the sky for each test case. If the duration `m` is less than either `a` or `b`, it prints `2`. Otherwise, it prints the sum of the integer divisions of `m` by `a` and `m` by `b`, plus `2`.**
