Postcondition: **`tree` is a deque containing all `n` nodes in a single path from one leaf to the other, `empty` is False, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, `moves` is a list of minimum values between `t` and the distances from `idx` to both ends of `tree`, and all elements in `moves` are even numbers.**
