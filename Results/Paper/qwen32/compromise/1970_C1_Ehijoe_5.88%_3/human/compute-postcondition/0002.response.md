The code snippet provided only contains the line `empty = True`, which sets the variable `empty` to `True`. None of the other variables (`n`, `t`, `tree`, or the edges and starting node information) are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `tree` is an empty deque. `empty` is True.**
