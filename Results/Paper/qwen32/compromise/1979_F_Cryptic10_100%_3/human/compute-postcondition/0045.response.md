The code snippet appends a tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. This means that `ops` will now contain the additional tuple. Other variables remain unchanged as per the given information.

Output State: **`t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to an integer value greater than 2 with `v1` removed, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)`, `p1` is a list containing the elements of `vx` (with `v1` removed) and additional elements from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2`, `p2` is a list containing elements from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2`, `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`. The current value of `v2` is greater than 0.**
