Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers with 1 or 2 elements, `ops` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed, `p1` is a list containing the elements of `vx`, and `p2` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
    (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers with 1 or 2 elements, `ops` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed and must contain at least one tuple, `p1` is a list containing the elements of `vx` with `v1` appended if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, or `p1` remains unchanged if `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`, `p2` is an empty list with `v1` appended if `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`, or `p2` remains unchanged if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers with 1 or 2 elements, `ops` is a list of tuples containing at least one more tuple before the one that was just processed, `(v1, v2)` is the next tuple in reverse order from `ops`, and `v1` is appended to `p2` if `p1[-1] == v2`, otherwise `v1` is appended to `p1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers with 1 or 2 elements, `ops` is a list of tuples containing at least two more tuples before the one that was just processed, and `v1` is appended to `p2` if `p1[-1] == v2`, otherwise `v1` is appended to `p1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
