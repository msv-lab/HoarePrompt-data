The code snippet provided appends two tuples to the list `ops`. The tuples are `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`. This action modifies the `ops` list by adding these two tuples at the end.

The initial state specifies that:
- `t` is an integer from 1 to 1000.
- `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to an integer value greater than 2 with `v1` and `v3` removed, and `len(vx)` is greater than 1.
- `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`.
- `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)` and has been removed from `vx`.
- If `v2` is greater than 0, `ops` contains the original elements plus the tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `ops` contains the original elements plus the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`.
- `p1` is a list containing the elements of `vx` (with `v1` and `v3` removed if `v2` is less than or equal to 0) and additional elements from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2`.
- `p2` is a list containing elements from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2`.

After executing the code snippet `ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`, the `ops` list will include the two new tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` appended to it. The other variables (`t`, `vx`, `v1`, `v2`, `v3`, `p1`, and `p2`) remain unchanged in terms of their definitions and values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to an integer value greater than 2 with `v1` and `v3` removed, and `len(vx)` is greater than 1; `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`; `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)` and has been removed from `vx`; if `v2` is greater than 0, `ops` contains the original elements plus the tuple `(v1, v2)` and the additional tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `ops` contains the original elements plus the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` twice; `p1` is a list containing the elements of `vx` (with `v1` and `v3` removed if `v2` is less than or equal to 0) and additional elements from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2`; `p2` is a list containing elements from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2`.**
