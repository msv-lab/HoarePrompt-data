Postcondition: **`t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to an integer value greater than 2 with `v1` removed, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is a list containing the elements of `vx` (with `v1` removed) and additional elements from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2`, `p2` is a list containing elements from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2`, `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`. The current value of `v2` is greater than 0.**
