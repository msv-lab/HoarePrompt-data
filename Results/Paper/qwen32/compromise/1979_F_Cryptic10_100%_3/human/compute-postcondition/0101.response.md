The code snippet `ops += [(v1, v2)]` appends a new tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. 

Given the initial state, the only variable affected by this code is `ops`. The values of `t`, `v1`, `v2`, `vx`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged. The specific values of `v1` and `v2` are not altered by this operation; they are simply added as a new element to the list `ops`.

Therefore, the updated state is that `ops` now includes an additional tuple `(v1, v2)` at the end of the list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer from 1 to 1000; `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`; `vx` is a set of integers with more than 2 elements after removing `v1` if `v2` is greater than 0, or after removing `v3` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0, and `v1` has been removed from `vx`; `ops` contains an additional tuple `(v1, v2)` if `v2` is greater than 0, or `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0, plus the new tuple `(v1, v2)`; `p1` includes the initial elements of `vx` plus any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] != v2`; `p2` includes any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] == v2`; `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0.**
