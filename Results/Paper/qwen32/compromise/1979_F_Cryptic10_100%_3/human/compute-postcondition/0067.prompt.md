Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the integer value provided by the input, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is a list containing the elements of `vx` and additional elements from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2`, and `p2` is a list containing elements from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2`.
Code of the loop:
while len(vx) > 2:
    v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
    vx.remove(v1)
    if v2 > 0:
        ops += [(v1, v2)]
    else:
        v3, _ = q(0)
        vx.remove(v3)
        ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to an integer value greater than 2 with `v1` removed (and `v3` removed if `v2` is less than or equal to 0), `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)` if `v2` is greater than 0, or the tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `p1` is a list containing the elements of `vx` (with `v1` and `v3` removed if `v2` is less than or equal to 0) and additional elements from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2`, `p2` is a list containing elements from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2`, `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, and `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to an integer value greater than 2 with `v1` and `v3` (if `v2` is less than or equal to 0) removed, and `len(vx)` is greater than 2. If `v2` is greater than 0, `ops` contains the original elements plus the tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `ops` contains the original elements plus the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, and `v3` is removed from `vx`. `p1` is a list containing the elements of `vx` (with `v1` and `v3` removed if `v2` is less than or equal to 0) and additional elements from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2`. `p2` is a list containing elements from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2`. `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, and `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to an integer value greater than 2 with `v1` (and `v3` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0) removed, and `len(vx)` is greater than 1. `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`. `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0. If `v2` is greater than 0, `ops` includes the original elements plus the tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `ops` includes the original elements plus the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, and `v3` is removed from `vx`. `p1` is a list containing the elements of `vx` (with `v1` and `v3` removed if `v2` is less than or equal to 0) and additional elements from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2`. `p2` is a list containing elements from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
