Postcondition: **`t` is an integer from 1 to 1000. If `v2` > 0, then `vx` is a set of integers with at least 2 elements (after removing `v1`), `ops` is a list that now includes the tuple `(v1, v2)`, and `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`. Otherwise, `vx` is a set of integers with at least 1 element (after removing `v1` and `v3`), `ops` is a list with two additional elements `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`, `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, and `v3` is the first value returned by `q(0)` and has been removed from `vx`.**
