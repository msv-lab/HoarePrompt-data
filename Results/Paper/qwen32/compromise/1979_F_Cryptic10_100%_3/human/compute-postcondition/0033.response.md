To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables that appear in the loop head: `(v1, v2)` and `ops`.

Given the loop:
```python
for (v1, v2) in ops[::-1]:
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop iterates over the reversed list `ops`. The variables `v1` and `v2` are assigned the elements of the tuples from `ops` in reverse order.

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer from 1 to 1000.
- `vx` is a set of integers with 1 or 2 elements.
- `ops` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed and must contain at least one tuple.
- `p1` is a list containing the elements of `vx` with `v1` appended if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, or `p1` remains unchanged if `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`.
- `p2` is an empty list with `v1` appended if `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`, or `p2` remains unchanged if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`.

To execute one more iteration, `ops` must still have tuples left to iterate over in reverse order. Therefore, `ops` must contain at least one more tuple.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `(v1, v2)` was the last tuple processed from `ops` in reverse order.

For the next iteration, the next tuple in reverse order from `ops` should be assigned to `(v1, v2)`.

Let's denote the next tuple in reverse order as `(v1_new, v2_new)`. This means `ops` must have at least one more tuple before the one that was just processed.

State at the start of the next iteration:
- `t` remains the same.
- `vx` remains the same.
- `ops` must contain at least one more tuple before the one that was just processed.
- `(v1, v2)` will be assigned the next tuple in reverse order from `ops`.

State: **`t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers with 1 or 2 elements, `ops` is a list of tuples containing at least one more tuple before the one that was just processed, `(v1, v2)` is the next tuple in reverse order from `ops`**.
