Output State: **`t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers with exactly 2 elements after removing `v1`, `ops` is a list that contains one tuple `(v1, v2)` if `v2` is greater than 0, or `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `p1` is a list containing the initial elements of `vx` plus any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] != v2`, and `p2` is a list containing any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] == v2`.**

In natural language: The set `vx` now contains exactly 2 elements after removing `v1`. All other variables (`t`, `ops`, `p1`, `p2`, `v1`, `v2`) remain unchanged.
