To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop progresses and under what conditions it terminates. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` and `m` are input integers with `n >= 1` and `m >= 1`.
   - `x = 1`
   - `cnt = 0`
   - `y = 1`

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - If `gcd(x, y) == 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.
   - `y` is incremented by 1.

4. **Progression of the Loop**:
   - **First Iteration** (`y = 2`):
     - Check if `(1 + 2) * 1 <= n` and `(1 + 2) * 2 <= m` → `3 <= n` and `6 <= m`.
     - If `gcd(1, 2) == 1` (which is true), then `cnt += min(n // 3, m // 6)`.
   - **Second Iteration** (`y = 3`):
     - Check if `(1 + 3) * 1 <= n` and `(1 + 3) * 3 <= m` → `4 <= n` and `12 <= m`.
     - If `gcd(1, 3) == 1` (which is true), then `cnt += min(n // 4, m // 12)`.
   - **Third Iteration** (`y = 4`):
     - Check if `(1 + 4) * 1 <= n` and `(1 + 4) * 4 <= m` → `5 <= n` and `20 <= m`.
     - If `gcd(1, 4) == 1` (which is true), then `cnt += min(n // 5, m // 20)`.

5. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when either `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`.

Given the provided output states after the first three iterations, let's assume `n` and `m` are such that the loop can run at least three times. We'll generalize the final state based on these conditions.

### Final Output State Calculation:
- **After the first iteration** (`y = 2`):
  - `cnt` is incremented by `min(n // 3, m // 6)`.
- **After the second iteration** (`y = 3`):
  - `cnt` is incremented by `min(n // 4, m // 12)`.
- **After the third iteration** (`y = 4`):
  - `cnt` is incremented by `min(n // 5, m // 20)`.

The loop will continue until `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`. Since `x` remains 1 throughout the loop, the loop will terminate when `y` becomes large enough such that `(1 + y) * y > m`.

### General Final State:
- `x` remains 1.
- `y` will be the smallest integer such that `(1 + y) * y > m`.
- `cnt` will be the sum of `min(n // ((1 + y') * 1), m // ((1 + y') * y'))` for all `y'` from 2 to `y-1` where `gcd(1, y') == 1`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `n = 10` and `m = 20` for concreteness:
- After `y = 2`: `cnt += min(10 // 3, 20 // 6) = min(3, 3) = 3`.
- After `y = 3`: `cnt += min(10 // 4, 20 // 12) = min(2, 1) = 1`.
- After `y = 4`: `cnt += min(10 // 5, 20 // 20) = min(2, 1) = 1`.
- The loop terminates because `(1 + 5) * 5 = 30 > 20`.

Thus, `cnt = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`x = 1`, `y = 5`, `cnt = 5`**

This means after all iterations, `x` remains 1, `y` is 5 (since `(1 + 5) * 5 > 20`), and `cnt` is 5.
