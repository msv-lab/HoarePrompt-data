Functionality: **The function `func_2` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two positive integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, the function performs some operation (not detailed here) and returns a result for each pair of `n` and `m`. The function handles up to 10,000 test cases, with each `n` and `m` being positive integers no greater than 2,000,000.**
