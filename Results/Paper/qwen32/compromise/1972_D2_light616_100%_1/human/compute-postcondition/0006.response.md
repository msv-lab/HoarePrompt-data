To determine the output state, we need to consider the given initial state and the code snippet. Here's the breakdown:

- Initial State: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `_` is incremented by 1.
- Code Snippet: `func_1()`

Since the function `func_1()` is called, we need to know what `func_1()` does to determine its impact on the variables. However, since the definition of `func_1()` is not provided, we can only assume that it may modify the state in some way. Without knowing the specifics of `func_1()`, we can't determine the exact changes to the variables.

However, based on the given information, we know that `_` is incremented by 1. Assuming `func_1()` does not affect `_` (since it's not specified), the only change we can confidently state is the increment of `_`.

Therefore, the Output State would be:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `_` is incremented by 1.**

This means that `_` has been incremented by 1, and `t` remains unchanged as per the given initial state.
