In the given for loop, the loop variable is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use within the loop body. The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, and the loop variable `_` would have taken on the value of the current iteration index (starting from 0).

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment the loop variable `_` by 1. Since `_` is not used inside the loop, its value doesn't affect the logic of the program other than controlling the number of iterations.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop variable `_` at the start of the first iteration is 0.
2. After each iteration, `_` is incremented by 1.
3. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` was some value `k` (where `0 <= k < t`).
4. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be `k + 1`.

Since `t` remains constant throughout the loop, it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4**. The loop variable `_` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
