To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop statement. The loop condition is `x * x <= n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is 3
- `y` is 6 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `cnt` is 9 (not relevant to the loop condition)

The loop will continue to execute as long as `x * x` is less than or equal to `n`. Let's calculate `x * x`:
- `x * x = 3 * 3 = 9`

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 9. Since `x` is already 3, the only variable we can adjust to ensure the loop executes again is `n`.

Therefore, `n` must be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 9.

State: **`x` is 3, `y` is 6, `cnt` is 9, `n` must be greater than or equal to 9**
