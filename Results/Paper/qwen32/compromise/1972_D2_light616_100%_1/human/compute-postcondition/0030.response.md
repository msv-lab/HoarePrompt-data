Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 3, `cnt` is 7 if the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, otherwise `cnt` remains 6. `n` must be at least 8, and `m` must be at least 8.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `y` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `x`, `cnt`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. The condition for `cnt` to be 7 or 6 is re-evaluated based on the new value of `y`.
