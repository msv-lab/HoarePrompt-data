To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop continues to execute and how the variables change with each iteration.

### Loop Analysis:
- **Initial State:** `x = 2`, `y = 1`, `cnt = 5`, `n >= 4`
- **Loop Condition:** `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`
- **Loop Body:**
  - If `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, increment `cnt` by `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.
  - Increment `y` by 1.

### Iteration Details:
- **After 1st Iteration:**
  - `x = 2`, `y = 2`, `cnt = 6` if `gcd(2, 2) == 1` (which is false, so `cnt` remains 5). But the problem states it becomes 6, indicating `gcd(2, 2) == 1` was considered true for this specific case.
  - Conditions: `n >= 6`, `m >= 3`.

- **After 2nd Iteration:**
  - `x = 2`, `y = 3`, `cnt = 7` if `gcd(2, 3) == 1` (which is true).
  - Conditions: `n >= 8`, `m >= 8`.

- **After 3rd Iteration:**
  - `x = 2`, `y = 4`, `cnt = 8` if `gcd(2, 4) == 1` (which is false, so `cnt` remains 7). But the problem states it becomes 8, indicating `gcd(2, 4) == 1` was considered true for this specific case.
  - Conditions: `n >= 10`, `m >= 15`.

### Continuing the Loop:
- **4th Iteration:**
  - `x = 2`, `y = 5`
  - Check conditions:
    - `(2 + 5) * 2 = 14 <= n` → `n >= 14`
    - `(2 + 5) * 5 = 35 <= m` → `m >= 35`
  - Since `gcd(2, 5) == 1`:
    - `cnt += min(n // 14, m // 35)`
    - Assuming `n >= 14` and `m >= 35`, let's take `n = 14` and `m = 35` for simplicity.
    - `cnt += min(14 // 14, 35 // 35) = min(1, 1) = 1`
    - `cnt = 8 + 1 = 9`

- **5th Iteration:**
  - `x = 2`, `y = 6`
  - Check conditions:
    - `(2 + 6) * 2 = 16 <= n` → `n >= 16`
    - `(2 + 6) * 6 = 48 <= m` → `m >= 48`
  - Since `gcd(2, 6) == 2` (false):
    - `cnt` remains 9.
  - The loop terminates because `(2 + 6) * 6 > m` for `m < 48`.

### Final Output State:
- `x = 2`
- `y = 6`
- `cnt = 9`
- `n` must be at least 16, `m` must be at least 35.

Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 6, `cnt` is 9.**
