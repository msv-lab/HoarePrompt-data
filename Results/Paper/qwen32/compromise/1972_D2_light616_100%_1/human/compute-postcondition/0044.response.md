To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head:

```
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
    # the loop body is omit
```

Given the current state:
- `x` is 3
- `y` is 2
- `n` is greater than or equal to 12
- `m` is greater than or equal to 4
- The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1
- `cnt` is `9 + min(n // 12, m // 4)`

Let's evaluate the conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` with the given values:

1. `(x + y) * x <= n`
   - Substituting the values: `(3 + 2) * 3 <= n`
   - Simplifying: `5 * 3 <= n`
   - Result: `15 <= n`
   
2. `(x + y) * y <= m`
   - Substituting the values: `(3 + 2) * 2 <= m`
   - Simplifying: `5 * 2 <= m`
   - Result: `10 <= m`

From these evaluations, we see that for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 15 and `m` must be at least 10. The current state specifies that `n` is greater than or equal to 12 and `m` is greater than or equal to 4, which are not sufficient.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `n` must be at least 15
- `m` must be at least 10

No other variables in the loop head need to be adjusted.

State: **`x` is 3, `y` is 2, `n` must be at least 15, `m` must be at least 10, the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, and `cnt` is `9 + min(n // 12, m // 4)`**
