To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider how the loop progresses and what changes occur with each iteration.

The given loop is:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()
```

- `t` is the total number of test cases, which determines the number of times the loop will run.
- The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used as a counter in the loop, which gets incremented automatically with each iteration.

From the provided output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop runs `t` times, and the variable `_` increments by 1 with each iteration.

After all iterations (i.e., when `_` has reached `t`), the loop will terminate. The value of `_` will be equal to `t` at the end of the loop, but since `_` is a throwaway variable, its final value is not typically relevant outside the loop context.

The key point here is that the loop will have executed exactly `t` times, and the function `func_1()` will have been called `t` times.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations is:

Output State: **the loop has executed `t` times, and `func_1()` has been called `t` times.**

In natural language: After all iterations, the loop will have completed running `t` times, and the function `func_1()` will have been invoked `t` times.
