t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) where n is even, followed by two strings each of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The test_cases parameter is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n and two strings representing the two rows of the grid.
