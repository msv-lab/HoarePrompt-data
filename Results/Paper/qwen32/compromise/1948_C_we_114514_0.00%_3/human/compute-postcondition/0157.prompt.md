Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one more tuple after the first one, `n` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is False, and `results` is a list containing the strings 'NO' and either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether `reachable_second_row` was True or False.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if reachable_first_row:
        if row1[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True
        else:
            reachable_first_row = False
            if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                reachable_second_row = True
    if reachable_second_row:
        if row2[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one more tuple after the first one, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`. If `reachable_second_row` is True, then `results` is a list containing the strings 'NO' and 'YES'. If `reachable_second_row` is False, then `results` remains unchanged. `j` remains unchanged. If `reachable_second_row` is True and `j` equals `n - 1`, then `row2[j]` is `'>'`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one more tuple after the first one, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `j` is incremented by 1. If `reachable_first_row` is True and `j` equals `n - 1`, `reachable_second_row` is True and `results` is a list containing the strings 'NO' and 'YES'. If `reachable_first_row` is True and `j` is less than `n - 1`, `reachable_second_row` is True if `row1[j]` equals `'>'` or `row2[j]` equals `'>'`. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged. If `reachable_first_row` is False, then `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one more tuple after the first one, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `j` is 1. If `reachable_second_row` is True, then `reachable_first_row` is True if `row2[j] == '>'` and `j == n - 1`. Otherwise, the values of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged. If `reachable_second_row` is False, the values of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
