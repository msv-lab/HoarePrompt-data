Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one more tuple after the first one, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is True, `results` is a list containing the strings 'NO' and 'YES', `row1[j]` is `'>'`, and the current value of `j` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `reachable_second_row` has been changed to `True`. The other variables remain unchanged. The `results` list now contains 'NO' and 'YES' because `reachable_second_row` was set to `True`.
