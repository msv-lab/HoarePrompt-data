Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple, `n` is 4, `row1` is "<<", `row2` is ">><<", `reachable_first_row` is False, and `reachable_second_row` is either True or False. If `reachable_second_row` is True, `results` is a list containing the string 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` is a list containing the string 'NO'.**
