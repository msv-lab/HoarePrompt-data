Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one more tuple after the first one, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `j` is incremented by 1. If `reachable_first_row` is True and `j` equals `n - 1`, `reachable_second_row` is True and `results` is a list containing the strings 'NO' and 'YES'. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block, taking into account the conditions specified in the precondition and the behavior described in the if part.
