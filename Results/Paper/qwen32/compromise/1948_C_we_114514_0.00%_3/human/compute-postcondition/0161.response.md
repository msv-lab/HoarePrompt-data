The code snippet appends the string 'NO' to the `results` list. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `row1`, `row2`, `j`, `reachable_first_row`, `reachable_second_row`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one more tuple after the first one, `n` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `j` is `n-1`, `reachable_first_row` is True if the last character of `row1` is '>' and all previous conditions were met, otherwise False, `reachable_second_row` is False, `results` is a list containing the strings 'NO', 'NO', and 'NO'**.
