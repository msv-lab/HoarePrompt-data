Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 4, `row1` is `"<<"`, `row2` is `">><<"` and `reachable_second_row` is `True`. `reachable_first_row` retains its initial value (either `True` or `False`). If `reachable_second_row` is `True`, it implies that `row2[j]` is `'>'` when `j` is equal to `n - 1` (which is 3). If `reachable_second_row` is `False`, then the else part does not execute, and `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged.**
