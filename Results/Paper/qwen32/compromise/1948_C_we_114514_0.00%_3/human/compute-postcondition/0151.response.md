Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one more tuple after the first one, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `j` is 1. If `row1[j] == '>'` and `j` equals `n - 1`, `reachable_second_row` is True. If `row1[j] != '>'` and `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`, then `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` is False. If `row1[j] != '>'` and `j` equals `n - 1`, `reachable_first_row` is False.**
