Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one more tuple after the first one, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is False, and `results` is a list containing the strings 'NO' and either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether `reachable_second_row` was True or False. Additionally, `row1[j]` is not equal to '>', `j` is less than `n - 1`, and `row2[j]` is equal to '>'**.
