Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly determines whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Condition `n <= k`**: If the number of parts `n` is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint `k`, then Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color. Hence, the program correctly prints 'NO' in this case.

2. **Condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`**: This condition checks if the number of parts that cannot be painted uniquely by Alice (i.e., `n - math.ceil(n / m)`) is less than `k`. Here, `math.ceil(n / m)` represents the maximum number of parts that can be painted with different colors. If the remaining parts (those that would have to be painted with the same color if Alice uses all `m` colors) are fewer than `k`, Bob can repaint those parts to make all parts the same color. Thus, the program correctly prints 'NO' in this case.

3. **Otherwise**: If neither of the above conditions is met, it means Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot repaint just `k` parts to make all parts the same color. Therefore, the program correctly prints 'YES' in this case.

The program handles all edge cases as per the problem statement and the provided examples. There are no inputs that would cause the program to produce an incorrect output based on the given problem description.
