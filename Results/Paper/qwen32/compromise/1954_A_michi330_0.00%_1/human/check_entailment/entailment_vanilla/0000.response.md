Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
- **Alice** paints a ribbon of `n` parts using `m` colors.
- **Bob** can repaint at most `k` parts to any color he chooses.
- The goal is to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

### Conditions for Alice's Victory:
- If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color, so Alice loses.
- If `n > k`, Alice needs to ensure that Bob cannot repaint `k` parts to make all parts the same color. This is possible if Alice can distribute the colors in such a way that no single color appears more than `n - k` times. 

### Mathematical Insight:
- If `n - ceil(n / m) < k`, it means that even if Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible, Bob can still repaint `k` parts to make all parts the same color. 
- `ceil(n / m)` is the maximum number of parts that can have the same color if colors are distributed as evenly as possible. If `n - ceil(n / m) < k`, it means Bob can change `k` parts to make all parts the same color.

### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
- It then checks if `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO' (Bob can make all parts the same color).
- Otherwise, it prints 'YES' (Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts the same color).

### Verification with Examples:
1. **First Test Case:**
   - `n = 1`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`
   - `n <= k` is true, so the output is 'NO'.
   
2. **Second Test Case:**
   - `n = 5`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 5 = 0 < k` is true, so the output is 'NO'.
   
3. **Third Test Case:**
   - `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 1`
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2 >= k` is false, so the output is 'YES'.
   
4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 2`
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2 >= k` is false, so the output is 'NO'.
   
5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - `n = 5`, `m = 5`, `k = 3`
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 1 = 4 >= k` is false, so the output is 'YES'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

**Correctness: True**
