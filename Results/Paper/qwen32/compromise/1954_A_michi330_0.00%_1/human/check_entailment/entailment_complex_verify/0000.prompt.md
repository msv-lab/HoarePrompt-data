You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob have bought a ribbon consisting of n parts. Now they want to
paint it.

First, Alice will paint every part of the ribbon into one of m colors. For
each part, she can choose its color arbitrarily.

Then, Bob will choose at most k  parts of the ribbon and repaint them into the
same color (he chooses the affected parts and the color arbitrarily).

Bob would like all parts to have the same color. However, Alice thinks that
this is too dull, so she wants to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob
cannot make all parts have the same color.

Is it possible to paint the ribbon in such a way?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing three integers n , m and k (1
\le m, k \le n \le 50 ) — the number of parts, the number of colors and the
number of parts Bob can repaint, respectively.

Output

For each test case, print YES if Alice can paint the ribbon so that Bob cannot
make all parts have the same color. Otherwise, print NO.

You can print every letter in any register. For example, Yes, yes, yEs will
all be recognized as positive answer.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1
    
    5 1 1
    
    5 2 1
    
    5 2 2
    
    5 5 3

Output

    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first test case, a ribbon consists of 1 part. So all its parts will
always have the same color.

In the second test case, there is only 1 color.

In the third test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]
. It's impossible to change the color of at most 1 part so that all parts have
the same color.

In the fourth test case, no matter how Alice paints the ribbon, Bob will
always be able to repaint 2 parts so that all parts have the same color.

In the fifth test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
. It's impossible to change the color of at most 3 parts so that all parts
have the same color.

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('Yes')



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of parts of the ribbon, the number of colors available, and the maximum number of parts Bob can repaint, respectively.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('Yes')
        
    #State: A sequence of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, one for each test case, corresponding to the result of the condition checks inside the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. It determines for each test case whether it is possible to repaint the ribbon under the given constraints and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly determines whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Condition `n <= k`**: If the number of parts `n` is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint `k`, then Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color. Hence, the program correctly prints 'NO' in this case.

2. **Condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`**: This condition checks if the number of parts that cannot be painted uniquely by Alice (i.e., `n - math.ceil(n / m)`) is less than `k`. Here, `math.ceil(n / m)` represents the maximum number of parts that can be painted with different colors. If the remaining parts (those that would have to be painted with the same color if Alice uses all `m` colors) are fewer than `k`, Bob can repaint those parts to make all parts the same color. Thus, the program correctly prints 'NO' in this case.

3. **Otherwise**: If neither of the above conditions is met, it means Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot repaint just `k` parts to make all parts the same color. Therefore, the program correctly prints 'YES' in this case.

The program handles all edge cases as per the problem statement and the provided examples. There are no inputs that would cause the program to produce an incorrect output based on the given problem description.
