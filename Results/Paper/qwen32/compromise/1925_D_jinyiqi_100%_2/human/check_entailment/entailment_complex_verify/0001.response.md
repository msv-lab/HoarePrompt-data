### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and the provided solution to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for excursions. The expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and we need to output \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

#### Key Points:
1. **Total Possible Pairs**: For `n` children, the total number of possible pairs is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
2. **Friendship Value Increase**: When a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
3. **Expected Value Calculation**: We need to consider the probability of choosing a pair and how the friendship values evolve over `k` excursions.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads `m` lines of friend pairs with their initial friendship values.

2. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values**:
   - The program calculates the sum of all initial friendship values (`sum_f`).

3. **Total Possible Pairs**:
   - The program calculates the total number of possible pairs using the formula \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).

4. **Calculating `p` and `q`**:
   - The program calculates `p` and `q` based on the formula derived from the problem statement.
   - `p` is calculated as `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`.
   - `q` is calculated as `2 * cn2 ** 2`.

5. **Simplifying the Fraction**:
   - The program simplifies the fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

6. **Modular Inverse and Output**:
   - The program calculates the modular inverse of `q` modulo \(10^9+7\) using `pow(q, -1, M)`.
   - It then computes the result as `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)` and prints it.

#### Issues in the Program:
The main issue identified in the original assessment is the incorrect formula used for calculating `p` and `q`. Let's verify this by deriving the correct formula.

##### Derivation of Correct Formula:
1. **Probability of Choosing a Friend Pair**:
   - Probability of choosing a friend pair in any given excursion is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - Probability of choosing a non-friend pair is \(\frac{\binom{n}{2} - m}{\binom{n}{2}}\).

2. **Expected Increase in Friendship Value**:
   - For each friend pair, the expected increase in friendship value after `k` excursions can be calculated using the linearity of expectation.
   - For a friend pair with initial friendship value `f`, the expected value after `k` excursions is \(f + \text{expected number of times the pair is chosen}\).

3. **Expected Number of Times a Friend Pair is Chosen**:
   - The expected number of times a specific friend pair is chosen in `k` excursions is \(k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\).

4. **Expected Sum of Friendship Values**:
   - The expected sum of friendship values for all `k` excursions can be derived as:
     \[
     \text{Expected Sum} = \sum_{\text{all friend pairs}} \left(f + k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\right)
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     \text{Expected Sum} = \sum_{\text{all friend pairs}} f + k \times \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}
     \]

5. **Fraction Representation**:
   - The expected sum can be represented as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), where:
     \[
     p = \left(\sum_{\text{all friend pairs}} f \times \binom{n}{2}\right) + k \times m
     \]
     \[
     q = \binom{n}{2}
     \]

6. **Simplifying the Fraction**:
   - Simplify the fraction by dividing `p` and `q` by their GCD.

7. **Modular Inverse and Output**:
   - Compute the modular inverse of `q` modulo \(10^9+7\) and compute the result.

The formula used in the program does not match the derived formula, indicating an error in the implementation.

#### Conclusion:
Given the incorrect formula used for `p` and `q`, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Final: False**
