Let's carefully analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:

The problem requires us to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for excursions. This expected value needs to be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime integers, and we need to calculate \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

### Key Points:
1. **Total Possible Pairs**: For \(n\) children, the total number of possible pairs is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
2. **Friendship Values**: Each pair of friends starts with a certain friendship value and increases by 1 each time they are chosen.
3. **Expected Value Calculation**: We need to calculate the expected sum of friendship values over \(k\) excursions.

### Program Analysis:

The provided program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the number of children \(n\), the number of pairs of friends \(m\), and the number of excursions \(k\). It then reads the details of each pair of friends and their initial friendship values.

The core part of the program calculates:
- `sum_f`: The sum of initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.
- `cn2`: The total number of possible pairs of children.
- `p` and `q`: The numerator and denominator of the fraction representing the expected value.
- Finally, it computes \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

### Issues in the Program:

Upon reviewing the program, there are several issues:

1. **Incorrect Formula for `p` and `q`**:
   - The formula used for `p` and `q` seems incorrect. The current implementation does not accurately reflect the expected value calculation as described in the problem statement.
   
2. **Handling of Non-Friend Pairs**:
   - The program does not correctly account for the contribution of non-friend pairs to the expected value.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where there are no pairs of friends (\(m = 0\)) correctly.
   - It also does not handle cases where \(k\) is very large relative to \(n\) and \(m\).

### Conclusion:

Given these issues, the program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all test cases as described in the problem statement.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program fails to correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values due to incorrect formulas and lack of proper handling of edge cases. Specifically, the formula for `p` and `q` is incorrect, and the program does not account for the contribution of non-friend pairs properly.
