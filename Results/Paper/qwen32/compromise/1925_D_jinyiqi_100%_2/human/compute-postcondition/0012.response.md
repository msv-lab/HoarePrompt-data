The given code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `f`. The initial state specifies that `a`, `b`, and `f` already have values, but these values are being overwritten by the new input values.

Here's the updated state of the variables after executing the code:

- `t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.
- `i` remains 0.
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `m` remains an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `k` remains an input integer.
- `sum_f` is recalculated as 2 * `f` using the newly input value of `f`.
- `j` remains 2.
- `a`, `b`, and `f` are reassigned to the new input values.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is 2 * `f` (where `f` is the newly input value), `j` is 2, `a` is the first integer from the new input, `b` is the second integer from the new input, `f` is the third integer from the new input.**
