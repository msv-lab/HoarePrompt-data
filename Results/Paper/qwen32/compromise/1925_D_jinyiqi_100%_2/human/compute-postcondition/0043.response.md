The code snippet updates the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` by reading three integers from the input. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are dependent on `n`, `m`, or `k`. Since `n`, `m`, and `k` are reassigned, their new values will affect the subsequent calculations involving them.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `k` is the third integer from the new input, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read in the `m` iterations, `j` is `2m - 1`, `a`, `b`, `f` are the values from the last iteration, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` divided by `gcd(p, q)`, `q` is `n * (n - 1) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**
