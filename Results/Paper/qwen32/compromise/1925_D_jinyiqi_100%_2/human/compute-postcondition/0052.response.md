The given code snippet updates the values of `a`, `b`, and `f` by reading new integers from the input. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, `j`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, `gcd`) remain unchanged.

Here's the updated state:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the new input, `sum_f` is `sum_f + 2 * f`, `j` is 2, `a`, `b`, `f` are the new values from the input, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` divided by `gcd(p, q)`, `q` is `n * (n - 1) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**

Natural language explanation: The values of `a`, `b`, and `f` have been updated to the new integers read from the input. All other variables retain their previous values.
