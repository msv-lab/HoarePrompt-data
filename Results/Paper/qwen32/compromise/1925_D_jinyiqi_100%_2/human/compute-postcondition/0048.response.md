The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `m` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `m` must remain greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the new input, `sum_f` is `sum_f + f`, `j` is 1, `a`, `b`, `f` are the values from the last iteration updated to the new input values, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` divided by `gcd(p, q)`, `q` is `n * (n - 1) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`**
