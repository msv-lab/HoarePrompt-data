The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `i` also remains unchanged since they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**
