To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation involved:

### Initial State:
- `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\).
- `i`: Initialized to 1.
- `n`: The first integer from the new input.
- `m`: The second integer from the new input.
- `k`: The third integer from the new input.
- `sum_f`: The sum of all `f` values read in the `m` iterations.
- `j`: Set to \(2m - 1\).
- `a`, `b`, `f`: Values from the last iteration.
- `cn2`: Calculated as \(n \cdot (n - 1) // 2\).
- `p`: Calculated as \(\frac{2 \cdot k \cdot cn2 \cdot sum_f + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)}{\text{gcd}(p, q)}\).
- `q`: Calculated as \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{\text{gcd}}\).
- `gcd`: The greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M))
```

### Explanation:
1. **`cn2` Calculation**: 
   - `cn2` is the number of ways to choose 2 items from `n` items, which is \(\binom{n}{2}\).

2. **`p` Calculation**:
   - `p` involves a combination of `k`, `cn2`, and `sum_f`, scaled by `m` and adjusted by the greatest common divisor (`gcd`).

3. **`q` Calculation**:
   - `q` is derived from `n` and adjusted by the same `gcd`.

4. **Modular Inverse**:
   - `pow(q, -1, M)` computes the modular inverse of `q` modulo `M`. This is the value `x` such that \(q \cdot x \equiv 1 \pmod{M}\).

5. **Final Expression**:
   - The expression `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)` computes the product of `p` and the modular inverse of `q` modulo `M`, then takes the result modulo `M`.

### Output Description:
The print statement will output the result of the expression `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)`, where:
- `p` is the computed numerator adjusted by the greatest common divisor.
- `q` is the computed denominator adjusted by the greatest common divisor.
- `M` is a constant (not specified in the initial state, but typically it would be a large prime number like \(10^9 + 7\)).

Given the complexity and the dependency on specific input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `sum_f`, the exact numerical value cannot be determined without those inputs. However, the expression itself is well-defined based on the provided initial state.

### Final Output:
Output: **the result of int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M) (where p and q are computed based on the input values n, m, k, and sum_f, and M is a predefined modulus)**
