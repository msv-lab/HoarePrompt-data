To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(t):`, so the only variable we can adjust is `i`.

However, since the loop iterates over the range of `t`, the primary requirement for the loop to execute is that `t` must be greater than 0. Given that the problem states `1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4`, the loop will always execute as long as `t` is within this range.

Therefore, no specific adjustment is needed for `i` because it is automatically initialized to 0 when the loop starts. The state of `t` is already within the required range, ensuring that the loop will execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 0**
