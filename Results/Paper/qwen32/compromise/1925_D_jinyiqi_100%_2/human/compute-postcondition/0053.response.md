The code snippet provided increments the value of `sum_f` by adding the current value of `f` to it.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4
- `i` is 2
- `n` is the first integer from the new input
- `m` must be greater than 0
- `k` is the third integer from the new input
- `sum_f` is `sum_f + 2 * f`
- `j` is 2
- `a`, `b`, `f` are the new values from the input
- `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`
- `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` divided by `gcd(p, q)`
- `q` is `n * (n - 1) // gcd`
- `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`

After executing the line `sum_f += f`, the value of `sum_f` changes to `sum_f + f`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the new input, `sum_f` is `sum_f + 2 * f + f`, `j` is 2, `a`, `b`, `f` are the new values from the input, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` divided by `gcd(p, q)`, `q` is `n * (n - 1) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**

In simpler terms, `sum_f` is now `sum_f + 3 * f`. All other variables remain unchanged.
