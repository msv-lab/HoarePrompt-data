Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of an integer input, while the initial state of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remains unchanged as per the given conditions.
