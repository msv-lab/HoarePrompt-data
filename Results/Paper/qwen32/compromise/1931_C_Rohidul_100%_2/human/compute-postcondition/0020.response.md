The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Given the initial state, `r` was `n - 1`. After the decrement, `r` becomes `n - 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers where `a[n - 1] == a[n - 2]`; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is `n - 2`; `r` is `n - 2`; `st` is the length of the sequence of consecutive equal elements from the start; `end` is 2**.
