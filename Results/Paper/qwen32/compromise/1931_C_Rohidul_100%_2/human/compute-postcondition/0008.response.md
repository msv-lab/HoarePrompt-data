The code snippet `st += 1` increments the value of the variable `st` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given that the initial state specifies that `st` is 1, after the increment, `st` becomes 2. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is at least 2; `a` is a list of integers where `a[0] == a[1]`; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is 1; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 2; `end` is 1**
