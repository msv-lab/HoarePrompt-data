Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers where `a[n - 1] == a[n - 2]`; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is `n - 2`; `r` is `n - 2`; `st` is the length of the sequence of consecutive equal elements from the start; `end` is 3**

The value of `end` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables retain their initial values.
