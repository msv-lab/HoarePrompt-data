The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer greater than 1
- `a` is the new list of integers read from the input with the last two elements being equal
- `le` is the length of the list `a`
- `l` is `k-1` where `k` is the length of the sequence of equal elements starting from `a[0]`
- `r` is `n - 3`
- `st` is `k`
- `end` is 2
- `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))` if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, otherwise `le - max(st, end)`

After executing `r -= 1`, the value of `r` becomes `n - 4`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is the new list of integers read from the input with the last two elements being equal, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is `k-1` where `k` is the length of the sequence of equal elements starting from `a[0]`, `r` is `n - 4`, `st` is `k`, `end` is 2, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))` if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, otherwise `le - max(st, end)`**
