To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the `while` loop head: `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Condition: `l < r`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `l` is 2 and `r` is `n - 1`.
   - To ensure the loop can execute again, `l` must be less than `r`. Therefore, `l` should be less than `n - 1`.

2. **Condition: `a[l] == a[l + 1]`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `a[l] == a[l + 1]` must be true for the loop to execute again.
   - Given that `a[0] == a[1] == a[2]`, initially, `a[l] == a[l + 1]` is true when `l` is 2 (since `a[2] == a[3]` would need to be true for the loop to continue).
   - To ensure `a[l] == a[l + 1]` remains true, the value at index `l + 1` should be the same as the value at index `l`.

Given the constraints and the current state, we need to adjust `l` and potentially the list `a` to ensure both conditions hold true for the next iteration. However, since we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head (`l` and `r`), we should ensure `l` is such that `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]` is true.

Since `a[l] == a[l + 1]` must be true and `a[0] == a[1] == a[2]` initially, we can assume that `a[l]` and `a[l + 1]` will continue to be equal as long as we do not modify the list `a` and `l` is incremented in a way that keeps it within the bounds and maintains the equality.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted such that `l` is incremented but still satisfies `l < r`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be at least 3, `a` is a list of integers with at least three elements where `a[0] == a[1]` and `a[1] == a[2]`, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is 3, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 3, `end` is 1, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))` if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`**
