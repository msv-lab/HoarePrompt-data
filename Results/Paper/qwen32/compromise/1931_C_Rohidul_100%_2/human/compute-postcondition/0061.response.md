To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and understand the computation of `ans`.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable seems to be the number of test cases, but since we are focusing on a single execution of the code, we can ignore this for now.
2. **`n`**: An input integer representing the number of elements in the list `a`.
3. **`a`**: A list of integers of length `n`.
4. **`le`**: The length of the list `a`, which is `n`.
5. **`l`**: An index such that \(l < n - 1\) and `a[l] != a[l + 1]`. This means `l` points to the first index where two consecutive elements in the list `a` are different.
6. **`r`**: Initially set to `l`, though it's not used in the calculation of `ans` based on the given information.
7. **`st`**: The count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of the list `a`.
8. **`end`**: The count of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list `a` until the first element that is not equal to its subsequent element.
9. **`ans`**: Calculated based on the following conditions:
   - If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`.
   - Otherwise, `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`.

### Calculation of `ans`:
1. **Determine `st`**:
   - `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element.
   - For example, if `a = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]`, then `st = 2` because the first two elements are equal.

2. **Determine `end`**:
   - `end` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list until the first element that is not equal to its subsequent element.
   - For example, if `a = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]`, then `end = 1` because the last element is not equal to its preceding element.

3. **Determine `ans`**:
   - If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`:
     - `ans = max(0, le - (st + end))`
   - Otherwise:
     - `ans = le - max(st, end)`

### Example Calculation:
Let's take an example to illustrate the calculation:
- Suppose `a = [1, 1, 2, 2, 1]`.
- Here, `le = 5`, `st = 2` (since the first two elements are equal), `end = 2` (since the last two elements are equal).
- Since `a[0]` (which is 1) is equal to `a[-1]` (which is also 1), we use the first condition:
  - `ans = max(0, 5 - (2 + 2)) = max(0, 1) = 1`.

### General Output:
Given the above breakdown, the value of `ans` is computed based on the conditions specified. Without the exact values of `a`, `st`, and `end`, we can describe the output based on the conditions provided.

### Final Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is calculated as max(0, le - (st + end)) if a[0] == a[-1], otherwise le - max(st, end))**
