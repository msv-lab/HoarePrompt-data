You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, x and y are integers such that 1 <= x < 10^100 and 1 <= y < 10^100, and both x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i <= len(a) // 2 - 1:
            n = min(a[i], b[i])
            m = max(a[i], b[i])
            a[i] = m
            b[i] = n
        else:
            n = min(a[i], b[i])
            m = max(a[i], b[i])
            a[i] = n
            b[i] = m
        
    #State: the first half of `a` contains the larger characters and the first half of `b` contains the smaller characters from the corresponding positions in the original `a` and `b`; the second half of `a` contains the smaller characters and the second half of `b` contains the larger characters from the corresponding positions in the original `a` and `b`.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: the first half of `a` contains the larger characters and the first half of `b` contains the smaller characters from the corresponding positions in the original `a` and `b`; the second half of `a` contains the smaller characters and the second half of `b` contains the larger characters from the corresponding positions in the original `a` and `b`.
    print()
    #This is printed: (an empty line)
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
        
    #State: the concatenation of all elements in `b`.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a blank line)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, two integers `x` and `y` are provided. Each integer consists only of digits from 1 to 9. The function returns the result of some computation or comparison for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
