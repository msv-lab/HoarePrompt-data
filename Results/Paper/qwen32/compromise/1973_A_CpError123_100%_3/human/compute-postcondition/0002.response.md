To determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop for each test case. The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, and performs the following operations:

1. Checks if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` and continues to the next iteration.
2. If the sum is even, it calculates `x` as half of the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It then calculates `y` as the sum of `a` and `b`.
4. Finally, it prints the minimum of `x` and `y`.

Given the initial state where `t` is the number of test cases and `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` represent the scores of the three players in non-decreasing order, the output state will be a series of printed values for each test case.

Since the loop only affects the output through the `print` statements and does not modify any variables outside the loop, the output state can be described as a sequence of printed values based on the input test cases.

Output State: **A series of printed values for each test case, where each value is either `-1` (if the sum of the scores is odd) or the minimum of half the sum of the scores and the sum of the two lower scores (if the sum is even).**
