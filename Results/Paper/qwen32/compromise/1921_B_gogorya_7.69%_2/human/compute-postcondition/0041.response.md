Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `s1` is the new input string; `s2` is the next input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2` and `hd` is greater than 0; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`; `_` is incremented by 1; `hd` is `hd - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `hd` is decremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
