The code assigns the variable `res` the absolute value of the difference between `a1` and `a2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `s1`, `s2`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged. The value of `hd` is also not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s1` is an input string; `s2` is the next input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2`; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`**.
