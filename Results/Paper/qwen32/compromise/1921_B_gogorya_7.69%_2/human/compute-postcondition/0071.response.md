The value of `hd` is decremented by 1. Given that the initial value of `hd` is greater than 0, after the operation `hd -= 1`, `hd` will still be a non-negative integer. The values of `t`, `n`, `s1`, `s2`, `a1`, `a2`, `res`, and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 1, `s1` is the newly input string, `s2` is the next input string, `a1` is the count of '1's in the newly input `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in the newly input `s2`, `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 1`, `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`, `_` is `n + 1`.**
