To determine the output of the `print(res)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable is not directly used in the print statement.
2. **n**: A new input integer. This variable is not directly used in the print statement, but it is assigned to the variable `_` (which is a common practice to ignore a value).
3. **s1**: A new input string.
4. **s2**: The next input string.
5. **a1**: The count of '1's in the string `s1`.
6. **a2**: The count of '1's in the string `s2`.
7. **hd**: Initialized to 0. This variable is not used in the print statement.
8. **res**: Calculated as \( \text{abs}(a1 - a2) + \text{count\_10} \). Here, `count_10` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, which indicates that it might be a variable or a value that needs to be determined from the context or might be zero if not provided.

### Calculating `res`:
- **abs(a1 - a2)**: This is the absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and `s2`.
- **count_10**: This variable is not mentioned in the initial state, and since it's not provided, we assume it to be 0 based on the typical context of such problems where undefined variables default to 0 unless specified otherwise.

### Final Calculation:
- **res = abs(a1 - a2) + count_10**:
  - If `count_10` is 0, then `res` simplifies to `abs(a1 - a2)`.

### Conclusion:
The value of `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`.

### Output:
Output: **abs(a1 - a2) (where a1 is the count of '1's in s1 and a2 is the count of '1's in s2)**
