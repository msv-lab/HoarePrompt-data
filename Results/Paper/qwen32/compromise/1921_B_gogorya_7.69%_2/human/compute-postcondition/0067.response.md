Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the newly input integer; `s1` is the newly input string; `s2` is the next input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in the newly input `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in the newly input `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2`; `res` is abs(a1 - a2) + count_10; `_` is `n + 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `hd` has been updated to be the difference between `a1` and `a2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
