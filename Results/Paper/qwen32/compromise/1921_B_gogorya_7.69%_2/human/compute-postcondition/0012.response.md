The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the variables or the values in any way; it merely controls the flow of the loop. Since there is no loop explicitly shown in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement here does not have any impact on the variables or the logic.

Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged after the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `s1` is an input string; `s2` is the next input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2` and `hd` is greater than 0; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)` which is equal to `hd`; `hd` is decreased by 1.**
