Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s1` is an input string; `s2` is the next input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2`.**

In simple terms, the variable `hd` is now assigned the value of the difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and the count of '1's in `s2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
