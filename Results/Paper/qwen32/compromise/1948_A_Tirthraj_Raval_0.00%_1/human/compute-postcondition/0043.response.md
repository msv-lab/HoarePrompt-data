The code snippet appends either 'A' or 'B' to the `pattern` list based on the value of `i % 2`. Since the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, we can only determine that `pattern` will have one additional element, which will be either 'A' or 'B'. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `n` still must be at least 2, while `t` is still within the range 0 to 48.

Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 0 to 48, `n` must be at least 2, `pattern` is a list containing one additional element which is either 'A' or 'B'.**
