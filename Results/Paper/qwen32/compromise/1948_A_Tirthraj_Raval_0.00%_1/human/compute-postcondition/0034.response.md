To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop runs for `n // 2` iterations, where `n` is the input integer. In each iteration, the loop appends two characters to the `pattern` list: 'A' or 'B' based on the parity of `i`.

Here's a breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. The loop runs `n // 2` times.
2. In each iteration, it appends 'A' or 'B' based on `i % 2`.
3. It then appends the opposite character ('B' if `i % 2` is 0, 'A' if `i % 2` is 1).

Let's analyze the pattern:
- When `i` is 0, it appends 'A' and then 'B'.
- When `i` is 1, it appends 'B' and then 'A'.
- When `i` is 2, it appends 'A' and then 'B'.
- And so on...

This means the `pattern` list will alternate between 'A' and 'B' for the first half of `n` characters, with the sequence 'AB' repeating `n // 2` times.

Given this behavior, after all iterations are complete, the `pattern` list will have `n // 2` pairs of 'AB'.

The value of `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop as it is not modified in the loop body.

Let's formalize the final output state:

- `t` remains the same integer within the range 0 to 49.
- `n` remains the input integer.
- `pattern` is a list containing `n // 2` pairs of 'AB'.

Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 0 to 49, `n` is an input integer, `pattern` is a list containing `n // 2` pairs of 'AB'.**

In natural language: The final state is that `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains the same input integer, and `pattern` contains `n // 2` pairs of 'AB'.
