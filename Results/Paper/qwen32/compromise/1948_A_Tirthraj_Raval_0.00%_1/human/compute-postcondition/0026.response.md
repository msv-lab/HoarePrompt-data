The code appends a character to the `pattern` list based on the value of `i % 2`. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we can only determine that the appended character will be either 'A' or 'B'. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 0 to 49, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `pattern` is a list containing either 'A' or 'B'**.
