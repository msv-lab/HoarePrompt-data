The code appends either 'A' or 'B' to the `pattern` list based on the value of `i % 2`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 before this line, the exact value of `i` is not specified, but we know it affects whether 'A' or 'B' is appended. The value of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 0 to 49, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `pattern` has an additional element which is either 'A' or 'B' depending on the parity of the new `i`.**
