### Reasoning:
The problem requires us to construct a string with exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The provided program addresses this task by checking if `n` is even. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where special characters are defined as being equal to exactly one of their neighbors (since each special character would need a non-special neighbor on one side and a special neighbor on the other, leading to an even count).

For even `n`, the program constructs a string by alternating between 'A' and 'B'. Specifically, it creates pairs of 'AB' and 'BA', ensuring that each 'A' and 'B' in the pair has exactly one neighbor that is the same and one that is different, thus making them special characters. The pattern 'ABABAB...' or 'BABA...' will have exactly `n` special characters if `n` is even.

Let's break down the execution for the example provided:
- For `n = 6`, the program will generate a pattern like 'ABABAB', which indeed has 6 special characters.
- For `n = 1`, the program correctly outputs "NO" because it's impossible to have a single special character in a string.
- For `n = 2`, the program will generate a pattern like 'AB' or 'BA', which has exactly 2 special characters.

Given these observations, the program correctly handles the requirements of the problem.
