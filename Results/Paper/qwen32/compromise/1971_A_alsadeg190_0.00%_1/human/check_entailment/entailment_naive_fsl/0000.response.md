Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly output the minimum and maximum of the two integers for each test case. Instead, it prints the larger number first, followed by the smaller number, which is the opposite of what is required by the problem description.

For example, given the input `1 9`, the program outputs `9 1` instead of `1 9`. This is incorrect according to the problem description, which specifies that the output should be the minimum followed by the maximum of the two integers. 

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(min(x, y), max(x, y))

```

This corrected version will ensure that for each test case, the minimum of x and y is printed first, followed by the maximum of x and y.
