Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`. `n` represents the number of moves Nikita can make, and `m` represents the desired number of cubes in the tower. For each test case, the function determines if it is possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes using `n` moves. If it is possible, the function returns "Yes"; otherwise, it returns "No".**
