Let's carefully analyze the program and the original assessment using the provided annotations and the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move.
- The goal is to determine if after `n` moves, the tower can have exactly `m` cubes.
- For each test case, output "Yes" if it's possible, otherwise "No".

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)  # This line does not affect the logic
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Annotations Recap:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `a` is the number of test cases.
2. **Loop through each test case**:
   - `b` is the number of moves.
   - `c` is the desired number of cubes.
   - `q = (b, c)` is a tuple that does not affect the logic.
3. **Logic**:
   - **Case 1: `b == c`**
     - If `b` equals `c`, it prints 'YES'.
   - **Case 2: `b < c`**
     - If `b` is less than `c`, it prints 'NO'.
   - **Case 3: `b % 2 == c % 2`**
     - If `b` and `c` have the same parity, it prints 'Yes'.
   - **Case 4: `else`**
     - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'No'.

### Original Assessment Recap:
- **Case 1**: Correct, if `b == c`, it's possible to end up with `m` cubes.
- **Case 2**: Correct, if `b < c`, it's impossible to end up with `m` cubes.
- **Case 3**: Correct, if `b` and `c` have the same parity, it's possible to end up with `m` cubes.
- **Case 4**: Correct, if `b` and `c` have different parities, it's impossible to end up with `m` cubes.

### Detailed Reasoning:
- **Case 1 (`b == c`)**: This is straightforward. If the number of moves equals the number of cubes, Nikita can simply add one cube per move. The program correctly prints 'YES'.
- **Case 2 (`b < c`)**: This is also straightforward. If the number of moves is less than the number of cubes, it's impossible to have more cubes than moves. The program correctly prints 'NO'.
- **Case 3 (`b % 2 == c % 2`)**: This is where the logic gets a bit tricky. If `b` and `c` have the same parity, it's possible to end up with `m` cubes. This is because:
  - If both `b` and `c` are even, Nikita can alternate adding and removing cubes to eventually reach `m`.
  - If both `b` and `c` are odd, Nikita can end up with `m` cubes after an odd number of operations.
  - The program correctly prints 'Yes' in this case.
- **Case 4 (`else`)**: If `b` and `c` have different parities, it's impossible to end up with `m` cubes because an odd number of operations cannot result in an even number of cubes and vice versa. The program correctly prints 'No'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all possible cases as per the problem description. It checks if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, if the number of moves is less than the number of cubes, and if the parities of the number of moves and the number of cubes match.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is correct.

**Final: True**
