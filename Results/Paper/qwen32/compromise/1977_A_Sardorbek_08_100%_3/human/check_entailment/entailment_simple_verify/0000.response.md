Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to ensure the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Recap:
Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move. The goal is to determine if after `n` moves, the tower can have exactly `m` cubes. The possible outcomes are:
1. If `n == m`, it is always possible to achieve `m` cubes by adding one cube per move.
2. If `n < m`, it is impossible to achieve `m` cubes because there aren't enough moves.
3. If `n >= m`, it is possible to achieve `m` cubes if `n` and `m` have the same parity (both even or both odd). This is because:
   - If `n` is even, we can make pairs of add and remove operations to achieve the desired number of cubes.
   - If `n` is odd, we can still achieve the desired number of cubes if `m` is also odd, because we can start with an odd number of cubes and adjust by adding or removing cubes in pairs.

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)  # This line does not affect the logic
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

#### Logic Analysis:
1. **Case 1: `b == c`**
   - If `b` (number of moves) equals `c` (desired number of cubes), the answer is "YES".
   - This is correct because if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, Nikita can simply add one cube per move.

2. **Case 2: `b < c`**
   - If the number of moves is less than the number of cubes, the answer is "NO".
   - This is correct because it's impossible to have more cubes than moves if each move can only add or remove one cube.

3. **Case 3: `b % 2 == c % 2`**
   - If the number of moves and the number of cubes have the same parity (both even or both odd), the answer is "Yes".
   - This is correct because:
     - If `b` is even, `c` can be achieved by alternating add and remove operations.
     - If `b` is odd, `c` can be achieved if it is possible to end up with the desired number of cubes after an odd number of operations.

4. **Case 4: `else`**
   - If the above conditions are not met, the answer is "No".
   - This is correct because if `b` is even and `c` is odd (or vice versa), it's impossible to end up with `c` cubes after `b` moves.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all possible cases as per the problem description. It checks if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, if the number of moves is less than the number of cubes, and if the parities of the number of moves and the number of cubes match.

### Validation Using Annotations:
The annotations confirm the program's behavior at key points:
- The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case correctly.
- The conditions `b == c`, `b < c`, and `b % 2 == c % 2` are checked in the correct order.
- The output for each test case is consistent with the logic described above.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly determines the possibility of achieving `m` cubes after `n` moves by considering the parity of `n` and `m` and the condition where `n` is less than `m`.

**Final: True**
