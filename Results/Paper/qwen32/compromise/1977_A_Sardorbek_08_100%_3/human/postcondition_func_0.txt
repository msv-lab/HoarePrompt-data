The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`. It determines if it is possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes using `n` moves and prints "YES", "NO", "Yes", or "No" based on the conditions specified. The input parameters `n` and `m` remain unchanged after processing each test case.
