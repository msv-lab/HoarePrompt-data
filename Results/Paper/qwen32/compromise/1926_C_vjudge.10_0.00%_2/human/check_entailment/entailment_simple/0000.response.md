### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem by iterating through each test case, then for each number from 1 to n in that test case, it calculates the sum of its digits using the `func_1` function and accumulates this sum in the `soma` variable. However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. **Initialization of `soma`**: The `soma` variable is initialized outside the loop that handles each test case. This means that the sum from previous test cases will carry over to the next test case, leading to incorrect results.

2. **Range in the inner loop**: The inner loop iterates from 0 to `n-1` (since `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`). The problem statement specifies that the numbers written on the board are from 1 to `n`, inclusive. Therefore, the loop should iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

3. **Output**: The program prints the final accumulated sum `soma` after all test cases have been processed. However, the problem requires the sum for each test case to be printed separately.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as it stands.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
