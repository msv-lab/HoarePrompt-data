To determine the final output state after all the iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables change with each iteration.

The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1` (since `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`). During each iteration, the loop checks if the current index `i` is a key in the `mpp` dictionary (which counts the frequency of elements in `arr`). If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop. If `i` is a key and its frequency is 1 and `first` is True, it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop. If `i` is a key and its frequency is 1 and `first` is False, it sets `first` to True.

Given the initial state and the behavior described, let's analyze the possible outcomes:

1. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()` at any point, the loop will break and print `i`.
2. If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is True, the loop will break and print `i`.
3. If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is False, it will set `first` to True.
4. If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i] > 1`, nothing changes except `i` is incremented.

The loop will continue until one of the break conditions is met or `i` reaches `n`. 

Since we are asked to determine the output state after all iterations, we need to consider the scenario where the loop runs to completion without breaking. This means that for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, either `i` is not in `mpp.keys()` (which would have caused a break), or `i` is in `mpp.keys()` with a frequency greater than 1 (which does not cause a break), or `i` is in `mpp.keys()` with a frequency of 1 but `first` is not yet True (which sets `first` to True but does not cause a break).

If the loop runs to completion, it means no value of `i` from 0 to `n-1` caused the loop to break. This implies that either:
- All `i` from 0 to `n-1` are not in `mpp.keys()`, or
- All `i` from 0 to `n-1` are in `mpp.keys()` but do not meet the break conditions (i.e., they either have a frequency greater than 1 or are the first `i` with a frequency of 1).

In this case, the final state of the variables will be:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `arr` remains unchanged.
- `mpp` remains unchanged.
- `first` will be True if there was at least one `i` with a frequency of 1, otherwise it will remain False.
- `i` will be equal to `n` (since the loop runs from 0 to `n-1`).

Therefore, the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is a boolean that is True if there was at least one `i` with a frequency of 1, otherwise it remains False; `i` is equal to `n`.**

In simpler terms, the loop completes all iterations without breaking, and `first` is True if there was at least one unique element in the range from 0 to `n-1` in `arr`, otherwise `first` remains False. The value of `i` will be `n` at the end of the loop.
