Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is a boolean; `i` is an integer. If `first` is True and `i` is a key in `mpp` with a frequency of 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking out of the loop or if statement.**
