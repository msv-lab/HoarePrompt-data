To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the role of the variable `i`.

1. **Initial State Details:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 - 1.
   - `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0.
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from new input.
   - `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`.
   - `first` is a boolean variable set to `True`.
   - `i` is a key in `mpp` with a frequency of 1.

2. **Understanding the Role of `i`:**
   - `i` is specifically defined as a key in the `Counter` object `mpp` that has a frequency of 1. This means that `i` is an element in the list `arr` that appears exactly once.

3. **Determining the Output:**
   - The `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i`, which is an element from the list `arr` that appears exactly once.

Since the exact values of `arr` and thus `i` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the properties of `i`.

Output: **i (where i is an element in the list `arr` that appears exactly once)**
