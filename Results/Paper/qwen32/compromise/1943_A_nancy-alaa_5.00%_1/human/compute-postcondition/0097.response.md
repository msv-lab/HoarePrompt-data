Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input; `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the current `arr`; `first` is a boolean value; `i` is incremented by 1. If `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is True, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the loop or if statement continues.**
