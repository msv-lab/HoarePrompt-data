Let's analyze the given problem and the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to find the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it.

### Key Observations

1. **MEX Definition**: The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
2. **Optimal Play**:
   - Alice will try to add elements to `c` that will increase the MEX as much as possible.
   - Bob will try to prevent Alice from increasing the MEX by removing elements that Alice would otherwise add.

### Strategy

- Alice will add elements in such a way that the MEX is maximized. If there are multiple elements with the same count, she will choose the one that will help in increasing the MEX.
- Bob will remove elements that would help Alice in increasing the MEX.

### Correctness Analysis

To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's examine the logic:

1. **Counting Elements**: The program uses `Counter` to count occurrences of each element in the array `arr`.
2. **Iterating Over Possible Values**: It iterates over possible values from `0` to `n-1` to find the MEX.
3. **Checking Conditions**:
   - If a value `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, it means `i` is not present in the array, so it prints `i` and breaks.
   - If a value `i` is present exactly once and `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks.
   - If a value `i` is present exactly once, it sets `first` to `True`.

### Issues in the Program

The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players. Here are the issues:

1. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**: The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. It simply checks the counts and prints the MEX without considering the game dynamics.
2. **Incorrect Logic for MEX Calculation**: The program does not correctly determine the MEX based on the optimal play by Alice and Bob. It only checks for the presence of elements and their counts, which does not account for the strategic removal of elements by Bob.

### Correct Approach

A correct approach would involve:
- Simulating the turns of Alice and Bob.
- Keeping track of the elements added to `c` and removed from `a`.
- Dynamically calculating the MEX based on the current state of `c`.

### Conclusion

Given the issues in the provided program, it does not correctly determine the game's final score if both players play optimally.

**Correctness: False**
