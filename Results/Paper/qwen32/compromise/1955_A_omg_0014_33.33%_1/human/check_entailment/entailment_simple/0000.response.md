Reasoning:  
The provided program contains several logical errors that prevent it from correctly calculating the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Input Parsing**: The program reads `n` as the number of test cases but then incorrectly reads `a`, `b`, and `c` in the loop. The correct input format is that the first line contains `t` (number of test cases), and each of the next `t` lines contains `n`, `a`, and `b`. The variable `c` does not exist in the problem description; it seems to be a typo for `b`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program calculates `d = c / 2`, which is incorrect. It seems like the intention was to compare the cost of buying yogurts individually versus in pairs. The correct calculation should involve the number of pairs (`n // 2`) and the number of single yogurts (`n % 2`).

3. **Incorrect Comparison**: The comparison `if a * b < a * d` is incorrect for several reasons:
   - `b` is the price for two yogurts, not one.
   - `d` is incorrectly calculated and used.
   - The correct comparison should be between the cost of buying `n` yogurts individually (`n * a`) and the cost of buying as many pairs as possible plus any remaining single yogurt (`(n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a`).

4. **Output**: The output logic is incorrect due to the incorrect calculations and comparisons described above.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the cost of buying as many pairs as possible and any remaining single yogurt
        cost = (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a
        
        print(cost)

#State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer, where 1 <= `n` <= 100; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 30.
```

Correctness: **False**
