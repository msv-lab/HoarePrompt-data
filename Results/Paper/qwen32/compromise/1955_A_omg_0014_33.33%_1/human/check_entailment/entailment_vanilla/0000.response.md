Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Understanding:
1. **Inputs:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy.
     - `a`: Price for one yogurt.
     - `b`: Price for two yogurts on promotion.

2. **Outputs:**
   - For each test case, print the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts.

### Logic:
- The goal is to minimize the cost of buying `n` yogurts.
- We have two options for buying yogurts:
  - Buy single yogurts at price `a`.
  - Buy pairs of yogurts at the promotion price `b`.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n` correctly.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, according to the problem, these should be `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. The variable `c` is incorrectly used as `b` in the problem description.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cost Calculation:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the cost per yogurt for the promotion (`d = c / 2`). This is incorrect because `c` should be `b`.
   - The comparison `if a * b < a * d` is incorrect for the following reasons:
     - `a * b` is not a valid cost calculation in this context.
     - `a * d` is not a valid cost calculation either.
   - The correct approach should involve:
     - Calculating how many pairs of yogurts can be bought (`n // 2`).
     - Calculating the cost for these pairs (`pairs * b`).
     - Calculating the cost for any remaining single yogurt (`(n % 2) * a`).
     - Summing these values to get the total minimum cost.

### Correct Implementation:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        pairs = n // 2
        remaining = n % 2
        total_cost = pairs * b + remaining * a
        print(total_cost)

# Example usage
# func()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts. The variables are misused, and the cost calculations are incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
