Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We have an array `a` of integers.
- We can split any number in the array that is at least 10 into its individual digits.
- We need to determine if it's possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order using the above operation.

### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function `func_1()` is called for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, the array `a` is read and converted into a list of integers.
   - The program then iterates through the array `a` and performs operations based on the value of each element.

3. **Splitting Numbers:**
   - If an element is greater than 10, it attempts to split it into its digits.
   - The logic for splitting is somewhat flawed:
     - It checks if the first digit `y` is greater than or equal to the last element in the result list `c` (which is not necessarily the correct element to compare with).
     - It then checks if the first digit `y` is less than or equal to the second digit `x` and appends them accordingly.
     - If the above conditions are not met, it appends the original number.

4. **Sorting Check:**
   - After processing the array, it checks if the resulting list `c` is sorted.
   - If `c` is sorted, it appends `1` to the list `b`; otherwise, it appends `0`.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints 'YES' for each test case where `b[i]` is `1` and 'NO' otherwise.

### Issues in the Program:
- The logic for splitting numbers and comparing them is incorrect. The program does not correctly handle the insertion of digits into the list `c`.
- The comparison logic inside the loop is flawed and does not ensure that the resulting list `c` is the correct transformation of the array `a` that could potentially be sorted.
- The program does not handle all edge cases, such as when the array is already sorted or when the array contains numbers that need to be split in a specific way to achieve a sorted order.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted using the described operation. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
