You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description for all potential cases. Here are a few issues and a counterexample to demonstrate why the program is incorrect:

1. **Logic Error in Splitting Numbers:**
   - The program attempts to split numbers greater than 10 into their digits. However, it does not correctly handle the insertion of these digits back into the array at the same position.
   - For example, if the array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program should transform it into `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` to check if it can be sorted. However, the current implementation incorrectly appends the digits to the end of the array `c` without maintaining the original order.

2. **Comparison with Previous Element:**
   - The program checks if the digits of a number can be inserted based on the comparison with the previous element in the array `c`. This logic is flawed because it does not consider the correct position for the digits and can lead to incorrect conclusions about the possibility of sorting the array.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the array is already sorted or when the numbers are less than 10 correctly. It should be able to handle these cases without modification.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the input:
```
1
3
12 28 5
```
The program should output `NO` because there is no way to split the numbers to make the array sorted. However, the current implementation might incorrectly output `YES` due to the flawed logic.

### Corrected Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Recursively split numbers greater than 10 into their digits.
2. Check if the resulting array can be sorted by comparing adjacent elements after all possible splits.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(arr):
    new_arr = []
    for num in arr:
        if num >= 10:
            new_arr.extend([int(digit) for digit in str(num)])
        else:
            new_arr.append(num)
    return new_arr == sorted(new_arr)

m = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(m):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_be_sorted(a):
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected version ensures that all numbers greater than 10 are split into their digits, and then checks if the resulting array can be sorted.
