Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for transforming the array into a non-decreasing order using the allowed operations. The logic for splitting numbers and checking if the array can be sorted is flawed. Specifically, the program does not ensure that after splitting numbers, the resulting array can be rearranged to be non-decreasing. Here is a more detailed explanation of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Splitting Logic**: The program splits numbers greater than 10 and appends the digits to a new list `c`. However, it does not handle the order correctly. For example, if a number like 28 is split into 2 and 8, the program assumes that 2 should come before 8, but it does not consider the context of the entire array.

2. **Checking Sorted Order**: The program checks if the list `c` is sorted after splitting, but this is not sufficient. The list `c` is only a temporary list used during the splitting process and does not reflect the actual transformation of the array.

3. **Handling of Initial Sorted Arrays**: The program does not correctly handle cases where the initial array is already sorted or can be made sorted by splitting numbers in a way that maintains the order.

4. **General Logic Flaw**: The program does not attempt to simulate the transformation process in a way that considers all possible splits and their effects on the order of the array.

To correctly solve the problem, a more comprehensive approach is needed, such as recursively splitting numbers and checking if the resulting array can be sorted. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(a):
    def split_and_check(arr):
        new_arr = []
        for num in arr:
            if num < 10:
                new_arr.append(num)
            else:
                new_arr.extend([int(d) for d in str(num)])
        return new_arr

    def is_sorted(arr):
        return all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))

    queue = [a]
    visited = set()
    visited.add(tuple(a))
    
    while queue:
        current = queue.pop(0)
        if is_sorted(current):
            return True
        for i in range(len(current)):
            if current[i] >= 10:
                new_arr = current[:i] + [int(d) for d in str(current[i])] + current[i+1:]
                if tuple(new_arr) not in visited:
                    visited.add(tuple(new_arr))
                    queue.append(new_arr)
    return False

m = int(input())
for _ in range(m):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_be_sorted(a):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

This corrected version uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible transformations of the array by splitting numbers and checks if any of these transformations result in a sorted array.
