You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
m = int(input())
b = []
for i in range(m):
    func_1()
for i in range(m):
    if b[i] == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

def func_1():
    k = int(input())
    a = input()
    a = list(map(int, a.split()))
    x = 0
    y = 0
    n = 0
    c = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y >= c[n - 1]:
                if y <= x:
                    c.append(y)
                    c.append(x)
                    n = n + 2
                else:
                    c.append(a[i])
                    n = n + 1
        elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    d = sorted(c)
    if c == d:
        b.append(1)
    else:
        b.append(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `k` and a list of integers `a`. It processes the list `a` by potentially splitting numbers greater than 10 into their tens and units digits, appending them to a new list `c` based on certain conditions. The function then checks if the list `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, it appends `1` to a list `b`; otherwise, it appends `0`. The function does not explicitly return any value, but it modifies the list `b` as a side effect.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
- We are given an integer array `a` of length `n`.
- We can perform an operation to split any element greater than or equal to 10 into its digits, inserting the digits in the same position.
- The goal is to determine if it's possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order using this operation any number of times.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `k` and the array `a` itself.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program processes each test case in the `func_1` function.
   - It iterates through the array `a` and checks if an element is greater than 10.
   - If an element is greater than 10, it attempts to split it into its digits.
   - The digits are then inserted into a new list `c` based on some conditions.

3. **Sorting Check:**
   - After processing the array, the program checks if the new list `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If `c` is sorted, it appends `1` to the list `b`; otherwise, it appends `0`.
   
4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints "YES" if the corresponding value in `b` is `1` and "NO" otherwise.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Splitting Logic:**
  - The logic for splitting elements and inserting digits into `c` is flawed.
  - The program does not always correctly handle the insertion of digits and the conditions for sorting.
  
- **Handling of Initial Elements:**
  - The program does not correctly handle the first element of the array when it is greater than 10.
  
- **Sorting Check:**
  - The program checks if the list `c` is sorted after processing, but it does not account for the possibility of further splits that could lead to a sorted array.
  
### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly determine if it is possible to sort the array using the described operation. It fails to handle some edge cases and does not ensure that the array can be sorted through multiple splits.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
