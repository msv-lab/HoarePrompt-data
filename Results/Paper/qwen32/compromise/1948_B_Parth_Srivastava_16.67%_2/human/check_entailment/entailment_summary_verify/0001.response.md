Let's analyze the given program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
- We are given an integer array `a` of length `n`.
- We can perform an operation to split any element greater than or equal to 10 into its digits, inserting the digits in the same position.
- The goal is to determine if it's possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order using this operation any number of times.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `k` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program processes each test case in the `func_1` function.
   - It iterates through the array `a` and checks if an element is greater than 10.
   - If an element is greater than 10, it attempts to split it into its digits.
   - The digits are then inserted into a new list `c` based on some conditions.

3. **Sorting Check:**
   - After processing the array, the program checks if the new list `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If `c` is sorted, it appends `1` to the list `b`; otherwise, it appends `0`.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints "YES" if the corresponding value in `b` is `1` and "NO" otherwise.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Splitting Logic:**
  - The logic for splitting elements and inserting digits into `c` is flawed. The program only checks if the tens digit is greater than or equal to the last element in `c` and the units digit is less than or equal to the tens digit. This is not a sufficient condition to determine if the array can be sorted.
  - For example, consider the array `[21, 13]`. The program will split `21` into `2` and `1`, but it will not correctly handle the insertion because `1` is not greater than or equal to the last element in `c` (which is `2` after inserting `2`).

- **Handling of Initial Elements:**
  - The program does not correctly handle the first element of the array when it is greater than 10. It should consider the possibility of splitting the first element and inserting the digits correctly.

- **Sorting Check:**
  - The program checks if the list `c` is sorted after processing, but it does not account for the possibility of further splits that could lead to a sorted array. The program should recursively attempt to split elements and check if a sorted array can be achieved.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly determine if it is possible to sort the array using the described operation. It fails to handle some edge cases and does not ensure that the array can be sorted through multiple splits.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the program. The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted through the described operation.

Final: **False**
