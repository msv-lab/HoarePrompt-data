The code snippet provided appends the integer `0` to the list `b`. However, `b` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we can infer that `b` must have been defined elsewhere in the code and is a list. Given the information provided, we can only describe the change to `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` is 7; `a` is a list of integers derived from the string input by the user; `k` is an input integer; `x` is 7; `y` is 6; `c` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]; `d` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]; `c` is not equal to `d`; `b` is a list with an additional element `0` appended to it.**
