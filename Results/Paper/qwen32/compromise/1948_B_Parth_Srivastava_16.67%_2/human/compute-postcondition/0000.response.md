The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `k`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `k` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99; `k` is an input integer.**
