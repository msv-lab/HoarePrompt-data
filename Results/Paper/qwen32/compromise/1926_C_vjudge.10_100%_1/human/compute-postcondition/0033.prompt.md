Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases; `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 elements, all initialized to 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, inf):
    sum_value_digits = 0
    for x in str(i):
        sum_value_digits += int(x)
    values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 elements where `values[i]` is `sum_value_digits` and all other elements are 0, `i` is `t + 1`, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `t`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains unchanged, `inf` remains 200,001, `values[i]` is the sum of the digits of `i`, `i` remains `t + 2`, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of the digits of `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` remains unchanged, `inf` remains 200,001, `i` is `t + 3`, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of all digits in `str(i)`, `values[i]` is `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
