The code snippet provided only assigns a value to the variable `inf` and does not perform any operations that affect the input variables `t` or `n`. The variable `inf` is set to `2 * 10 ** 5 + 1`, which is `200001`.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next `t` lines contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5) which is the largest number Vladislav writes on the board; `inf` is 200001.**
