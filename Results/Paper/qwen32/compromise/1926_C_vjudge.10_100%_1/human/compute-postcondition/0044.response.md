Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each of the next `t` lines, it receives an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), which is the largest number Vladislav writes on the board. The function processes each `n` and returns a result for each test case.**
