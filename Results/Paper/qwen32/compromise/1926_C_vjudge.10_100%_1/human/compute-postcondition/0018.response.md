The code snippet provided is `sum_value_digits += int(x)`. This line increments the variable `sum_value_digits` by the integer value of `x`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4)
- `inf` is 200001
- `values` is a list of 200001 elements where `values[i]` is `sum_value_digits` and all other elements are 0
- `i` is `t + 2`
- `sum_value_digits` is `sum_value_digits + int(x)`
- `x` is the next character in the string representation of `i`

The variable `x` is the next character in the string representation of `i`. Since `i` is `t + 2`, `x` will be a digit from the string representation of that number. The value of `sum_value_digits` is then incremented by the integer value of `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 elements where `values[i]` is `sum_value_digits` and all other elements are 0, `i` is `t + 2`, `sum_value_digits` is increased by the integer value of `x`, `x` is the next character in the string representation of `i`.**

In simpler terms, `sum_value_digits` has been increased by the integer value of the next digit in the string representation of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
