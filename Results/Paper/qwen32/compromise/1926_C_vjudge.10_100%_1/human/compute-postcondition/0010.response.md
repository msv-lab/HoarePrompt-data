The code snippet provided increases the value of `sum_value_digits` by the integer value of `x`. The other variables (`t`, `inf`, `values`, and `i`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Given that `sum_value_digits` was previously increased by `int(x)`, this implies that `sum_value_digits` is being continuously updated by the integer value of `x` each time this line of code is executed. However, since the initial value of `sum_value_digits` is not specified, we will denote its new value as `sum_value_digits + int(x)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 elements, all initialized to 0, `i` is 10, `sum_value_digits` is increased by `int(x)`**. This means `sum_value_digits` has been updated to its previous value plus the integer value of `x`.
