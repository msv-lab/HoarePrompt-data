The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a conventional throwaway variable) and `t` (the number of iterations). Since `_` is not used in the loop body, we only need to adjust `t` for the loop to execute one more time. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that `t` ≥ 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

Here is the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` ≥ 0, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 elements where `values[i]` is the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i` for 1 ≤ `i` ≤ 200000, `i` is 200001, `value` is an input integer**. 

However, since `t` must be decremented, the correct state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` ≥ 0 and `t` is decremented by 1 from its previous value, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 elements where `values[i]` is the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i` for 1 ≤ `i` ≤ 200000, `i` is 200001, `value` is an input integer**.

To make it more precise, if `t` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `k-1` at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`t` is `k-1` where `k` is the value of `t` at the end of the previous iteration, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 elements where `values[i]` is the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i` for 1 ≤ `i` ≤ 200000, `i` is 200001, `value` is an input integer**.

Given that `t` was initially `k` and has been decremented by 1, we can simply state:

State: **`t` is `t-1`, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 elements where `values[i]` is the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i` for 1 ≤ `i` ≤ 200000, `i` is 200001, `value` is an input integer**.
