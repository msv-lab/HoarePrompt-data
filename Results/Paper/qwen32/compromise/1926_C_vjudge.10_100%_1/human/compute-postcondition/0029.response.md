The only variables in the loop head are `x` and `i`. Since `i` is used to generate the string that `x` iterates over, we need to adjust `i` and `x` for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `inf` remains 200,001.
- `i` is `t + 3`.
- `sum_value_digits` is `sum_value_digits + int(x)`.
- `x` is the next character in `str(i)`.

For the next iteration of the loop, `x` should be the next character in the string representation of `i`. If `x` was the last character of `str(i)` in the previous iteration, then the loop should not execute again. Otherwise, `x` should be updated to the next character in `str(i)`.

Since the problem does not specify that `x` was the last character in the previous iteration, we assume that there are more characters in `str(i)` to iterate over. Therefore, `x` should be updated to the next character in `str(i)`.

However, since `i` does not change within the loop (it is only set at the start of the loop based on `t`), we do not need to adjust `i`. We only need to adjust `x` to the next character in `str(i)`.

State: **`t` remains unchanged, `inf` remains 200,001, `i` is `t + 3`, `sum_value_digits` is `sum_value_digits + int(x)`, `x` is the next character in `str(i)`**.

To be more specific, if `x` was the k-th character of `str(i)` in the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `x` should be the (k+1)-th character of `str(i)`.

State: **`t` remains unchanged, `inf` remains 200,001, `i` is `t + 3`, `sum_value_digits` is `sum_value_digits + int(x)`, `x` is the next character in `str(i)`**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `t` or the exact position of `x` in `str(i)`, we can't provide a more concrete value for `x`. But we know it should be the next character in `str(i)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` remains unchanged, `inf` remains 200,001, `i` is `t + 3`, `sum_value_digits` is `sum_value_digits + int(x)`, `x` is the next character in `str(i)`**.
