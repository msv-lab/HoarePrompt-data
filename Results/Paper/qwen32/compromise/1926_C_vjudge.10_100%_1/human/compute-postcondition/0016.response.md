Given the initial state and the code snippet, the variable `sum_value_digits` is incremented by the integer value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 elements where `values[i]` is `sum_value_digits` and all other elements are 0, `i` is `t + 2`, `sum_value_digits` is `sum_value_digits + int(x)`**

In natural language: The value of `sum_value_digits` is now increased by the integer value of `x`. All other variables retain their initial values.
