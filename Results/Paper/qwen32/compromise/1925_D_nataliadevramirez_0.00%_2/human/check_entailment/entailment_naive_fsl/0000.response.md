Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description:

### Problem Description:
The task involves calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for excursions. The friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time it is chosen. The final expected value is expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime integers, and we need to output \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`: This function calculates the result for a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads multiple test cases and applies `func_1` to each test case.

Let's break down `func_1`:
- `result = 0`: Initializes the result to 0.
- `for i in range(m)`: Iterates over each friendship.
- `(a, b, f) = friendships[i]`: Unpacks the friendship details.
- `result += f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`: For each friendship, it adds the product of the initial friendship value `f` and the sum of the first `k` natural numbers to the result. The sum of the first `k` natural numbers is given by \(\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\). This is then taken modulo `MOD`.
- `return result % MOD`: Returns the final result modulo `MOD`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**:
   - The provided code calculates the sum of friendship values for each pair over `k` excursions without considering the probability of each pair being chosen.
   - The expected value should account for the probability of each pair being chosen. Since the pairs are chosen equiprobably, the probability of any specific pair being chosen in one excursion is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - The expected value for a specific friendship pair over `k` excursions is not simply `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2)`. It should be weighted by the probability of being chosen.
   
2. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The modulo operation is applied correctly in the code, but the logic for calculating the expected value is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values according to the problem description. The issue lies in the incorrect calculation of the expected value for each friendship pair.

### Incorrect Case Example:
Consider a test case with `n = 3`, `m = 1`, `k = 2`, and a friendship pair `(1, 2, 1)`. The correct expected value should take into account the probability of the pair `(1, 2)` being chosen, which is \(\frac{1}{3}\) (since there are 3 possible pairs: `(1, 2)`, `(1, 3)`, `(2, 3)`). The expected value for this pair over 2 excursions should be calculated as:
\[ \text{Expected Value} = 1 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \cdot 1 + \frac{1}{3} \cdot 2 \right) = \frac{3}{3} = 1 \]
The provided code would incorrectly calculate it as:
\[ \text{Incorrect Calculation} = 1 \cdot \left( 2 \cdot 3 // 2 \right) = 3 \]

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**.
