Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that the friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time that pair is chosen for an excursion. The calculation `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` assumes that the friendship value remains constant at `f` for all `k` excursions, which is not the case.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen. For each pair of friends, the expected number of times it is chosen over `k` excursions is `k / C(n, 2)`, where `C(n, 2)` is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n`. The friendship value of this pair increases by 1 each time it is chosen, so the expected contribution of this pair to the total sum is the sum of an arithmetic series.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
    total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
    expected_sum = 0
    
    for a, b, f in friendships:
        # Expected number of times this pair is chosen
        expected_times_chosen = k / total_pairs
        # Expected contribution of this pair to the total sum
        expected_contribution = f * expected_times_chosen * (expected_times_chosen + 1) / 2 * total_pairs
        expected_sum += expected_contribution
    
    # Convert the expected sum to an integer fraction and compute the result modulo MOD
    from fractions import Fraction
    frac = Fraction(expected_sum).limit_denominator()
    p, q = frac.numerator, frac.denominator
    from sympy import mod_inverse
    return (p * mod_inverse(q, MOD)) % MOD

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        friendships = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        print(result)

# func_2()  # Uncomment this line to run the function
```

This corrected program calculates the expected value correctly and computes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
