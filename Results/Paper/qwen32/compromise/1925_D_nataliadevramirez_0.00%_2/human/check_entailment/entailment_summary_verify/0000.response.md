### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a fundamental flaw in the provided program's logic for calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values over the excursions. Let's break down the issues and verify whether the program is indeed incorrect based on the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective**: Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for excursions.
- **Key Points**:
  - Each pair of friends has an initial friendship value `f_i`.
  - Each time a pair is chosen, its friendship value increases by 1.
  - The expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), where `p` and `q` are coprime integers.
  - The final output is \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: Calculate the result for a single test case.
   - **Logic**:
     - Initializes `result` to 0.
     - Iterates over each friendship.
     - For each friendship `(a, b, f)`, adds `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` to `result`.
     - Returns `result % MOD`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: Read multiple test cases and apply `func_1` to each test case.
   - **Logic**:
     - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, reads `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of friendships.
     - Calls `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result.

#### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum of friendship values for each pair over `k` excursions without considering the probability of each pair being chosen.
   - The probability of any specific pair being chosen in one excursion is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\), where \(\binom{n}{2}\) is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n`.
   - The expected value for a specific friendship pair over `k` excursions should be weighted by the probability of being chosen.

2. **Probability Weighting**:
   - The expected value for a friendship pair `(a, b, f)` over `k` excursions should be:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = f \cdot \left( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} + \frac{k-1}{\binom{n}{2}} + \cdots + \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \right) = f \cdot \frac{k(k+1)/2}{\binom{n}{2}}
     \]
   - The program incorrectly calculates it as `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2)`, which does not account for the probability of being chosen.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The modulo operation is correctly applied in the code, but the logic for calculating the expected value is incorrect.

#### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values according to the problem description. The issue lies in the incorrect calculation of the expected value for each friendship pair, as it does not account for the probability of each pair being chosen.

### Final Answer:

Final: **False**.
