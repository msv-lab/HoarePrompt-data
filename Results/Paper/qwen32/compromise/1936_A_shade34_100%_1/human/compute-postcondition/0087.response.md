To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n):`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 4.
- `n` is greater than 4.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 5. The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop head.

The other variables (`t`, `mak2`, `pans`, and `mak`) are not part of the loop head and therefore should not be adjusted based on the loop's iteration logic.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 4, `mak2` is equal to its previous value, `pans` is unchanged, `i` is 5. If the input is `<`, then `mak` is set to 4.**
