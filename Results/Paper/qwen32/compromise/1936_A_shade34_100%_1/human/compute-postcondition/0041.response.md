Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `mak` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) where the input was `'<'`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is a list, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `s` is the string input from the user. If `s` equals `'='`, then `pans` contains the previous elements plus `i`.**
