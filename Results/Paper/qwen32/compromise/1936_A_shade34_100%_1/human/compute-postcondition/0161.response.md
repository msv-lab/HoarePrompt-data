Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `mak2` is unchanged (the value of `mak2` is not specified, so we'll ignore it since it's not used in the print statement).
- `pans` contains all indices where the response was '=', or only the last index where the response was '<' if there was one.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement starts with a literal question mark `'?'`.
- It then prints the value of `mak` twice.
- Finally, it prints the value of `i` twice.

From the initial state, we know:
- `mak` is not explicitly defined, so we'll represent it as `mak` in our output.
- `i` is `i + 1`, meaning `i` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value.

### Output:
Given the above analysis, the output will be a string starting with `'?'`, followed by the value of `mak` twice, and the value of `i` twice.

Output: **? mak mak i i (where mak is the value of mak and i is the incremented value of i)**
