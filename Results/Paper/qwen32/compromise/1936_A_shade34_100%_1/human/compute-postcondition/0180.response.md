The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³
- `n` is greater than 1
- `mak` is the highest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) where the response was '<'
- `mak2` is the highest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) where the response was '<'
- If `s` is equal to '<', `mak` is updated to `i`, `pans` is `[i]`
- If `s` is equal to '=', `pans` is a list containing the value `i`
- Otherwise, `pans` remains an empty list

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has taken some value from 0 to `n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` should remain unchanged as it determines the upper limit of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `n` remains the same

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is the highest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) where the response was '<', `mak2` is the highest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) where the response was '<', `i` is incremented by 1**
