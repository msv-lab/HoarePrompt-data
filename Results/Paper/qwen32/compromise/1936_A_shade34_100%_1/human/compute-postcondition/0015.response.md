To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is set to 4.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement contains five parts: `'?'`, `mak`, `mak`, `i`, and `i`.
- `'?'` is a literal string, so it will be printed as is.
- `mak` appears twice in the print statement, but its value is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine its exact value.
- `i` is explicitly stated to be 4, so it will be printed as 4.

### Conclusion:
Given that `mak` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot provide its exact value. However, we know the value of `i` is 4. Thus, the output will contain two unknown values (`mak`) and two known values (`4`).

### Final Output:
Output: **? [mak] [mak] 4 4 (where [mak] is the value of the variable mak)**
