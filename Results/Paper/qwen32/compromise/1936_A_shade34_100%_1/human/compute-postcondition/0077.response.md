To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³. However, `t` is not used in the print statement.
- `n` must be greater than 1. However, `n` is also not used in the print statement.
- `mak` is initialized to 0.
- `mak2` is equal to its previous value. Since no previous value is specified, we assume it is also initialized to 0.
- `pans` is mentioned as unchanged, but it is not used in the print statement.
- The variable `i` is used in the print statement, but it is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine its value from the given information.

Given this information, we can infer the following about the print statement:
- `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` is also 0 (since it is equal to its previous value, and we assume the initial value is 0).
- `i` is undefined based on the given initial state.

Since `i` is undefined, we cannot provide a specific value for it. However, we can still describe the output in terms of the known values and the unknown variable.

Output: **? 0 0 i i (where i is an undefined variable)**
