The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `mak`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `mak2` is equal to its previous value, `mak` is `i`, `pans` is a list containing at least two elements, and `i` is `i + 1`.**
