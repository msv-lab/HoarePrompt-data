The code assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. Given that `i` is 2, `mak` will now hold the value 2. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, and `pans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is unchanged, `mak2` is unchanged, `pans` contains at least two elements, `i` is 2, `mak` is 2**.
