To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variable `mak` based on the inputs it receives. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Loop Structure**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`. For each iteration, it prints a query and waits for an input. If the input is `'<'`, it updates `mak` to the current value of `i`.

2. **Final Iteration**: The last iteration of the loop will be when `i = n - 1`. After this iteration, the loop terminates.

3. **Determining `mak`**: The value of `mak` at the end of the loop will be the largest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`. If no input was `'<'`, `mak` will remain 0.

4. **Output State**: After all iterations, `mak` will hold the largest index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) where the input was `'<'`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the final output state can be described as follows:

- `t` remains the same as the initial value.
- `n` remains the same as the initial value.
- `mak` holds the largest index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) where the input was `'<'`. If no such input was received, `mak` remains 0.

Using the required format:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, and `mak` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) where the input was `'<'`. If no such input was received, `mak` remains 0.**
