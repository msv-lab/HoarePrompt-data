The provided Python code snippet includes a call to `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call does not alter the values of any variables; it merely ensures that any buffered output is written to the standard output immediately. Therefore, none of the variables `t`, `n`, `mak2`, `pans`, or `i` are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 4, `mak2` is equal to its previous value, `pans` is unchanged, `i` is 4**.
