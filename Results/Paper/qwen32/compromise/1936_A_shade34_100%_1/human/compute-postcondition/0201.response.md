Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `mak` is set to 0.
- `mak2` remains unchanged (its value is not specified, but it is irrelevant for this print statement).
- `pans` is a list of indices with at least two elements.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Analysis:
- `mak` is 0, so `pans[mak]` refers to the element at index 0 of the list `pans`.
- Since `mak` is 0, `pans[mak]` and `pans[mak]` will both refer to the same element, which is `pans[0]`.
- The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown. Therefore, `pans[i]` and `pans[i]` cannot be determined precisely without knowing the value of `i`.

### Conclusion:
- The first element printed is a literal question mark (`?`).
- The next two elements printed are both `pans[0]`, the element at index 0 of the list `pans`.
- The last two elements printed are `pans[i]` and `pans[i]`, where `i` is an undefined variable.

Given the lack of information about `i`, we can only describe the output in terms of the known values and the undefined variable.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]] (where i is an undefined variable and pans[0] is the first element of the list pans)**
