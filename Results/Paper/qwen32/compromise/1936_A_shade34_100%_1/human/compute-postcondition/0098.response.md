The code snippet reads a string input and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, `mak`, `mak2`, and `pans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` must be greater than 0, `mak` is the largest integer i (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was '<', `mak2` is the largest integer i (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was '<', `pans` is an empty list, `s` is the string input.**
