To ensure the correctness of the provided Python program, we will analyze both the logic and the annotated version systematically. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Problem Recap
- **Objective**: Find the maximum number of draws in a series of chess games among three players, given their final scores.
- **Constraints**: 
  - Scores are non-decreasing: \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).
  - Total points must be even (since each game contributes 2 points, either through a win/loss or a draw).
  - If the total points are odd, it's impossible to achieve the given scores with any valid set of games.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases and processes each one as follows:
1. **Input Handling**: Reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, reads three scores \( p_1, p_2, p_3 \).
2. **Total Points Check**: Checks if the total points \( p_1 + p_2 + p_3 \) are even. If not, it prints `-1`.
3. **Draws Calculation**: If the total points are even, it calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
   \[
   \text{result} = \left( p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - \max(0, p_3 - p_0 - p_1) \right) // 2
   \]

### Formula Verification
The formula aims to maximize the number of draws by minimizing the points attributed to wins. Here's a detailed breakdown:
- **Term \( \max(0, p_3 - p_0 - p_1) \)**: This term adjusts the calculation to ensure that the highest score \( p_3 \) is not attributed more points than necessary to the wins, allowing the remaining points to be attributed to draws.
- **Correctness**: The formula is designed to ensure that the points can be distributed in a way that respects the constraints of the problem, i.e., the total points being even and the scores being consistent with a valid set of games.

### Testing with Examples
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**: `0 0 0`
   - Total points: \( 0 \) (even)
   - Draws: \( (0 + 0 + 0 - \max(0, 0 - 0 - 0)) // 2 = 0 \)
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **Example 2**: `0 1 1`
   - Total points: \( 2 \) (even)
   - Draws: \( (0 + 1 + 1 - \max(0, 1 - 0 - 1)) // 2 = 1 \)
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Example 3**: `1 1 1`
   - Total points: \( 3 \) (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

4. **Example 4**: `1 1 2`
   - Total points: \( 4 \) (even)
   - Draws: \( (1 + 1 + 2 - \max(0, 2 - 1 - 1)) // 2 = 2 \)
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Example 5**: `3 3 3`
   - Total points: \( 9 \) (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

6. **Example 6**: `3 4 5`
   - Total points: \( 12 \) (even)
   - Draws: \( (3 + 4 + 5 - \max(0, 5 - 3 - 4)) // 2 = 6 \)
   - Output: `6` (Correct)

7. **Example 7**: `1 1 10`
   - Total points: \( 12 \) (even)
   - Draws: \( (1 + 1 + 10 - \max(0, 10 - 1 - 1)) // 2 = 2 \)
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

### Conclusion
The program correctly handles the constraints and calculates the maximum number of draws for each test case. The formula used is valid and consistent with the problem description. All provided examples produce the correct output.
