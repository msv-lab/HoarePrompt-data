Reasoning:
The program follows a specific logic to determine the maximum number of draws based on the provided scores. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Sum of Scores Check**: The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1`. This is because, in any valid set of games, the total points awarded must be even (since each game awards either 2 points in total or 2 points split as 1+1 in case of a draw).

2. **Calculation of Maximum Draws**: If the sum of the scores is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2}
   \]
   This formula essentially tries to maximize the number of draws by considering the highest possible score (`v[2]`) and the other two scores (`v[0]` and `v[1]`).

3. **Explanation of the Formula**:
   - `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]` gives the total points awarded.
   - `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` adjusts for the case where `v[2]` is significantly higher than the sum of `v[0]` and `v[1]`, which would not be possible if all games were draws or if the scores were distributed evenly among wins and draws.
   - The result is then divided by 2 because each draw contributes 2 points in total.

The program correctly handles the edge cases and constraints provided in the problem description. It checks for the consistency of the scores and calculates the maximum number of draws accurately.

Correctness: **True**
