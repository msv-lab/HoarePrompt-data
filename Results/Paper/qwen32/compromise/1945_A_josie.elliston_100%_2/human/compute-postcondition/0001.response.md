Output State: **The program returns -1 if `ret` is None, otherwise it returns the sum of `introverts` and `ret`.**

To break it down:
- If `ret` is `None`, the program returns `-1`.
- If `ret` is not `None`, the program returns the sum of `introverts` and `ret`.

Since `ret` is the value returned by `func_1(extroverts, universals)`, the final output depends on the value returned by `func_1`.
