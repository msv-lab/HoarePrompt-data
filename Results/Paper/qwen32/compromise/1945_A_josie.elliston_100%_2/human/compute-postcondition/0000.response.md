To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the code `ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)`. Here, `func_1` is a function that takes `extroverts` and `universals` as arguments and returns some value, which is then assigned to `ret`. Since the definition and behavior of `func_1` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `ret`. However, we can state that `ret` will hold the value returned by `func_1(extroverts, universals)`.

The values of `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` remain unchanged unless `func_1` modifies them, which is not implied by the given code snippet. Therefore, the output state will include the unchanged values of `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`, along with the new variable `ret` holding the return value of `func_1`.

Output State: **`introverts` is a non-negative integer, `extroverts` is a non-negative integer, `universals` is a non-negative integer, `ret` is the value returned by `func_1(extroverts, universals)`**.
