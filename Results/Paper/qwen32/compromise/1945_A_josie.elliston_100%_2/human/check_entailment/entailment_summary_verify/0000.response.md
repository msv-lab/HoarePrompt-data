### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the provided program. Let's break down the code and the logic to understand why the assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- **Purpose**: This function is supposed to determine the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
- **Logic**:
  - If the number of extroverts (`extroverts`) is not a multiple of 3 (`extroverts % 3 != 0`), it checks whether the sum of `extroverts % 3` and `universals` is less than 3.
  - If the sum is less than 3, it returns `None`, indicating it's impossible to form valid groups of three.
  - Otherwise, it calculates the number of tents required using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- **Purpose**: This function calculates the total number of tents required by adding the number of tents for introverts to the result of `func_1`.
- **Logic**:
  - It calls `func_1` with `extroverts` and `universals`.
  - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns `-1`.
  - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts and the result from `func_1`.

#### Flaw in the Code:
- The flaw lies in the logic of `func_1`. The condition `if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3` is too strict. It does not account for scenarios where the number of universals can be used to form valid groups of three with the extroverts, even if `extroverts % 3` is not zero.
- For example, in the test case `0 1 1`:
  - `extroverts % 3` is `1`, and `universals` is `1`.
  - The condition `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3` evaluates to `1 + 1 < 3`, which is true.
  - Therefore, `func_1` returns `None`, leading `func_2` to return `-1`.

#### Correct Handling:
- The condition should be adjusted to allow for cases where universals can fill the remaining spots to form valid groups of three with extroverts.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases, specifically when the number of extroverts is not a multiple of three but there are enough universals to form valid groups of three. The code needs to be adjusted to handle such scenarios correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
