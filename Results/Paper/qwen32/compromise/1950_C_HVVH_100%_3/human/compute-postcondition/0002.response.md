In the given task, the for loop is defined as:

```python
for _ in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the range function generates at least one iteration, which depends on the value of `n`. The loop head only involves the variable `n` and the underscore `_` (which is a conventional way to indicate that the loop variable is not used).

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440
- `day` is 'AM'
- `n` is an input integer

The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `n`. To make sure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `n` is greater than 0. The variables `t` and `day` do not affect the execution of the loop and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0**
