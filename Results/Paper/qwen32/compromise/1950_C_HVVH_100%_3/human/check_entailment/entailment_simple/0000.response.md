### Reasoning:
The provided Python program is designed to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format, appending the appropriate period ('AM' or 'PM').

Let's break down the logic and verify it against the provided test cases:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` in the format "hh:mm".

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The string `s` is split into hours `h` and minutes `m`.
   - The logic for converting the 24-hour format to 12-hour format is as follows:
     - If `h` is 0 (midnight), it sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'.
     - If `h` is greater than 12 (PM times), it converts `h` to the equivalent 12-hour format by subtracting 12 and sets `day` to 'PM'.
     - If `h` is less than or equal to 12, it sets `day` to 'AM'.
       - If `h` is exactly 12 (noon), it sets `day` to 'PM'.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the converted time in the format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM".

### Verification Against Test Cases:
Let's verify the program's correctness with the example test cases:

- **09:41**: `h=9, m=41` -> `h=9, m=41, day='AM'` -> Correct output: `09:41 AM`
- **18:06**: `h=18, m=6` -> `h=6, m=6, day='PM'` -> Correct output: `06:06 PM`
- **12:14**: `h=12, m=14` -> `h=12, m=14, day='PM'` -> Correct output: `12:14 PM`
- **00:59**: `h=0, m=59` -> `h=12, m=59, day='AM'` -> Correct output: `12:59 AM`
- **00:00**: `h=0, m=0` -> `h=12, m=0, day='AM'` -> Correct output: `12:00 AM`
- **14:34**: `h=14, m=34` -> `h=2, m=34, day='PM'` -> Correct output: `02:34 PM`
- **01:01**: `h=1, m=1` -> `h=1, m=1, day='AM'` -> Correct output: `01:01 AM`
- **19:07**: `h=19, m=7` -> `h=7, m=7, day='PM'` -> Correct output: `07:07 PM`
- **11:59**: `h=11, m=59` -> `h=11, m=59, day='AM'` -> Correct output: `11:59 AM`
- **12:00**: `h=12, m=0` -> `h=12, m=0, day='PM'` -> Correct output: `12:00 PM`
- **21:37**: `h=21, m=37` -> `h=9, m=37, day='PM'` -> Correct output: `09:37 PM`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the provided test cases and implements the conversion logic accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Your response:
Correctness: **True**
