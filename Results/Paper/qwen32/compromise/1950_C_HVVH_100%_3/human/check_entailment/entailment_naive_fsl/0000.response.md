Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 

The provided code does not handle the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format correctly for all edge cases. Specifically, the code incorrectly handles the hour "12" in both AM and PM cases. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. If the hour is "00", it correctly converts it to "12 AM".
2. If the hour is "12", it incorrectly converts it to "12 AM" instead of "12 PM".
3. If the hour is greater than "12", it correctly converts it to the equivalent PM time.
4. If the hour is between "01" and "11", it correctly converts it to the equivalent AM time.

Let's consider the problematic case where the input time is "12:00". According to the problem description, "12:00" in 24-hour format should be converted to "12:00 PM" in 12-hour format. However, the current code will convert "12:00" to "12:00 AM".

To fix this, we need to adjust the logic to correctly handle the "12" hour in both AM and PM cases.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

This corrected code will handle the conversion correctly for all edge cases.
