Let's walk through the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` of the form "hh:mm" and splits it into hours `h` and minutes `m`.

2. **Conversion Logic:**
   - If `h` is 0, it sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'. This correctly handles the conversion of midnight (00:00) to 12:00 AM.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM'. This correctly handles the conversion of PM times.
   - If `h` is less than or equal to 12, it sets `day` to 'PM'. However, there is a nested check for `h` being 12, which sets `day` to 'AM'. This correctly handles the conversion of noon (12:00) to 12:00 PM.

3. **Output:**
   - The program then prints the converted time in the format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM" using an f-string, ensuring that hours and minutes are always two digits by using `:02d`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Midnight (00:00) is correctly converted to 12:00 AM.
   - Noon (12:00) is correctly converted to 12:00 PM.
   - All other times are correctly converted to their 12-hour format equivalents.

After analyzing the program, it is clear that it handles all specified cases correctly according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
