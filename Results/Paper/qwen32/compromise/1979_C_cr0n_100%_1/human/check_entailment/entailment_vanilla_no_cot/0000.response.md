Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not guarantee that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes will be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. The approach taken in the program calculates a common denominator and then distributes the bets based on that, but it does not ensure that the total bet is less than the payout for each outcome.

For example, consider the test case:
```
3
3 2 7
```
The program might output something like `27 41 12`, which sums up to 80. However, for the second outcome, the payout would be `2 * 41 = 82`, which is indeed greater than 80, but this is not guaranteed for all outcomes. For the first outcome, the payout would be `3 * 27 = 81`, which is also greater than 80, but this is not guaranteed by the logic in the program. 

The key issue is that the program does not explicitly check that the total bet is less than the payout for each outcome after distributing the bets. Instead, it relies on the calculation of the common denominator and the distribution of bets based on that, which does not inherently guarantee the required condition. 

A correct approach would involve ensuring that the total bet is less than the payout for each outcome, which might require a different method of distributing the bets.
