### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

The program is designed to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `k_i` for each outcome. The goal is to find a way to distribute the bets such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `k_i` are read.

2. **Calculating the Least Common Multiple (LCM):**
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula: `LCM(a, b) = (a * b) // gcd(a, b)`.
   - In `func_2()`, the LCM of all multipliers `k_i` is computed and stored in `den`.

3. **Computing the Bet Distribution:**
   - A list `vprod` is created where each element is `den // k_i` for each `k_i` in `vals`. This essentially divides the LCM by each multiplier.
   - The sum of `vprod` is subtracted from `den`. If the result is less than or equal to zero, it means no valid distribution is possible, and `-1` is printed.
   - If the result is positive, the elements of `vprod` are printed as the bet distribution.

### Correctness Analysis:

Let's verify if the logic correctly meets the problem's requirements:

- **LCM Calculation:** The LCM of the multipliers ensures that the total bet is a common multiple of all multipliers. This is a crucial step because it guarantees that the total bet can be evenly distributed across the outcomes in a way that respects the multipliers.
  
- **Bet Distribution:** The list `vprod` is computed by dividing the LCM by each multiplier. This ensures that if a particular outcome wins, the bet on that outcome will be multiplied by its respective multiplier to exceed the total bet.

- **Validation:** The sum of `vprod` is subtracted from `den`. If the result is less than or equal to zero, it implies that the total bet cannot be strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome, hence `-1` is correctly returned.

- **Output:** If a valid distribution exists, the elements of `vprod` are printed as the bet distribution.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the required bet distribution or return `-1` if no such distribution exists. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
