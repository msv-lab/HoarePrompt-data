The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`, which iterates over the list `a`. To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the list `a` and its relationship with `num`.

Given the conditions:
- `a` is a list of integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times.
- The length of the list `a` is exactly `n`.
- `count_a` is an empty dictionary (though `count_a` is not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted).

The loop will execute if `a` has at least one element. Since the length of `a` is exactly `n` and `n` is at least 1, `a` will always have at least one element.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to ensure the loop executes. The state before the loop starts already meets the criteria for the loop to execute.

State: **`a` is a list of integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, and the length of the list `a` is exactly `n`; `count_a` is an empty dictionary**.
