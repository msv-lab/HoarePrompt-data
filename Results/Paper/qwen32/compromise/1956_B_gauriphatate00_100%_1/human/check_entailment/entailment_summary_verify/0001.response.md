### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of points you can get if you play optimally, given the distribution of cards. The key insight is that the maximum points you can score is determined by the number of pairs of cards you have in your hand, as these pairs can potentially score points if you place both cards optimally.

Let's break down the code and the function summary:

1. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `a` of integers and an integer `n`.
   - It counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`.
   - It calculates the number of integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly twice in the list `a`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it counts the occurrences of each card in the player's hand.
   - It calculates the maximum possible points by counting pairs of cards in the player's hand.

3. **Correctness**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of pairs in the player's hand.
   - Since the problem asks for the maximum number of points you can get if you play optimally, and the maximum points are determined by the pairs in your hand, the function correctly calculates this value.
   - The function does not need to simulate the game or consider the opponent's strategy because the question only asks for the maximum score you can achieve with optimal play, which is determined by the pairs in your hand.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can get if you play optimally based on the pairs in your hand. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function, and the program logic aligns with the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
