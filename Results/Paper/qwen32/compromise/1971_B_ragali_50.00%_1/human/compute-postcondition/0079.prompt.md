Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer value from input, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    s = input().strip(' ')
    a = set()
    for i in s:
        a.add(i)
    if len(a) > 1:
        print('YES')
        newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
        isreverse = s[::-1]
        if newstr != s:
            print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
        elif isreverse != s:
            print(isreverse)
        else:
            print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters with no leading or trailing spaces, and `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the string `s`. If the length of `a` is greater than 1, `s` is rearranged such that the second half is moved to the front, and `isreverse` is the reversed string of `s`. If `newstr` is not equal to `s`, the condition remains as stated. Otherwise, `newstr` is equal to `s`, and if `isreverse` is not equal to `s`, the condition is met. If `isreverse` is equal to `s`, this specific condition is also noted. If the length of `a` is 1 or less, `s` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters with no leading or trailing spaces, `a` is a set containing all unique characters from `s`, and `i` is the last character of `s`. If the length of `a` is greater than 1, `newstr` is the string `s` rearranged by moving the second half to the front and the first half to the back, and `isreverse` is the reverse of `s`. If `newstr` is not equal to `s`, then `newstr` is not equal to `s`. If `newstr` is equal to `s`, then `isreverse` is equal to `s` if and only if `s` is a palindrome. If the length of `a` is 1, then there are no additional variables `newstr` or `isreverse` introduced.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters with no leading or trailing spaces, `a` is a set containing all unique characters from `s`, `i` is the last character of `s`. If `a` has more than one element, then `newstr` is the string `s` rotated by moving the second half to the front, and `isreverse` is the reversed string of `s`. If `newstr` is not equal to `s`, then `newstr` is a rotated version of `s`. Otherwise, `newstr` is equal to `s` and `isreverse` is either equal to `s` (if `s` is a palindrome) or not equal to `s` (if `s` is not a palindrome). If `a` has only one element, then the length of `a` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
