Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters with no leading or trailing spaces, `a` is a set containing all unique characters from `s` and has more than one element, `i` is the last character of `s`, `newstr` is the string `s` rotated by moving the second half to the front, `isreverse` is the reversed string of `s`. If `newstr` is not equal to `s`, then `newstr` is a rotated version of `s`. Otherwise, `newstr` is equal to `s` and `isreverse` is either equal to `s` (if `s` is a palindrome) or not equal to `s` (if `s` is not a palindrome).**
