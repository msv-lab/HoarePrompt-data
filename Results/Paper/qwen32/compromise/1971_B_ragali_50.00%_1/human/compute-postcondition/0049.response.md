Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters with no leading or trailing spaces, `a` is a set containing all unique characters from `s` and the length of `a` is greater than 1, `i` is the last character of `s`, `newstr` is the string `s` rearranged by moving the second half to the front and the first half to the back, `isreverse` is the reverse of `s`. If `newstr` is not equal to `s`, then `newstr` is not equal to `s`. If `newstr` is equal to `s`, then `isreverse` is equal to `s` if and only if `s` is a palindrome.**
