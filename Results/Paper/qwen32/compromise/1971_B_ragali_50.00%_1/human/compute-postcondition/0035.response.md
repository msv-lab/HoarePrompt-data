The code snippet `a.add(i)` adds the second character of the string `s` to the set `a`, which already contains the first and last characters of `s`. Since `a` is a set, it will only contain unique elements. Therefore, if the second character `i` is already either the first or last character of `s`, the set `a` will not change in size but will still contain the unique characters.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters with no leading or trailing spaces, `a` is a set containing the first, second, and last characters of `s`, `i` is the second character of `s`**.
