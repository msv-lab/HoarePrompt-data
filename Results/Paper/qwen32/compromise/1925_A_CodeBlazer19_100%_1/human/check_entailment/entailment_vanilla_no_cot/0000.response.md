Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program simply repeats the first `k` letters of the alphabet `n` times, which does not guarantee that all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` letters are present in the resulting string.

For example, consider the test case `n=2` and `k=2`. The program would output `aabb`, but this string does not contain all possible subsequences of length 2 using the letters 'a' and 'b'. The correct output should be `baab` or `abab` or any other string that includes all subsequences `aa`, `ab`, `ba`, and `bb`.

To solve the problem correctly, one must generate a De Bruijn sequence for the given `n` and `k`, which is a cyclic sequence in which every possible string of length `n` appears as a substring. However, the problem asks for a string where every possible string of length `n` appears as a subsequence, which is a different requirement. A simple solution to ensure all subsequences are present is to concatenate all possible strings of length `n` in lexicographical order, but this may not yield the smallest possible string.

Here is a corrected version of the program that generates all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` letters and concatenates them:

```python
from itertools import product

def generate_string(n, k):
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k]
    all_subsequences = [''.join(p) for p in product(alphabet, repeat=n)]
    return ''.join(all_subsequences)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(generate_string(n, k))

func()
```

This program generates all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` letters and concatenates them, ensuring that all subsequences are present. However, it does not guarantee the smallest possible string, but it is a valid solution based on the problem statement.
