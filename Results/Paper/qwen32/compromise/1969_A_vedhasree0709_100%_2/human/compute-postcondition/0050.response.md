The value of `q` is updated to `l[p - 1]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `p`, and `j` remain unchanged. Since `p` is `l[1]`, the new value of `q` is the element in `l` at the index `l[1] - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is at least 2; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 1; `p` is `l[1]`; `q` is `l[l[1] - 1]`; `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `q` equals `i + 1` or not.**
