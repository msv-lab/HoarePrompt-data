The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `l`. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is `n`; `j` is `0`.**

In simpler terms, `t`, `n`, `i`, and `j` retain their initial values, while `l` is now a list of integers provided by the new input.
