The `print` statement in the given code snippet is `print(2)`. This statement directly prints the integer value `2` regardless of the values of any other variables or conditions in the initial state.

Let's break it down step by step:
- The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `p`, `q`, and `j`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement explicitly specifies the value `2` to be printed.

Therefore, the output is simply the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
