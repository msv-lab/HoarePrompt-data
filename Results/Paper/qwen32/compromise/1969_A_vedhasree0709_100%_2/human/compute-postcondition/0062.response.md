Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is at least 3; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 2; `p` is `l[2]`; `q` is `l[l[2] - 1]`; if `q` equals `i + 1`, then `j` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.**
