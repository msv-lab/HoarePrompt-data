Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` must be at least 3; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 2; `p` is `l[2]`; `q` is `l[l[2] - 1]`; `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
