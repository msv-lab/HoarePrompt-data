Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 4999; `n` must be at least 3; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 2; `j` is 1 if the element at index `p - 1` in `l` (where `p` is the element at index 2 in `l`) is equal to 3, otherwise `j` is 0; `p` is the element at index 2 in `l`; `q` is the element at index `p - 1` in `l`. If `q` equals `i + 1`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
