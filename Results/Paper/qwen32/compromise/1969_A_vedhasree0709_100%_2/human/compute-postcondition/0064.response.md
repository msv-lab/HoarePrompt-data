To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the loop's behavior and the given conditions.

The loop runs while `i <= n - 1`. After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the loop will execute `n` times unless it breaks out of the loop earlier due to the condition `if q == i + 1`.

Here's the breakdown of the loop's behavior:
- The loop initializes `i` to 0.
- For each iteration, it calculates `p = l[i]` and `q = l[p - 1]`.
- If `q` equals `i + 1`, it prints `2`, sets `j` to 1, and breaks out of the loop.
- If the loop doesn't break, it continues until `i` reaches `n`.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop executed at least 3 times without breaking. This means that for `i = 0`, `i = 1`, and `i = 2`, the condition `q == i + 1` was not met.

After `n` iterations, the loop will either have broken out of the loop due to the condition `q == i + 1` or completed all `n` iterations without breaking.

Thus, the final state will be:
- `i` will be `n` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking.
- `j` will be `1` if the loop breaks out at any point, otherwise, it will remain `0`.

In natural language, the final state of the variables after the loop has finished executing all iterations will be:
- `i` will be equal to `n` if the loop did not break out early.
- `j` will be `1` if the loop broke out early because it found a `q` equal to `i + 1` for some `i`; otherwise, `j` will be `0`.

Therefore, the final output state is:
Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; n is the input integer; l is a list of integers obtained from the input; i is n; j is 0 or 1 depending on whether the loop broke out early.**
