The code snippet sets the value of `j` to 1, regardless of its previous value. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 4999; `n` must be at least 3; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 2; `j` is 1; `p` is the element at index 2 in `l`; `q` is the element at index `p - 1` in `l`.**
