Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem in all cases. Here are the reasons:

1. The program only checks for pairs of friends who are each other's best friends (i.e., `q == i + 1`). However, this is not sufficient to find the minimum number of invitations needed in all cases.

2. If such a pair is found, the program correctly prints `2` because only two invitations are needed for those two friends to attend the party. However, if no such pair is found, the program prints `3` without considering other possible configurations that might require only two invitations.

3. The program does not account for cases where more complex configurations of friendships might allow for at least two friends to attend with fewer than three invitations.

To correctly solve the problem, a more comprehensive approach is needed, such as finding cycles in the friendship graph and determining the minimum number of invitations required based on the structure of these cycles.
