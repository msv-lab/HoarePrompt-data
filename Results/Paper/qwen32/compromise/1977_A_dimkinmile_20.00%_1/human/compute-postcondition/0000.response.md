The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. Since the code assigns new values to `n` and `m`, the previous values of `n` and `m` are overwritten.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.**
