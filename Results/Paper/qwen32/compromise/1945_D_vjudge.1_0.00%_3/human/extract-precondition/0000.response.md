Precondition: **This function does not take any parameters. It is designed to read the number of test cases from the input and then call another function `func_1()` for each test case.** 

However, since the problem asks for a precondition based on the variables in the function signature, and `func_2()` does not have any parameters, there are no variables to describe in terms of preconditions. If we consider the context of the problem and the role of `func_2()`, it can be inferred that it expects the input to be formatted as described in the problem statement, but this is not a precondition on the function signature itself. 

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the function signature is:

Precondition: **(No parameters, thus no specific precondition on variables.)**
