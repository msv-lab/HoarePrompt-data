### Reasoning:

The given problem requires us to determine the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to move to one of the first `m` positions in a queue. Kirill can bribe people to move ahead, and the cost of bribery depends on the position he bribes and the people he moves through.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:

1. **Input Parsing and Reversal**:
    - The function reads `n` (number of people in the queue) and `k` (maximum allowable final position of Kirill).
    - It then reads two lists, `lista_A` and `lista_B`, representing the costs to bribe a person and the costs to bribe through others, respectively.
    - Both `lista_A` and `lista_B` are reversed. This means that the first elements in the original lists now correspond to the last positions in the queue.

2. **Calculating Costs**:
    - `soma_b` is initialized to 0 and will accumulate the sum of `b_i` values where `a_i >= b_i` for positions up to `n-k`.
    - `pref` is initialized to 0 and will accumulate the total cost of bribes based on the conditions.

3. **Iterating through the Queue**:
    - The function iterates through the first `n-k` positions of the reversed lists.
    - For each position `i` in this range, it checks if `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`. If true, it adds `soma_b` and `lista_A[i]` to `pref` and resets `soma_b` to 0. Otherwise, it adds `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b`.

4. **Finding the Minimum Cost**:
    - The function then iterates through the remaining positions from `n-k` to `n-1` in the reversed lists.
    - For each position `i` in this range, it calculates the cost as `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` and updates `resultado` with the minimum cost found.
    - It also updates `soma_b` by adding `lista_B[i]`.

5. **Output**:
    - The function prints the minimum cost stored in `resultado`.

#### Analysis of `func_2`:

- `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- It ensures that the solution for each test case is computed and printed independently.

### Correctness:

The algorithm implemented in `func_1` correctly computes the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue. By reversing the lists, it effectively processes the queue from the back to the front, which simplifies the logic for calculating the cumulative costs.

The logic for accumulating `soma_b` and `pref` ensures that the function correctly accounts for both the direct bribery costs and the costs of moving through others. The final iteration through the last `k` positions ensures that the minimum cost is found among all possible positions Kirill can reach.

Given the problem constraints and the provided implementation, the functions together correctly solve the problem.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
