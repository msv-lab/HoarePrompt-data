You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of people in the queue besides Kirill, and k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n. lista_A is a list of n integers where each element a_i represents the cost Kirill has to pay to bribe the i-th person. lista_B is a list of n integers where each element b_i represents the cost Kirill has to pay to each person between the j-th and i-th person when bribing the j-th person to position i.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_A.reverse()
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B.reverse()
    soma_b = 0
    pref = 0
    for i in range(n - k):
        if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:
            pref += soma_b
            pref += lista_A[i]
            soma_b = 0
        else:
            soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: - `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
    #- `lista_A` and `lista_B` remain unchanged.
    #- `soma_b` will be the sum of elements in `lista_B` from indices `0` to `n-k-1` where `lista_A[i] >= lista_B[i]`.
    #- `pref` will be the accumulated sum based on the conditions described above.
    #
    #Output State:
    resultado = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - k, n):
        resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])
        
        soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: `n` and `k` remain unchanged; `lista_A` and `lista_B` remain unchanged; `soma_b` is the sum of elements in `lista_B` from indices `0` to `n-1` where `lista_A[i] >= lista_B[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-k-1`, plus the sum of elements in `lista_B` from indices `n-k` to `n-1`; `pref` remains unchanged; `resultado` is the minimum value of `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for `i` from `n-k` to `n-1`.
    print(resultado)
    #This is printed: resultado (where resultado is the minimum value of pref + soma_b + lista_A[i] for i from n-k to n-1)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of people in the queue besides Kirill; `k`, a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n; and `lista_A`, a list of n integers where each element `a_i` represents the cost Kirill has to pay to bribe the i-th person. Additionally, it accepts `lista_B`, a list of n integers where each element `b_i` represents the cost Kirill has to pay to each person between the j-th and i-th person when bribing the j-th person to position i. The function returns the minimum total cost Kirill has to pay to bribe his way to the k-th position in the queue.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
