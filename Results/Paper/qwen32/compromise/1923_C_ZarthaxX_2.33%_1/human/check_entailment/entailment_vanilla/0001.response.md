Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine if a subarray can be transformed into another array `b` such that:
1. The sum of the subarray `a` is equal to the sum of `b`.
2. Each element in `a` is different from the corresponding element in `b`.
3. All elements in `b` are positive.

### Key Observations:
- For a subarray to be good, it must contain at least two elements because a single-element subarray cannot satisfy the condition `a_i != b_i`.
- If a subarray contains only `1`s, it cannot be good because the only possible `b` would be `2`s, and the sum would not be equal.
- For a subarray to be good, the sum of the subarray minus the number of `1`s in it should be at least the number of elements in the subarray minus the number of `1`s.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses two auxiliary arrays:
- `ones`: to keep a running count of the number of `1`s up to each index.
- `sum`: to keep a running count of the sum of the subarray elements minus the number of `1`s up to each index.

For each query, the program calculates:
- `onesInRange`: the number of `1`s in the subarray.
- `sumInRange`: the sum of the subarray elements minus the number of `1`s.

It then checks if the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` holds. This condition is derived from the requirement that the sum of `b` (which is the sum of `a` minus the number of `1`s plus the number of `1`s that need to be increased to `2`s) should be equal to the sum of `a`.

### Detailed Reasoning:
- `2 * onesInRange` accounts for the fact that each `1` in `a` would need to become `2` in `b`.
- `(r - l + 1) - onesInRange` accounts for the other elements in the subarray which can be any positive number different from their original value.
- `sumInRange` is the sum of the subarray elements minus the number of `1`s, which is the sum we need to match after adjusting for the `1`s becoming `2`s.

The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` ensures that the adjusted sum can be achieved by changing the subarray elements according to the rules.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
