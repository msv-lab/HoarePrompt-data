Correctness: **False**

The issue with the provided program is that the function `func_1` is defined after it is called in the loop. In Python, functions need to be defined before they are used. To fix this, you should move the definition of `func_1` before the loop where it is called. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))
```

With this change, the program should work as expected.
