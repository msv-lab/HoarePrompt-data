In the given task, the for loop iterates over each character `ch` in the string `password`. The variables `letters` and `digits` are not part of the loop head, so we cannot adjust their states to ensure the loop executes. The only variable in the loop head is `ch`, which is assigned a value from `password` during each iteration.

To ensure the loop can execute, the string `password` must have at least one character. Given that the state before the loop starts specifies that `password` is a string of length `n` where `1 <= n <= 20`, the loop will execute because `password` is guaranteed to have at least one character.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute as per the given state.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is an empty list, `digits` is an empty list**
