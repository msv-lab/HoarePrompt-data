To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the game and the strategy involved.

### Game Analysis:
1. **Initial Conditions**: Alice starts with `a` coins, and Bob starts with `b` coins.
2. **Turns and Moves**:
   - In each turn, the player can either swap wallets or keep the current wallet.
   - The player then removes one coin from their current wallet.
3. **Winning Condition**: The player who cannot make a move (i.e., when both wallets are empty) loses.

### Strategy:
The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the parity (odd/even nature) of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. Here's why:
- If the difference `abs(a - b)` is even, it means that no matter how Alice and Bob play optimally, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position.
- If the difference `abs(a - b)` is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position.

### Explanation:
- **Even Difference**: If `a - b` is even, Alice and Bob can always mirror each other's moves. If Alice swaps, Bob swaps, and if Alice removes a coin, Bob removes a coin from the other wallet. This way, Bob can always ensure that when Alice is forced to make a move, she will be in a losing position.
- **Odd Difference**: If `a - b` is odd, Alice can start by making a move that ensures the difference remains odd after her turn. This forces Bob into a position where he will eventually be the one who cannot make a move.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements this strategy by checking the parity of the absolute difference between `a` and `b`. If the difference is even, Bob wins; if it's odd, Alice wins.

### Correctness:
The program is correct based on the analysis.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
