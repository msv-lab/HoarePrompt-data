### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program systematically to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob take turns, starting with Alice.
- Each turn, a player can choose to swap wallets or not, then must remove one coin from the current wallet.
- The player who can't make a move loses.
- Both play optimally.

#### Key Observations:
1. **When `a == b`:**
   - Alice can always mirror Bob's moves.
   - Alice can ensure that Bob is always left with the last coin, making Bob lose.
   - Therefore, Alice wins when `a == b`.

2. **When `a != b`:**
   - The player with more coins can force a win by always making the difference between the number of coins in their wallets odd after their turn.
   - This strategy ensures that the other player is always left with an even difference, eventually leading to a losing position.
   - Therefore, the player with the larger number of coins wins when `a != b`.

#### Given Program Analysis:
The program determines the winner based on whether the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd:
- If `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`, it prints "Bob".
- Otherwise, it prints "Alice".

#### Correctness Verification:
- **Case 1: `a == b`**
  - The difference is 0, which is even.
  - According to the program, Bob wins.
  - However, as per the observations, Alice should win by mirroring Bob's moves.
  - This is a contradiction.

- **Case 2: `a != b`**
  - If the difference is odd, Alice wins, which aligns with the observations.
  - If the difference is even, Bob wins, which contradicts the observations (Bob should lose if the difference is even because Alice can always force a win).

#### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the winner based on the optimal strategies described in the problem statement. Specifically, it incorrectly handles the case when `a == b`.

### Example of Incorrectness:
For `a = 1` and `b = 1`:
- The program outputs "Bob".
- The correct output should be "Alice" because Alice can mirror Bob's moves until the end, ensuring her win.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**.
