Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers representing the number of coins Alice and Bob have. For each test case, it prints 'Bob' if the absolute difference between the number of coins Alice and Bob have is even, and 'Alice' if the difference is odd.**
