The only variables in the loop head are `k` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is `n - j`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `n - j` for the loop to continue.

Let's break it down step-by-step:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is `n - j`.
- For the next iteration, `k` should be `k + 1`, which is `(n - j) + 1`.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is less than `n - j`.

Since `k` is incremented by 1, the new value of `k` at the start of the next iteration should be `n - j + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a list of characters with length `n` where 2 <= n <= 5000, `n` is the length of `s`, `j` is 1, `k` is `n - j + 1`. If either `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` is 0. Additionally, `count` is not equal to `j`.**
