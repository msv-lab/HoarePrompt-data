Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a list of characters with length `n` where 2 <= n <= 5000, `n` is the length of `s`, `j` is an integer such that 0 <= j < n. `count` is not equal to `j`. If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` is 0 and neither `s[k]` nor `s[k + j]` is '?', and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`.**
