To determine what will be printed by the `print(count * 2)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and conditions step by step.

1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `s` is a list of characters with length `n` where \(2 \leq n \leq 5000\).
   - `j` is set to 1.
   - `k` is set to \(n - j\), which means `k` is \(n - 1\).
   - The value of `count` is determined by the following conditions:
     - If either `s[k]` is `'?'` or `s[k + j]` is `'?'` or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 3.
     - Otherwise, `count` is 0.
   - Additionally, `count` is not equal to `j` (which is 1).

2. **Determine the Value of `count`:**
   - Since `j` is 1, `k` is \(n - 1\).
   - The condition to determine `count` involves checking:
     - `s[k]` (which is `s[n - 1]`).
     - `s[k + j]` (which is `s[n - 1 + 1]` or `s[n]`).
   - Since `s` is a list of length `n`, `s[n]` is out of bounds and would typically raise an error. However, given the context, it's reasonable to assume the problem intends to check `s[n - 1]` and `s[n - 2]` instead.
   - Thus, the condition should be interpreted as:
     - If either `s[n - 1]` is `'?'` or `s[n - 2]` is `'?'` or `s[n - 1]` is equal to `s[n - 2]`, then `count` is 3.
     - Otherwise, `count` is 0.
   - Additionally, `count` is not equal to `j` (which is 1), but this condition is already covered by the first set of conditions since `count` can only be 0 or 3.

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - Based on the above, `count` can either be 0 or 3.
   - The `print` statement is `print(count * 2)`.
   - If `count` is 0, then `count * 2` is 0.
   - If `count` is 3, then `count * 2` is 6.

Given the conditions and the possible values of `count`, the output will be either 0 or 6.

However, without the exact values of `s[n - 1]` and `s[n - 2]`, we can't determine the exact value of `count`. Therefore, we can describe the output based on the possible values of `count`.

Output: **count * 2 (where count is 0 or 3 based on the conditions described)**

Since the problem asks for the most precise description possible, we can specify the possible outcomes:

Output: **0 or 6**
