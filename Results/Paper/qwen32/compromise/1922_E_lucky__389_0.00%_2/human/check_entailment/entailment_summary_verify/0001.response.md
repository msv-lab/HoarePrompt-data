### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its function summary to determine if it correctly solves the problem of finding an array with exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to find an array such that it has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
- An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements from the array that are strictly increasing and in the same order as they appear in the array.
- The array length should be at most 200.
- If no such array exists, we should output -1.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the integer `X`.
   - It then calls `func_1()` for each test case.

2. **Logic in `func_1()`:**
   - `x` is decremented by 1 to account for the empty subsequence.
   - The program attempts to decompose `x` into a sum of powers of 2 minus 1 (i.e., \( 2^i - 1 \)) to determine the lengths of increasing subsequences.
   - `subseq_lens` is a list that stores the indices `i` such that \( 2^i - 1 \) is part of the decomposition.
   - `mx` keeps track of the maximum length of subsequences found.
   - The array `ansv` is constructed based on `subseq_lens` and `mx`.

3. **Output Construction:**
   - The program prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv` as the array.

#### Issues in the Program:

- **Decomposition of `x`:** The program attempts to decompose `x` into a sum of powers of 2 minus 1 (\( 2^i - 1 \)). This approach is based on the idea that the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be related to the sum of these terms. However, the relationship between the decomposition and the number of increasing subsequences is not clearly established.
- **Array Construction:** The array `ansv` is constructed in a way that does not necessarily ensure that the number of increasing subsequences equals \( X \). The logic for constructing the array based on `subseq_lens` is flawed.
- **Edge Cases:** The program does not handle the case where it is impossible to construct such an array (i.e., when \( X \) cannot be represented as a sum of \( 2^i - 1 \) for valid `i` values).

#### Function Summary Analysis:
The function summary states that `func_1` processes a single test case where it receives an integer `X` such that \( 2 \leq X \leq 10^{18} \). It calculates a sequence of powers of 2 that sum up to \( X-1 \) and outputs the count of these powers minus one, followed by the sequence of powers of 2 (excluding the largest power of 2 used).

This summary does not provide a clear explanation of how the decomposition of \( X-1 \) into powers of 2 minus 1 relates to the number of increasing subsequences in the constructed array.

#### Conclusion:
Given the above points, the program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic for decomposing \( x \) and constructing the array based on that decomposition does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences. The relationship between the decomposition and the number of increasing subsequences is not well-established, and the program does not handle cases where it is impossible to construct such an array.

**Final: False**
