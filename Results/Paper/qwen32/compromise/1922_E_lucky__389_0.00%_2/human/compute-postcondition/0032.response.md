The code appends the value of `i` to the list `subseq_lens`. Given that `i` is 58, `subseq_lens` will now contain 58. The values of `t`, `X`, `x`, `mx`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18; `x` is at least 2^59 - 1; `subseq_lens` is [58]; `mx` is 0 or 59; `i` is 58 and not equal to 0.**
