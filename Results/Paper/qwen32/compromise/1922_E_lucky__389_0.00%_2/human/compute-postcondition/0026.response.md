To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

The loop condition is `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`. For the loop to execute again, this condition must be true.

Let's analyze the current state:
- `i` is 2.
- `x` is at least 3.

Given `i = 2`, the condition becomes `2 ** (2 + 1) <= x + 1`, which simplifies to `2 ** 3 <= x + 1` or `8 <= x + 1`. This further simplifies to `7 <= x`.

Since `x` is at least 3, we need to ensure that `x` is at least 7 to satisfy the condition for the loop to execute one more time.

No other states need to be adjusted because the loop condition only depends on `i` and `x`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18; `x` is at least 7; `subseq_lens` is an empty list or contains the integer 59; `mx` is 0 or 59; `i` is 2**
