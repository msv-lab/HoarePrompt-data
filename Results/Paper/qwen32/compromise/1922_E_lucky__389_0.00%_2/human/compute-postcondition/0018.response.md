The code snippet `mx = max(mx, i)` compares the current value of `mx` with `i` and assigns the larger of the two to `mx`. Given the initial state, `mx` is 0 and `i` is 59. Since 59 is greater than 0, `mx` will be updated to 59.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18; `x` is at least 1 minus \(2^{59} - 1\); `subseq_lens` is a list containing the integer 59; `mx` is 59; `i` is 59; `i` is not equal to 0.**
