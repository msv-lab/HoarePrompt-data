Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `pb` and `ps` are integers; `p` is a list of integers; `a` is a list of integers; `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`. If `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, `b` is `[-maxa, maxa]`, `s` is `[-maxa, maxa]`, `i` is `k`, `preb` is `[-maxa, 0]`, `pres` is `[-maxa]`, `sb` is `0`, `ss` is `-maxa`, `ptsb` is recalculated based on the new `preb` and `b`, `ptss` is recalculated based on the new `pres` and `s`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, recalculated if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, and `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, recalculated if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True. If `foundb` is True and `founds` is False, `b` is recalculated based on the new conditions, `s` is recalculated based on the new conditions with `maxa` appended, `i` is `k`, `preb` is recalculated based on the new `b`, `pres` is recalculated based on the new `s`, `sb` is recalculated based on the new `b`, `ss` is recalculated based on the new `s`, `ptsb` is recalculated based on the new `preb` and `b`, `ptss` is recalculated based on the new `pres` and `s`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, recalculated if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, and `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, recalculated if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True. If `foundb` and `founds` are both True, `b` is updated to `b + [-maxa]` and `s` is updated to `s + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa]`. If `foundb` and `founds` are not both True, the values of `b`, `i`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb` are recalculated based on the new `b` and `s` if `foundb` is True, otherwise they retain their previous values.**
