The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `pres`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 1`, which means it has reached the last element of `pres`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. However, since `i` is already at the last index of `pres`, the loop will not execute again because `i` will no longer be less than `len(pres)`.

Thus, the state does not need to be adjusted for another iteration since the loop will terminate after the current iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `b` and `s` are lists of length `k` with values determined by the loop conditions; `i` is `k - 1`; `preb` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `b` up to each index; `pres` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `s` up to each index; `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`; `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`; `ptsb` is a list containing `preb[k - 1]`; `ptss` is a list containing `pres[k - 1]`; `rem` is 0.**
