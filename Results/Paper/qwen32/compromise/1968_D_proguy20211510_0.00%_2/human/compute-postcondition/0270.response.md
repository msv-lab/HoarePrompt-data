The provided Python code snippet contains a single `print` statement that outputs the string `'Sasha'`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. Therefore, we can directly determine what will be printed without needing to evaluate the values of any variables.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('Sasha')`.
2. The string `'Sasha'` is explicitly provided as the argument to the `print` function.
3. No variables or conditions are involved in the `print` statement that would change the output.

Thus, the output of the code will simply be the string `'Sasha'`.

Output: **Sasha**
