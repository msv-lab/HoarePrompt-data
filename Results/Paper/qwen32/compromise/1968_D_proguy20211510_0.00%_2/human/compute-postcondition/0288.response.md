The code snippet provided appends the element `a[pb - 1]` to the list `b`. Given the initial state, `b` was an empty list, and `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa` (since `a[pb - 1]` is specified to be equal to `maxa`). Therefore, after the execution of the code, `b` will contain one element, which is `maxa`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b` (now an empty list), `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s` with at least `len(pres)` elements, `sb` is 0, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is a list containing the elements `preb[0] + (k-1) * b[0]`, `preb[1] + (k-2) * b[1]`, ..., `preb[len(pres)-1] + (k-len(pres)) * b[len(pres)-1]` (now an empty list), `ptss` is a list containing the elements `pres[0] + (k-1) * s[0]`, `pres[1] + (k-2) * s[1]`, ..., `pres[len(pres)-1] + (k-len(pres)) * s[len(pres)-1]`, `i` is `len(pres) - 1`, `rem` is `k - len(pres)`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is undefined since `ptsb` is empty, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` is a list containing the element `maxa`, `s` is an empty list, `founds` is True, `foundb` is True, and `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`.**
