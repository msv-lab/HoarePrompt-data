The code snippet `preb.append(sb + b[i])` appends the sum of `sb` and `b[i]` to the list `preb`. This means the list `preb` will have one more element than before, which is the result of adding `sb` to the `i`-th element of `b`.

Output State: **`b` and `s` are lists of length `k` populated based on the conditions, `foundb` and `founds` are booleans indicating if `maxa` was found, `preb` is a list with one additional element equal to `sb + b[i]`, `pres` is an empty list, `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0, `ptsb` and `ptss` are recalculated, `maxs` and `maxb` are maximum values in `ptss` and `ptsb`, `s` must have at least one element.**
