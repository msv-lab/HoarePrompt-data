The code snippet assigns the value of `k - (i + 1)` to the variable `rem`. Given that `i` is `k - 1`, we can substitute `i` with `k - 1` in the expression `k - (i + 1)`, which results in `k - ((k - 1) + 1)`. Simplifying this expression, we get `k - k`, which equals `0`. Therefore, `rem` is assigned the value `0`.

The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k` must be at least 1, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `b` and `s` are lists of length `k` with values determined by the loop conditions; `i` is `k - 1`; `preb` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `b` up to each index; `pres` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `s` up to each index; `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`; `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`; `ptsb` and `ptss` are empty lists; `rem` is 0.**
