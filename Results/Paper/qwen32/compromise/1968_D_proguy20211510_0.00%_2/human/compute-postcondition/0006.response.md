The code reads a line of input, splits it into strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `p`. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers obtained by converting the previously split input strings to integers; `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the newly split input strings to integers.**
