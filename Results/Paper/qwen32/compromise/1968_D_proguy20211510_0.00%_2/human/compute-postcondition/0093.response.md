The code snippet initializes two variables `sb` and `ss` to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `b` and `s` are lists of length `k` with values determined by the loop conditions; `i` is `k - 1`; `preb` is an empty list; `pres` is an empty list; `sb` is 0; `ss` is 0.**
