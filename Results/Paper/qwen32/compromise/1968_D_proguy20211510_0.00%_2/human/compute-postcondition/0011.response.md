Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers obtained by converting the previously split input strings to integers; `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the newly split input strings to integers; `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the newly split input strings to integers; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`. The value at index `pb - 1` in the list `a` is equal to the value at index `ps - 1` in the list `a`, and both are equal to `maxa`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply moves to the next iteration of the loop if it is inside a loop. Since there is no loop or any other change in the given code snippet, all the variables retain their initial values.
