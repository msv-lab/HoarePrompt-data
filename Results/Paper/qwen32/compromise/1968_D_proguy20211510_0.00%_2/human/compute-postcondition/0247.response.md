Output State: **`preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s` that must have at least 2 elements, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is a list containing the elements `preb[0] + rem * b[0]`, `preb[1] + rem * b[1]`, and `preb[2] + rem * b[2]`, `ptss` is a list containing the elements `pres[0] + rem * s[0]` and `pres[1] + rem * s[1]`, `i` is 2, `rem` is `k - 3`.**

Explanation: The value of `ptsb` has been updated to include an additional element, which is `preb[2] + rem * b[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
