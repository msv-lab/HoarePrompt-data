Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `pb` and `ps` are integers; `p` is a list of integers; `a` is a list of integers; `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`. If `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, then `founds` is True and `s` is `[-maxa, maxa]` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise `s` is the previous elements of `s` plus `maxa`. If `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, then `founds` is False and `s` is `[-maxa, a[ps - 1]]` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise `s` is the previous elements of `s` plus `a[ps - 1]`. The values of `b`, `i`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb` are recalculated based on the new `b` and `s` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise they are recalculated based on the new `b` and `s` if `foundb` is True, otherwise they retain their previous values.**
