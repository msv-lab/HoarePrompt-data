The code snippet `ptsb.append(preb[i] + rem * b[i])` appends a new value to the list `ptsb`. The new value is calculated as `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is `k - 1`, so the value being appended is `preb[k - 1] + rem * b[k - 1]`. Since `rem` is 0, the value being appended simplifies to `preb[k - 1]`, which is already the last element of `ptsb`. Therefore, the list `ptsb` will now have a duplicate of its last element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `b` and `s` are lists of length `k` with values determined by the loop conditions; `i` is `k - 1`; `preb` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `b` up to each index; `pres` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `s` up to each index; `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`; `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`; `ptsb` is a list containing `preb[k - 1], preb[k - 1]`; `ptss` is a list containing `pres[k - 1]`; `rem` is 0.**
