Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds` are as given; `k` is greater than 0; `i` is 0. If `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa`, then `foundb` is true and `b` includes `maxa` as its last element. Otherwise, `foundb` is false, `b` includes the element `a[pb - 1]` at the end, and `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`. If `founds` is true, then `s` includes an additional element `(k - 1) * maxa`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `b` or `s`.**
