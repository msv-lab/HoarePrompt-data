Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `b` and `s` are lists of length `k` with values determined by the loop conditions; `i` is `k - 1`; `preb` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `b` up to each index, i.e., `preb = [b[0], b[0] + b[1], ..., b[0] + b[1] + ... + b[k-1]]`; `pres` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `s` up to each index, i.e., `pres = [s[0], s[0] + s[1], ..., s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[k-1]]`; `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, i.e., `sb = b[0] + b[1] + ... + b[k-1]`; `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, i.e., `ss = s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[k-1]`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `preb` will contain the cumulative sums of the elements in `b` up to each index, `pres` will contain the cumulative sums of the elements in `s` up to each index, `sb` will be the total sum of all elements in `b`, and `ss` will be the total sum of all elements in `s`. The variable `i` will be equal to `k - 1`, indicating that the loop has iterated through all elements in the lists `b` and `s`.
