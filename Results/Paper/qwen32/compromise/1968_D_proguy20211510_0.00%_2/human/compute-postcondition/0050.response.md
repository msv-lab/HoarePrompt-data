The code snippet `ps = p[ps - 1]` updates the value of `ps` to the value found at the index `ps - 1` in the list `p`. 

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `ps`. The other variables remain as they were described in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `k` is greater than 0; `i` is 0. `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`. If `foundb` is true, `b` includes an additional element `maxa`. If `foundb` is false, `b` includes the element `a[pb - 1]` at the end, and `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`. `founds` is false, so `s` does not include an additional element `(k - 1) * maxa`. `s` now includes the element `a[ps - 1]` at the end. `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`.**
