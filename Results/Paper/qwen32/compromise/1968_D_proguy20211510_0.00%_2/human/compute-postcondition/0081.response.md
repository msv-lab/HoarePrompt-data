Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `k` must be greater than 0; `i` is 2; `b` includes an additional element `a[pb - 1]`. If `foundb` and `founds` are true, `s` includes an additional element `(k - 3) * maxa` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the conditions related to `foundb` and `founds` and the updates to `b`, `s`, `pb`, and `ps` remain as described in the precondition. `pb` is now `p[pb - 1]`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial state.
