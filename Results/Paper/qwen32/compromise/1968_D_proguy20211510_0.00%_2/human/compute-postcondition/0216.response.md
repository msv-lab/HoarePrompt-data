Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `pb` and `ps` are integers; `p` is a list of integers; `a` is a list of integers; `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`; `founds` is a boolean; `foundb` is a boolean; `b` is a list of integers; `s` is a list of integers. If `founds` is True, `s` has an additional element `maxa` appended; otherwise, `s` has an additional element `a[ps - 1]` appended. If `a[ps - 1] == maxa` and `founds` is True, `founds` remains True; otherwise, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`. The values of `b`, `i`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb` retain their previous values unless `founds` is True, in which case `s` is updated as described.**
