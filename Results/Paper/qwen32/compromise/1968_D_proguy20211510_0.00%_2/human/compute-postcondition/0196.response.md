Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `pb` and `ps` are integers; `p` is a list of integers; `a` is a list of integers; `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`. If `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `founds` is set to True, and `s` includes the element `a[ps - 1]`. If `foundb` is True, `b`, `i`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb` are recalculated based on the new `founds` value. If `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, `founds` remains unchanged, and `ps` is set to `p[ps - 1]`. The values of `b`, `i`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb` retain their previous values if `foundb` is False. If `foundb` is True, these values are recalculated based on the new conditions.**
