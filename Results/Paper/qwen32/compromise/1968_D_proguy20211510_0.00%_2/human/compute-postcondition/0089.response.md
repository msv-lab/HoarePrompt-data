Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `k` must be greater than 0; `i` is 2. If `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, then `founds` is True and `s` includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]`. Otherwise, `s` includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]` and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`. The conditions related to `foundb` and the updates to `b` and `pb` remain as described in the precondition.**
