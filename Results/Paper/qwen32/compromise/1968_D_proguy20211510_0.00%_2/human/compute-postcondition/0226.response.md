The code appends `sb + b[i]` to the list `preb`. The value of `i` has already been incremented by 1, so the value of `b[i]` refers to the next character in the string `b` after the previous `b[i]`.

Output State: **`pres` is a list with an additional element `ss + s[i]`, `ss` is a string with the additional character `s[i]`, `s` is a string, `i` is `i + 1`, `preb` is a list with an additional element `sb + b[i]`.**
In simpler terms, `pres` has an extra element that is the concatenation of `ss` and the character `s[i]`. `ss` has an extra character `s[i]`. `s` remains unchanged. `i` has been incremented by 1. `preb` has an extra element that is the concatenation of `sb` and the character `b[i]`.
