Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `pb` and `ps` are integers; `p` is a list of integers; `a` is a list of integers; `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`. If `founds` is True, then `b` is `[-maxa, maxa]` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise `b` is recalculated based on the new conditions; `s` is `[-maxa, maxa]` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise `s` is recalculated based on the new conditions with `maxa` appended; `i` is `k`; `preb` is `[-maxa, 0]` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise `preb` is recalculated based on the new `b`; `pres` is `[-maxa]` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise `pres` is recalculated based on the new `s`; `sb` is `0` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise `sb` is recalculated based on the new `b`; `ss` is `-maxa` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise `ss` is recalculated based on the new `s`; `ptsb` is recalculated based on the new `preb` and `b`; `ptss` is recalculated based on the new `pres` and `s`; `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, recalculated if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True; `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, recalculated if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True. If `founds` is False, then if `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `founds` becomes True and `s` is `[-maxa, maxa]` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise `s` is the previous elements of `s` plus `maxa`. If `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, `founds` remains False and `s` is `[-maxa, a[ps - 1]]` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise `s` is the previous elements of `s` plus `a[ps - 1]`. The values of `b`, `i`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb` are recalculated based on the new `b` and `s` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise they are recalculated based on the new `b` and `s` if `foundb` is True, otherwise they retain their previous values. `b` is now `b + [-maxa]`. `s` is now `s + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa]`.** 

In natural language: The variable `s` has been updated to include an additional element, which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. All other variables retain their previous values unless they are recalculated based on the new `s` and `b` as described in the initial state conditions.
