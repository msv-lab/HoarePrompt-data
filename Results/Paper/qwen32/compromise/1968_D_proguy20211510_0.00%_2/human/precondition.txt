t is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^4). test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: (n, k, P_B, P_S) and two lists p and a. n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 2*10^5), k is a positive integer (1 <= k <= 10^9), P_B and P_S are integers (1 <= P_B, P_S <= n). p is a list of n integers (1 <= p_i <= n), representing the permutation. a is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), representing the array a. The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5.
