The code snippet provided resets the value of `first_row` to an empty string. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, or `last_row`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer read from the new input; `m` is the second integer read from the new input; `a` is an empty list; `first_row` is an empty string; `last_row` is a string containing the last character of each of the `n` input strings concatenated together.**
