Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer greater than 0; `m` is an integer read from input; `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being a string input from the user; `first_row` is a string containing the first character of each string in `a` concatenated together; `last_row` is a string containing the last character of each string in `a` concatenated together; `i` is `n`.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains an integer within the given range, `n` is the total number of iterations (and hence the number of strings read), `m` is unchanged from its initial value, `a` contains all the strings that were input during the loop, `first_row` is a string made up of the first characters of each input string, `last_row` is a string made up of the last characters of each input string, and the loop variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
