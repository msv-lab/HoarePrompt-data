The code snippet provided initializes an empty list `a`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `m`, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state except for the new variable `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `a` is an empty list.**
