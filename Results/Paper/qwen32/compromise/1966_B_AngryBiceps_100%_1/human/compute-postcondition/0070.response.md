The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the third string in the list `a` to the `last_row` variable. 

Given the initial state, `last_row` is initially the concatenation of the last character of the original string and the last character of the second string. After executing the code, `last_row` will be updated to include the last character of the third string as well.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer greater than 0; `m` is an integer read from input; `a` is a list containing three elements, the first being the original string input from the user, the second being a new string input from the user, and the third being the newly appended string; `first_row` is the first character of the original string in `a` concatenated with the first character of the second string in `a` and the first character of the third string in `a`; `last_row` is the last character of the original string in `a` concatenated with the last character of the second string in `a` and the last character of the third string in `a`; `i` is `t + 1`.**
