The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last element in the list `a` to the string `first_row`. Given that `a` is a list containing one element which is a string input from the user, `a[-1]` refers to that single string element. Therefore, `a[-1][0]` is the first character of that string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the new input, `a` is a list containing one element which is the string input from the user, `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a`, `last_row` is an empty string**.
