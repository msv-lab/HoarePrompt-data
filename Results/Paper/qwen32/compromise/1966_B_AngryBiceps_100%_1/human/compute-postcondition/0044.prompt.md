Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer read from the new input; `m` is the second integer read from the new input; `a` is an empty list; `first_row` is an empty string; `last_row` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a.append(input())
    first_row += a[-1][0]
    last_row += a[-1][-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the new input, `a` is a list containing one element which is the string input from the user, `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the new input, `a` is a list containing two elements (the original string and the newly appended string), `first_row` is the first character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the first character of the last string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the last string in `a` repeated twice, `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the new input, `a` is a list containing three elements (the original string, the newly appended string, and the newest string), `first_row` is the first character of the original string concatenated with the first character of the newest string twice, `last_row` is the last character of the newest string repeated three times, `i` is `i + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
