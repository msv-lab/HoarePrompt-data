The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` modifies the `first_row` variable by appending the first character of the last string in the list `a` to it.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer greater than 0
- `m` is an integer read from input
- `a` is a list containing two elements, the first being the original string input from the user and the second being a new string input from the user
- `first_row` is the first character of the original string in `a`
- `last_row` is the last character of the original string in `a`

After executing the code, `first_row` is updated to be the concatenation of its original value and the first character of the second string in the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer greater than 0; `m` is an integer read from input; `a` is a list containing two elements, the first being the original string input from the user and the second being a new string input from the user; `first_row` is the first character of the original string in `a` concatenated with the first character of the second string in `a`; `last_row` is the last character of the original string in `a`.**
