The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the newest string in the list `a` to `last_row`. Given that `last_row` was initially the last character of the newest string repeated twice, after this operation, `last_row` will be the last character of the newest string repeated three times.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the new input, `a` is a list containing three elements (the original string, the newly appended string, and the newest string), `first_row` is the first character of the original string concatenated with the first character of the newest string twice, `last_row` is the last character of the newest string repeated three times, `i` is `i + 1`.**
