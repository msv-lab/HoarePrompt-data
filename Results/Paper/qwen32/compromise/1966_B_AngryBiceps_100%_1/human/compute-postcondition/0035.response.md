The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last element in the list `a` to the string `last_row`. Given that `a` is a list containing one element which is the string input from the user, `a[-1]` refers to this string. Therefore, `a[-1][-1]` is the last character of that string.

Since `last_row` was initially an empty string, after this operation, `last_row` will contain the last character of the string in `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the new input, `a` is a list containing one element which is the string input from the user, `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a`**.
