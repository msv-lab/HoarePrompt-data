Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's analyze the situation step by step:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). However, `t` does not affect the print statement directly.
- `n` is greater than 0, indicating that there is at least one string in the list `a`.
- `m` is the second integer read from the input, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `a` is a list containing `n` elements, where each element is a string.
- `first_row` is a string formed by concatenating the first character of each string in `a`.
- `last_row` is a string formed by concatenating the last character of each string in `a`.
- Additional conditions are provided about the strings in `a` and the characters in `first_row` and `last_row`, but these do not affect the print statement directly.
- The print statement is `print('NO')`.

The print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, or `last_row`. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Thus, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **NO**
