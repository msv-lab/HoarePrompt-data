The given code snippet updates the values of `n` and `m` by reading a new pair of integers from the input. The initial state specifies that `n` is greater than 0 and `m` is an integer read from the input, but these values are overwritten by the new input values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer read from the new input; `m` is the second integer read from the new input; `a` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is an input string); `first_row` is a string containing the first character of each of the `n` input strings concatenated together; `last_row` is a string containing the last character of each of the `n` input strings concatenated together.**
