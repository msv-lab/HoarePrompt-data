Reasoning:
The given program attempts to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing the specified operations. The program checks two conditions:
1. If the first and last rows of the grid are identical and not the same.
2. If the first and last columns of the grid are identical and not the same.

If either of these conditions is true, the program outputs "NO", indicating that it's not possible to make all squares the same color. Otherwise, it outputs "YES".

The logic behind this is that if the first and last rows or columns are identical and not the same, there will be a boundary between these rows or columns that cannot be filled with the same color using the given operations. This is because the operations can only fill a subrectangle with the same color if the selected squares are already of that color. If the first and last rows or columns are different, there will be a part of the grid that cannot be unified with the rest of the grid under the given constraints.

The provided test cases align with this logic:
- For the first test case, the first and last rows are different, so the output is "NO".
- For the second test case, it's possible to make all squares the same color, so the output is "YES".
- For the third and fourth test cases, all squares are already the same color, so the output is "YES".
- For the fifth test case, it's possible to make all squares the same color with two operations, so the output is "YES".
- For the sixth test case, the first and last rows are different, so the output is "NO".
- For the seventh and eighth test cases, it's possible to make all squares the same color, so the output is "YES".

Given the provided logic and test cases, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
