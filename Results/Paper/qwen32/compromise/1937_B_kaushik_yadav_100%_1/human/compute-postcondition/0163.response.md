The `break` statement will terminate the innermost loop or switch construct it is in, but since there is no loop or switch construct provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not affect any of the variables. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the first character of `b`, `i` is 0, `work` is True, and `i + 1` equals the length of `a`**.
