Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is less than the length of `a` and `i` has been incremented by 1, `work` is a boolean value, `ans` is the original `ans` string concatenated with `b[i-1]`.**

In natural language: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged except that `ans` now includes the character from `b` at the index `i-1` (the previous position of `i`).
