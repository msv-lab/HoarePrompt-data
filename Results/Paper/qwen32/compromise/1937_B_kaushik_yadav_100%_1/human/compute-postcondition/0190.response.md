Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the stripped input string, `i` must be less than `len(a)`, `ans` is updated to include `a[i]`. If `i + 1` is less than `len(a)` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` is set to `False`. Otherwise, if `i + 1` equals `len(a)`, the loop or if statement breaks after updating `ans` to include `b[i]`. If `i + 1` is less than `len(a)` and `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`, then `i` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is updated to include `a[i]`.**
