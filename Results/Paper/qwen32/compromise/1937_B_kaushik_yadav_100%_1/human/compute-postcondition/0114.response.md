Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is the input integer; `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `b` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `i` is less than the length of `a`; `ans` is updated to include `a[i]` and `b[i]`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `ans` remain the same as in the initial state, except that we have exited the most internal loop or if statement.
