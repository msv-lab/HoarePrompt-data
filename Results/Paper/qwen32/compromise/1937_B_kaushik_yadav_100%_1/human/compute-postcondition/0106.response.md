Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is the input integer; `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `b` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `i` is less than the length of `a`. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` is set to False. Otherwise, if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `ans` includes the characters `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `ans` includes the character `a[i]`. `work` is a boolean that can be True or False, and `j` and `counter` maintain their respective states as described in the precondition.**
