Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is the input integer; `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `b` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `i` is less than the length of `a`; `work` is a boolean that can be True or False; `ans` is a string that is being constructed and now includes the characters `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `j` and `counter` maintain their respective states as described in the precondition; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `work`, `j`, and `counter` remain unchanged. The only change is that the program execution will exit the most internal loop or if statement.
