The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `len(a)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `len(a)`, but we need to ensure that `i` is still less than `len(a)` for the next iteration.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 in certain conditions, we need to make sure that `i` is still within the bounds of the string `a` for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to a value that is still less than `len(a)`.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the stripped input string, `i` must be less than `len(a)`**
