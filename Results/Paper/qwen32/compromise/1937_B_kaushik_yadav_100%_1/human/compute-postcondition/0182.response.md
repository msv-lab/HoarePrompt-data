Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the stripped input string, `i` is less than `len(a)`. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, `work` is `False`. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, `ans` is updated to include both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and the loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to include `a[i]`, and `i` is increased by 1. If `work` is not `False`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated to include `b[i - 1]`.**
