The code assigns the input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace to the variable `a`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is an input integer; `a` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**
