Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is less than the length of `a` and `i` has been incremented by 1, `ans` includes the character `a[i]` appended to it, `work` is set to `False` if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `work` remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms, the value of `i` has been increased by 1. The variable `ans` has the character `a[i]` appended to it. The variable `work` is set to `False` under specific conditions related to the values of `i`, `a`, and `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
