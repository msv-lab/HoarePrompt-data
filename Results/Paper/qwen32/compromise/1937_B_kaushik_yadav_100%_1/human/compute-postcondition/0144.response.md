Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases), `n` is the input integer, `a` is a string with at least 2 characters, `b` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is the final constructed string based on the conditions described, `i` equals the length of `a`, `work` is True or False depending on the last iteration, `j` is `len(a) - 1`. If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', then `counter` is set to 1. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
