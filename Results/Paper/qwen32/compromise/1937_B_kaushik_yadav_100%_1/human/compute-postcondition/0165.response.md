Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is the first character of `a`, `i` is 1, `work` is True, and `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`**

Natural language: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged, including `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, and `work`. The precondition that `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]` still holds true.
