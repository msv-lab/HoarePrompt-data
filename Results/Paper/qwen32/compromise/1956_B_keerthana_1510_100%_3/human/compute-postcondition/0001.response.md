To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and how it processes the input.

### Code Analysis:
1. The loop iterates over every second line starting from the third line (`[2::2]`) of the input, which means it processes the lines containing the sequences of integers (the card numbers).
2. For each line, it splits the line into tokens (which are the integers in string form).
3. It calculates the difference between the total number of tokens and the number of unique tokens. This difference represents the count of integers that appear more than once in the sequence.
4. It prints this difference for each line.

### Input Format:
- The first line contains an integer `n`, the number of cards each player receives.
- The following line contains `n` integers, each integer from 1 to `n` appearing at most 2 times.

### Output State:
The output will be a series of integers, each representing the count of integers that appear more than once in each sequence of integers provided in the input.

### Example:
If the input is:
```
3
1 2 3
4
1 2 2 3
5
1 1 2 3 4
```
The loop will process the lines:
- `1 2 3` (no duplicates, so the output is `0`)
- `1 2 2 3` (one duplicate `2`, so the output is `1`)
- `1 1 2 3 4` (one duplicate `1`, so the output is `1`)

Thus, the output will be:
```
0
1
1
```

### Output State:
The output state will be a series of integers, each printed on a new line, representing the count of duplicates in each sequence of integers from the input.

Output State: **a series of integers, each representing the count of integers that appear more than once in each sequence of integers from the input.**
