t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of cards each player receives, and a list a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the integers on the cards in your hand. Each integer from 1 through n appears in the list a at most 2 times. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
