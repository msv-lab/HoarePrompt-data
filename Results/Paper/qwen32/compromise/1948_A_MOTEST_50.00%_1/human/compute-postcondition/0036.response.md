Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, and `s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. If `n` is 1, the state remains unchanged. If `n` is even and not equal to 1, `ans` is 'AABBCCDDEEFFGGHHIIJJKKLLMMNNOOPPQQRRSSTTUUVVWWXXYYZZ' and `x` is 25. If `n` is odd and not equal to 1, `ans` is 'AAABBBCCDD' and `x` is 4, and `j` is 2.**
