The code snippet `n = int(input())` changes the value of `n` to whatever integer is input by the user. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', and `i` is `i + 1`.**

Natural language: The value of `n` has been updated to the integer provided by the user input. The values of `t`, `s`, and `i` remain as specified in the initial state.
