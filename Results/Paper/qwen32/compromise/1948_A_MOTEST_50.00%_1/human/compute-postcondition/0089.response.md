The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` updates the value of `ans` by adding twice the value of `s[x]` to it. The values of `n`, `j`, `t`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged, while `x` and `ans` are affected.

Output State: **`n` is at least 5, `j` is 1, `t`, `i`, `s` are not in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, `x` remains unchanged, `ans` is updated to `ans + s[x] * 2`.**
