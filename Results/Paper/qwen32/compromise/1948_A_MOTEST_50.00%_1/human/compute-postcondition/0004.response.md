The code snippet `n = int(input())` will change the value of `n` to the integer value provided by the user input. The precondition that `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50 will still hold true if the user inputs a value within this range. The values of `t` and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'**.
