Postcondition: **`t` is greater than `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer (either 6 or 7), `s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is either 'AABBCC' or 'AAABBCCDD', and `x` is either 3 or 4. If `n` is 6, `ans` is 'AABBCC' and `x` is 3. If `n` is 7, `ans` is 'AAABBCCDD' and `x` is 4.**
