The code `b[x] += 1` increments the value at index `x` of the list `b` by 1. Given that `x` is initialized to 0, the value at index 0 of the list `b` will be incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t + 1`, `b` is a list of 26 zeros except `b[0]` which is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers and must contain at least one element, `r` is `a[0]`, `x` is 0, `i` is the last element in the new `s`**.
