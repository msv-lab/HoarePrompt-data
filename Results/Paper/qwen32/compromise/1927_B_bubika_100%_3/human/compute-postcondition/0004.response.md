The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and then converts each string in the list to an integer, storing the result in the variable `s`. The variables `t`, `b`, and `n` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `b` is a list of 26 zeros; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers.**
