Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `b` is a list where the first element is 2 and the remaining 25 elements are 0; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers and must have at least 1 element; `r` is the string representation of `s[0]` concatenated with `a[0]`; `x` is 0; `i` is `s[1]`.**

In this output state, the value of the first element in list `b` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
