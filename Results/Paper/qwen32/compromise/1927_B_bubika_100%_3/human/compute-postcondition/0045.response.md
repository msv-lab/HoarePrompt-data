The code snippet `x = b.index(i)` attempts to find the index of the element `i` in the list `b`. However, the initial state provided does not mention the variable `b` or `i`. Assuming that `b` is a list of integers (since `s` is described similarly), and `i` is an integer that exists in `b`, the code will assign the index of `i` in `b` to the variable `x`.

Given that the initial state only specifies `s` and does not provide information about `b` or `i`, we will assume `b` is another list of integers and `i` is an integer present in `b`. The state of `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a new list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers and must have at least 1 element; `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`.**
