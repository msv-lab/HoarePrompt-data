The code snippet `x = b.index(i)` searches for the index of the value `i` in the list `b`. Given that `b` is a list where the first element is 1 and the remaining 25 elements are 0, the value of `x` will be 0 if `i` is 1, and it will raise a `ValueError` if `i` is any other value since `i` must be present in the list `b` for `index()` to return a valid index.

Since `i` is specified as `s[1]`, and `s` is a list of integers obtained from the space-separated input values, the value of `i` is determined by the input. However, based on the precondition that `b` only contains a 1 as its first element, `i` must be 1 for `x` to be assigned a value of 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `b` is a list where the first element is 1 and the remaining 25 elements are 0; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers and must have at least 1 element; `r` is the string representation of `s[0]`; `x` is 0 if `s[1]` is 1, otherwise a `ValueError` is raised; `i` is `s[1]`**.
