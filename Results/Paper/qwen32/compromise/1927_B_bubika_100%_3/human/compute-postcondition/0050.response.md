The code snippet `r += a[x]` updates the value of `r` by adding the value of `a[x]` to it. The other variables (`s`, `x`, `b`, `i`) are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`s` is a new list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers and must have at least 2 elements; `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`; `r` is updated to its current value plus `a[x]`; `b[x]` is increased by 1; `i` is the next element in the list `s`.** 

In natural language: The list `s` remains unchanged, `x` remains the index of `i` in the list `b`, `r` is now its previous value plus `a[x]`, `b[x]` remains increased by 1, and `i` remains the next element in the list `s`.
