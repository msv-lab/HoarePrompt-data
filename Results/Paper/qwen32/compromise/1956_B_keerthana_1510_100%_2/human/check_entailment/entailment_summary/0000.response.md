Reasoning:  
The given program is not correct based on the problem description. The task is to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally, considering that Nene also plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score. The provided program, however, simply counts the number of integers that appear more than once in your hand, which does not account for the strategic play of the game.

The correct approach should involve simulating the game considering the optimal moves of both players. The program should take into account that Nene will play to maximize her score and minimize yours, which means it needs to simulate the game process and keep track of the cards on the table and the points scored by each player.

The current program's logic does not simulate the game or consider the strategic aspects of the game, so it does not solve the problem as intended.

Correctness: **False**
