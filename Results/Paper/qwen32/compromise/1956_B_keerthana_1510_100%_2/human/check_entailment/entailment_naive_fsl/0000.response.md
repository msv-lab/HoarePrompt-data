Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally. Instead, it simply calculates the difference between the total number of cards you have and the number of unique cards in your hand. This approach does not account for the strategic play by Nene to maximize her score and minimize yours.

Let's consider a counterexample:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  2
  1 1
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  0
  ```
- Program Output:
  ```
  1
  ```

Explanation of the counterexample:
- You have two cards, both with the number 1.
- Nene also has two cards, both with the number 1.
- In the first round, you play your card with the number 1. You do not get a point because there is no card with the number 1 on the table yet.
- In the second round, Nene plays her card with the number 1. She does not get a point because there is only one card with the number 1 on the table.
- In the third round, you play your remaining card with the number 1. You get a point because there is already a card with the number 1 on the table.
- In the fourth round, Nene plays her remaining card with the number 1. She gets a point because there is already a card with the number 1 on the table.
- The final score is 1 point for you and 1 point for Nene. However, the program incorrectly outputs 1, suggesting that you can get 1 point, which is not optimal given Nene's strategy to minimize your score.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly simulate the optimal play by both players as described in the problem statement.
