The code snippet provided only initializes a variable `flag` to `True`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`) are modified by this code. Therefore, the output state will reflect this initialization.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers read from input; `flag` is True.**
