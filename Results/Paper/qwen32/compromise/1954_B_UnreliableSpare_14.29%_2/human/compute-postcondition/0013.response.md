To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the variables involved:

1. **t**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable represents the number of test cases but is not directly used in the provided code snippet.
2. **n**: An input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\). This represents the length of the list `arr`.
3. **a**: A list of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\). This list is not directly used in the provided code snippet.
4. **arr**: A list of integers read from the input. This list is the primary focus of the provided code snippet.
5. **flag**: A boolean variable initialized to `False`, indicating that not all elements in `arr` are the same.
6. **ans**: The minimum length of consecutive identical elements in `arr`.
7. **val**: The last unique element counted in the loop.
8. **cnt**: The length of the last sequence of identical elements in `arr`.

The provided code snippet only contains a `print(ans)` statement. To determine the value of `ans`, we need to understand how `ans` is calculated based on the list `arr`.

The variable `ans` is described as the minimum length of consecutive identical elements in the list `arr`. This means that the code iterates through the list `arr`, counts the length of consecutive identical elements, and keeps track of the minimum such length.

Since `ans` is the minimum length of consecutive identical elements in `arr`, the printed value will be the smallest number of consecutive identical elements found in the list `arr`.

Given the initial state, we don't have the exact list `arr`, but we can describe the value of `ans` based on the structure of the problem.

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum length of consecutive identical elements in arr)**
