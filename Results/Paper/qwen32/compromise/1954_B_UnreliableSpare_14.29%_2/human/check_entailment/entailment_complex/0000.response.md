### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a given beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. The program iterates through each test case and processes the array accordingly.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:
1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Input**: For each test case, it reads the integer `n` (length of the array) and the array `arr` itself.
3. **Checking Uniformity**: It initializes a flag `flag` to `True` and checks if all elements in the array are the same. If any two consecutive elements are different, it sets `flag` to `False`.
4. **Finding Minimum Consecutive Sequence**: It initializes `ans` to infinity (`Decimal('Infinity')`), `val` to the first element of the array, and `cnt` to 0. It then iterates through the array, counting consecutive identical elements. When it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` with the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.
5. **Final Update**: After the loop, it performs a final update of `ans` with the minimum of its current value and `cnt` to account for the last sequence of identical elements.
6. **Output**: If `flag` is `True` (all elements are the same), it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the value of `ans`.

### Analysis of Correctness:
- **Uniform Array**: If all elements are the same (`flag` is `True`), the program correctly outputs `-1` as the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing any elements.
- **Non-uniform Array**: The program correctly calculates the minimum length of consecutive identical elements. Removing any element from such a sequence would break the beautiful property of the array. Thus, the program outputs the correct minimum number of elements to remove.

The program handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem statement and adheres to the constraints provided.

### Conclusion:
The program is correctly implementing the logic required to solve the problem as described.

### Correctness: **True**
