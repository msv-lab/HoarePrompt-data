Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful is flawed.

Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

1. **Flag Check for Uniform Array**: The code correctly checks if the array is uniform (all elements are the same) and returns `-1` if it is. This part is correct.

2. **Counting Minimum Removals**:
   - The code attempts to count the minimum number of elements to remove by iterating through the array and updating the count when it encounters a different element.
   - However, the logic for updating the `ans` variable (which stores the minimum count of consecutive elements to remove) is incorrect. The `ans` variable is updated using the `min` function, but it does not correctly account for the need to break up the sequence of identical elements to make the array non-beautiful.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails

Consider the following input:
```
1
6
1 2 1 2 1 2
```

The correct output should be `1`, because we can remove any one element from the sequence to make it non-beautiful. For example, removing the second element results in `[1, 1, 2, 1, 2]`, which is not beautiful.

However, the provided program will output `2` for this input. Here's why:

- The program identifies that the array is not uniform.
- It then counts the lengths of consecutive elements and updates `ans` with the minimum length of such sequences.
- In this case, the program will set `ans` to `2` because the minimum length of consecutive identical elements is `2` (e.g., the sequence `1 1` or `2 2`).

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:

1. Check if the array is uniform and return `-1` if it is.
2. Otherwise, iterate through the array and count the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the sequence of identical elements in such a way that the resulting array is not beautiful.

Given the complexity of correctly implementing this logic, it is clear that the provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
