### Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem using dynamic programming (DP). However, the DP approach implemented in the function `func_1()` does not correctly reflect the optimal strategy for the game as described in the problem statement. 

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect DP Table Initialization and Update**:
   - The DP table `dp` is initialized with dimensions `(n+1) x (n+1)`, but the logic for updating the table does not seem to correctly represent the game's dynamics.
   - The base cases `dp[n-1][0]` and `dp[n-2][0]` are set to `0`, but the subsequent updates do not correctly consider the game rules. Specifically, the DP table is not correctly capturing the state transitions for the game where players take turns and receive points based on the cards on the table.

2. **Counting Cards**:
   - The program uses `cards.count(j + 1)` inside the nested loops, which is inefficient and incorrect for this context. The `count()` method has a time complexity of O(n), making the overall complexity of the nested loops O(n^3), which is infeasible given the constraints (n up to 2 * 10^5).

3. **Strategy for Nene**:
   - The problem specifies that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score. The provided DP approach does not correctly model Nene's optimal strategy. The DP table should consider the choices available to both players and the points they can gain or lose based on those choices.

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - A more appropriate strategy involves understanding that you should aim to play cards that are likely to be played by Nene in the future, and Nene should aim to play cards that maximize her points while minimizing yours. This can be achieved through a greedy approach or a more sophisticated DP that considers the choices of both players in a more structured way.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The DP approach used is not suitable for the problem constraints and does not correctly model the optimal strategies for both players.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
