The code snippet `dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]` updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to be equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. This means the value at position `[i][j]` in the 2D list `dp` is now the same as the value at position `[i + 1][j]`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where `dp[i][j]` has been updated to `dp[i + 1][j]`, and `j` is incremented by 1 from its current value.**
