The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop decrements `j` by 1 in each iteration, and it runs as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is decremented by 1 from its current value. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 to its previous value.

State: **`n` must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, and `j` is incremented by 1 from its current value.**
