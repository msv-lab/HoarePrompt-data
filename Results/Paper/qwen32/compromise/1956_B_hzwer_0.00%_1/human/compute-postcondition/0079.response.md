Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a sequence of `n` integers. The function processes these inputs to compute and return the final value stored in the `dp` table at position `[0][0]` after performing all necessary iterations and updates.**
