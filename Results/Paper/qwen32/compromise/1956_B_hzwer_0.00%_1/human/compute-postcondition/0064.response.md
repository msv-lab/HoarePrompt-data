The only object in the loop head is the variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates from `j = n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be decremented by 1.

State: **The `dp` table is fully updated after `n` iterations of the loop, with each `dp[i][j]` value calculated based on the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list and the rules provided in the loop body. `i` is 1, `j` is `n - 2`. If the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is 0, `dp[1][n - 2]` is equal to `dp[2][n - 2]`. If the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is exactly 1, `dp[1][n - 2]` is updated to `max(dp[2][n - 2], dp[3][n - 3] + 1)`. If the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is greater than 1, `dp[1][n - 2]` is recalculated to be `max(dp[2][n - 2], dp[3][n - 3] + 1, dp[2][n - 3] + 1, dp[2][n - 2])`.**
