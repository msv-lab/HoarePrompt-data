Postcondition: **`dp` table is fully updated after `n` iterations of the loop, with each `dp[i][j]` value calculated based on the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list and the rules provided in the loop body. The initial values of `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` remain `0`, and all other elements of `dp` are updated according to the loop logic. `i` is `n - 3`, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is `n - 1`. The count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is greater than 1.**
