Postcondition: **The `dp` table is fully updated after `n` iterations of the loop, with each `dp[i][j]` value calculated based on the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list and the rules provided in the loop body. `i` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`. If the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is 0, `dp[1][n - 1]` is equal to `dp[2][n - 1]`. If the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is exactly 1, `dp[1][n - 1]` is updated to `max(dp[2][n - 1], dp[3][n - 2] + 1)`. If the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is greater than 1, `dp[1][n - 1]` is recalculated to be `max(dp[2][n - 1], dp[3][n - 2] + 1, dp[2][n - 2] + 1, dp[2][n - 1])`.**
