The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on these two variables. Specifically, the loop will iterate from `j = n - 1` down to `j = 0`.

Given that `i` is `n - 3` in the state before the loop starts, this value of `i` does not directly affect the execution of the loop because `i` is not part of the loop head. The loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1, because the range function will create a valid sequence for `j` in that case.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least 1, and `j` should be initialized to `n - 1` as per the loop's starting point.

State: **`dp` table is fully updated after `n` iterations of the loop, with each `dp[i][j]` value calculated based on the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list and the rules provided in the loop body. The initial values of `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` remain `0`, and all other elements of `dp` are updated according to the loop logic. `i` is `n - 3`, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is `n - 1`**
