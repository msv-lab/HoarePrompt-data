Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `l` is greater than or equal to 1; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 0; `y` is equal to `nums[0]`; if the current value of `nums[i]` is greater than `x` (which is initially 0), then `x` is updated to `nums[i]`. Otherwise, `x` remains 0.**

In simpler terms, the value of `y` is now the first element of the list `nums`. The values of `t`, `l`, `nums`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `x` is updated to `nums[0]` if `nums[0]` is greater than the initial value of `x` (which is 0).
