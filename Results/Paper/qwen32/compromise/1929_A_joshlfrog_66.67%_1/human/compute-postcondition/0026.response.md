The code snippet provided is `l = int(input())`. This line of code will read an input from the user, convert it to an integer, and assign it to the variable `l`. This means the value of `l` will be updated to whatever integer the user inputs. The values of the other variables (`t`, `nums`, `x`, `y`, `e`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `l` is the integer value provided by the user input; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `x` is the maximum value found in `nums`; `y` is the minimum value found in `nums`; `e` is `e + 1`.**
