The variable `y` is assigned the value of `nums[i]`. The initial state specifies that `i` is `i + 1` and there is a condition that updates `x` if `nums[i] > x`. However, the given code snippet does not affect the value of `x` or `i`, and it only assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `y`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`. If `nums[i] > x`, then `x` is updated to `nums[i + 1]`. `y` is `nums[i]`.**
