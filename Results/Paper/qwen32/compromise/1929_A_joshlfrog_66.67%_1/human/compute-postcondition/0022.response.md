Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `l` is greater than or equal to 1; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 2. If `nums[i]` is less than `y`, then `y` is updated to `nums[i]`; otherwise, `y` remains 100000000. If `nums[i]` is greater than `x`, then `x` is updated to `nums[i]`; otherwise, `x` remains unchanged.**
