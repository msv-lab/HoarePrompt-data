The code snippet `x = nums[i]` updates the value of `x` to the current element in the list `nums` at index `i`. The values of `t`, `l`, `e`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `l` is greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a list of integers, `e` is `e + 1`, `x` is `nums[i]`, `y` is updated to `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is less than the previous `y`, otherwise `y` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`.**
