Reasoning:
The problem requires us to find the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, the optimal strategy is to arrange the array in either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing order. In both cases, the beauty is maximized by the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the array.

The provided code, however, does not follow this strategy. Instead, it calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the array and prints this difference. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the arrangement of the elements in between the maximum and minimum values, which can contribute to the beauty of the array.

For example, consider the array [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]. The maximum value is 100, and the minimum value is 43. The difference between them is 57, but the maximum beauty can be achieved by arranging the array in increasing order [43, 54, 80, 90, 100] or decreasing order [100, 90, 80, 54, 43], which results in a beauty of 57 + 26 + 10 + 7 = 100.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array.

Correctness: **False**
