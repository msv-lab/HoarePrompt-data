Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The program calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which is not the correct approach to maximize the beauty.

The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, the array should be rearranged such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This can be achieved by sorting the array in either ascending or descending order.

For example, consider the input:
```
2
3
2 1 3
2
2 1
```

The correct output should be:
```
2
1
```

However, the provided program will output:
```
1
1
```

This is because the program calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which does not maximize the beauty as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
