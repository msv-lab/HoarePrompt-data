Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after the array is rearranged to maximize this sum. The program instead calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the array, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

To maximize the beauty, the array should be rearranged such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This can be achieved by sorting the array in either ascending or descending order and then calculating the beauty based on the sorted array. The provided program does not perform any sorting or summing of differences between consecutive elements, which is necessary to solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
