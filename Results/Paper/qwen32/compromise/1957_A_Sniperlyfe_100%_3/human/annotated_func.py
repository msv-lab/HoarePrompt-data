#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two parts: the first part is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks, and the second part is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: freq is a dictionary with counts of each element in arr. For example, if arr = [2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5], freq will be {2: 2, 3: 2, 1: 1, 4: 1, 5: 1}.
    return sum(v // 3 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the dictionary `freq` by 3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the total number of complete sets of three sticks that can be formed from the given list of stick lengths across all test cases.
