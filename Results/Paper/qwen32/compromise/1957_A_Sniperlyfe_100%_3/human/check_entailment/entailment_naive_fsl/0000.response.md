Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program is incorrect because it assumes that the minimum number of sticks required to form a regular polygon is 3 (which is true for triangles), but it does not account for polygons with more sides. 

The problem description requires finding the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed using the given sticks, where each polygon can have more than 3 sides. The current implementation only considers forming triangles (polygons with 3 sides) by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 3.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
6
2 2 2 2 2 2
```
The program will output `2` because it can form two triangles with the given sticks. However, the correct answer should be `1` because we can form a single hexagon (6-sided polygon) with all six sticks.

Thus, the program fails to handle cases where polygons with more than 3 sides can be formed, making it incorrect.
