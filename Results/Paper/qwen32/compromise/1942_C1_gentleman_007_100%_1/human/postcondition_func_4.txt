The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` representing the number of vertices in a graph, and `m` representing the number of edges. It returns a list `l` of `n + 1` lists, where each inner list contains the indices of the vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex, effectively representing an adjacency list of the graph.
