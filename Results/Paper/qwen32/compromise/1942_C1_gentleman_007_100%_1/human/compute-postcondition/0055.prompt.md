Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary or adjacency list representing the graph where each key is a vertex and its value is a list of adjacent vertices, `vis` is a list or dictionary used to keep track of visited vertices where `vis[node]` is 1 if the node has been visited and 0 otherwise, `q` is a deque object with `ver` appended to it, and `vis[ver]` is 1.
Code of the loop:
while len(q):
    ver = q.popleft()
    print(ver, end=' ')
    for node in graph[ver]:
        if not vis[node]:
            q.append(node)
            vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: - All neighbors of `ver` will have been processed.
- Each unvisited neighbor of `ver` will have been added to `q`.
- Each unvisited neighbor of `ver` will have been marked as visited in `vis`.

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing, all the neighbors of the vertex `ver` that were not previously visited will have been added to the queue `q`, and their corresponding entries in `vis` will have been set to `1`.

Output State:
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: All neighbors of all nodes that were removed from `q` have been visited. Each visited node is marked as `1` in `vis`, and all unvisited neighbors of these nodes have been added to `q`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: All neighbors of `ver` that were not previously visited are added to `q`, and all neighbors of `ver` are marked as visited in `vis`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
