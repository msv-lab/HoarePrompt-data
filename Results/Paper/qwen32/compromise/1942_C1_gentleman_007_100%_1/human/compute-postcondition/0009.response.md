Output State: **`ver` is a vertex that is a key in `graph` and `graph[ver]` is a list or set containing at least one neighbor. `node` is a vertex in `graph` such that `vis[node]` is `1`. `q` has `node` appended to it.**

In this output state, the value of `vis[node]` has been changed to `1`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
