Postcondition: **`dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` contains the length of the LCS of the first `i` elements of `a` and the first `j` elements of `b`. `i` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1. If `dp[i][j] == dp[i - 1][j]`, then `i` is at least 1, `j` is at least 2. Otherwise, `l` is a list that now contains the element `a[i]` appended to it.**
