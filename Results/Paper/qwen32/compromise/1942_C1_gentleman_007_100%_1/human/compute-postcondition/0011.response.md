The only object in the loop head is the variable `node`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates over each `node` in `graph[ver]`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more `node` in `graph[ver]` that has not yet been iterated over.

At the end of the previous iteration, `node` was the last node that was processed from `graph[ver]`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `node` should be the next node in `graph[ver]`.

Let's assume `graph[ver]` contains at least two nodes, and the previous iteration processed the first node. In that case, the next node in `graph[ver]` should be assigned to `node`.

State: **`ver` is a vertex that is a key in `graph` and `graph[ver]` is a list or set containing at least two neighbors. If `vis[node]` is `1`, then `node` is appended to `q`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `q`. `node` is the next neighbor in `graph[ver]` after the previously processed node.**
