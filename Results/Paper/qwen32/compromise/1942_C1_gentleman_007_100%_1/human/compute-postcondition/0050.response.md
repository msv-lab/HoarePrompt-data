The code snippet `q.append(node)` adds the value of `node` to the end of the list `q`. The values of `ver`, `graph[ver]`, and `node` remain unchanged as per the given initial state.

Output State: **`ver` is a node that has at least two neighbors in the graph, `graph[ver]` is a list containing at least two neighbors, and `node` is the next neighbor in the list `graph[ver]` after the last one processed; `q` has `node` appended to it.**
