The only object in the loop head is the variable `node`. According to the code, the loop iterates over each neighbor in `graph[ver]`. At the end of the last iteration, `node` was the next neighbor in `graph[ver]` after the previously processed node.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `node` should be the next neighbor in `graph[ver]` that has not yet been processed. Since `graph[ver]` is a list or set containing at least two neighbors, and the previous iteration processed one of them, there must be at least one more neighbor to process.

State: **`ver` is a vertex that is a key in `graph` and `graph[ver]` is a list or set containing at least two neighbors; `node` is the next neighbor in `graph[ver]` that has not yet been processed.**
