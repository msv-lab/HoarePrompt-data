The code appends `node` to the queue `q`. This means that `q` now contains one additional element, which is `node`. The other variables `ver`, `graph[ver]`, and `node` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ver` is the leftmost element that was removed from `q`, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one unvisited neighbor, `node` is the next unvisited neighbor in `graph[ver]`, `q` now contains `node` as an additional element.**
