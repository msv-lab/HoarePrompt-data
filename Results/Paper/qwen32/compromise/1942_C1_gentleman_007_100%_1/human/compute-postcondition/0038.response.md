The code snippet `ver = q.popleft()` removes the leftmost element from the queue `q` and assigns it to the variable `ver`. Given the initial state, the only change is that `ver` now holds the value of the leftmost element that was removed from `q`. The precondition that all neighbors of all nodes that were removed from `q` have been visited and each visited node is marked as `1` in `vis` remains valid. Additionally, `q` must still contain at least one unvisited node, unless `q` was initially of size 1 and that node was just removed.

Output State: **`ver` holds the value of the leftmost element that was removed from `q`; all neighbors of all nodes that were removed from `q` have been visited; each visited node is marked as `1` in `vis`; `q` must contain at least one unvisited node unless it was initially of size 1 and that node was just removed.**
