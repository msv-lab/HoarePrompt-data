The value of `i` is decremented by 1. The value of `j` remains unchanged, and the 2D list `dp` retains its previous state. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` contains the length of the LCS of the first `i` elements of `a` and the first `j` elements of `b`. Now, `i` is at least 1, and `j` is at least 2.
Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` contains the length of the LCS of the first `i` elements of `a` and the first `j` elements of `b`; `i` is at least 1; `j` is at least 2.**
