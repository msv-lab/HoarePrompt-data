Output State: **`ver` is the leftmost element that was removed from `q`, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one unvisited neighbor, `vis[node]` is `False`, and `node` has been appended to `q`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is that `node` has been added to the queue `q`, while the other conditions about `ver`, `graph[ver]`, and `vis[node]` remain unchanged.
