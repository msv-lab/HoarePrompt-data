Output State: **`ver` is a vertex that is a key in `graph` and `graph[ver]` is a list or set containing at least two neighbors; `node` is the next neighbor in `graph[ver]` that has not yet been processed; `q` has `node` appended to it.**

Natural language explanation: The variable `q` now includes `node` at the end of its list, while `ver` and `graph[ver]` remain unchanged. The variable `node` still represents the next neighbor in `graph[ver]` that has not yet been processed.
