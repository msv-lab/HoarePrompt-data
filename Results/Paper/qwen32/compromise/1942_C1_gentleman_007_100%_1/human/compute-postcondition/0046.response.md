The code snippet `q.append(node)` adds the `node` to the end of the list `q`. The other variables (`ver`, `graph[ver]`, and `node`) remain unchanged in terms of their values and relationships as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`ver` is a node that has at least two neighbors in the graph, `graph[ver]` is a list containing at least two neighbors, `node` is the next neighbor in the list after the last one processed, and `q` now includes `node` at the end of its list.**
