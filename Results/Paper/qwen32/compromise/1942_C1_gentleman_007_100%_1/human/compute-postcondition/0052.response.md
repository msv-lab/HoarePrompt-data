Postcondition: **`ver` is a node that has at least two neighbors in the graph, `graph[ver]` is a list containing at least two neighbors, and `node` is the next neighbor in the list `graph[ver]` after the last one processed. If `vis[node]` was initially 0, then `q` has `node` appended to it and `vis[node]` is set to 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `q` or `vis[node]`.**
