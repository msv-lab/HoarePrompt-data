The code sets the value of `vis[node]` to 1, indicating that the node has been visited. No other variables are modified in this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`ver` is a node that has at least two neighbors in the graph, `graph[ver]` is a list containing at least two neighbors, `node` is the next neighbor in the list after the last one processed, and `q` now includes `node` at the end of its list. `vis[node]` is 1.**
