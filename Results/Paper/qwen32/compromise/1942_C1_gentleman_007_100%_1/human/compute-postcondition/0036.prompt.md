Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ver` is the leftmost element that was removed from `q`; all neighbors of the previous `ver` will have been processed except for at least one unvisited neighbor, which will have been added to `q`; each unvisited neighbor of the new `ver` will have been marked as visited in `vis`.
Code of the loop:
for node in graph[ver]:
    if not vis[node]:
        q.append(node)
        vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ver` is the leftmost element that was removed from `q`, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one unvisited neighbor. If `vis[node]` is `0`, then `vis[node]` is updated to `1` and `node` is appended to `q`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `vis[node]` or `q`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ver` is the leftmost element that was removed from `q`, `graph[ver]` contains at least one unvisited neighbor, `node` is the next unvisited neighbor in `graph[ver]`. If `node` was not visited (`vis[node]` was 0), then `q` now contains `node` as an additional element and `vis[node]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `q` and `vis[node]` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ver` is the leftmost element that was removed from `q`, `graph[ver]` contains at least one unvisited neighbor, `node` is the next unvisited neighbor in `graph[ver]`. If `node` was not visited, `q` now includes `node` as its new rightmost element and `vis[node]` is set to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
