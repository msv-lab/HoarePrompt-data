The function accepts a 2D list `l` of integers and returns a 2D list `p` of dimensions `(n+1) x (m+1)`. Each element `p[i][j]` in the returned list represents the sum of all elements in the submatrix of `l` from `(0,0)` to `(i-1,j-1)`, where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns in `l`.
