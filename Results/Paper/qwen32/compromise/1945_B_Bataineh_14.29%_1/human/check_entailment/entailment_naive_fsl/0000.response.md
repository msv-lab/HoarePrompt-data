Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic used in the program is incorrect and does not account for the actual overlap of fireworks in the sky.

Let's analyze the provided code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if m < a or m < b:
            print(2)
        else:
            print(m // a + m // b + 2)
```

The logic in the code is flawed for several reasons:
1. The condition `if m < a or m < b:` is incorrect. The number of fireworks visible at the same time is not necessarily 2 when `m` is less than `a` or `b`.
2. The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` is also incorrect. It does not correctly calculate the maximum number of overlapping fireworks. It simply adds the number of fireworks launched by each installation up to `m` minutes and adds 2, which is not the correct approach.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the maximum number of overlapping fireworks. This involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and then calculating the number of fireworks launched by each installation up to a certain point and considering their overlaps.

Here is a correct approach:
1. Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
2. Determine the number of fireworks launched by each installation up to a certain point.
3. Calculate the overlaps of fireworks.

A correct implementation would look something like this:
```python
import math

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // math.gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
        max_fireworks = (m // a) + (m // b) - (m // lcm_ab)
        if m >= a:
            max_fireworks += 1
        if m >= b:
            max_fireworks += 1
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

In this correct implementation:
- We calculate the LCM of `a` and `b` to determine the overlap period.
- We count the number of fireworks launched by each installation up to `m` minutes.
- We subtract the number of fireworks that are counted twice due to overlap.
- We add 1 for each installation if `m` is greater than or equal to the launch interval of that installation.

Therefore, the original program is incorrect.
