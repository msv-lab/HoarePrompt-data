### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining the minimum number of operations needed to transform an initial state `s1` of cats in boxes to a desired state `s2`. The operations allowed are adding a cat, removing a cat, or moving a cat from one box to another.

The given function `func_1` calculates the number of cats that need to be added (`cats_to_add`) and the number of cats that need to be removed (`cats_to_remove`). The function then returns the maximum of these two values.

Let's analyze why this approach works:
1. **Adding Cats (`cats_to_add`)**: This count represents the number of positions where there is no cat in the initial state (`s1[i] == '0'`) but there should be a cat in the final state (`s2[i] == '1'`). Each of these positions requires at least one operation to place a cat there.
2. **Removing Cats (`cats_to_remove`)**: This count represents the number of positions where there is a cat in the initial state (`s1[i] == '1'`) but there should not be a cat in the final state (`s2[i] == '0'`). Each of these positions requires at least one operation to remove a cat from there.
3. **Max of Both Counts**: The function returns the maximum of `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove`. This ensures that we account for the most significant action required (either adding or removing cats) and implicitly handles moving cats from one box to another. If `cats_to_add` is greater, it means we need to focus on adding cats, and similarly for `cats_to_remove`.

Since moving a cat from one box to another can be considered as removing a cat from one box and adding it to another, the maximum of the two counts effectively captures the minimum number of operations needed. If `cats_to_add` is equal to `cats_to_remove`, the operations can be balanced out by moving cats between boxes. If one is greater, that count dictates the minimum number of operations.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state to the desired state.

**Correctness: True**
