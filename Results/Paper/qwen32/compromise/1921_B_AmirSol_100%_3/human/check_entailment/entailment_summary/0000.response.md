### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of operations needed to transform the initial state of cat placements (`s1`) into the desired state (`s2`). The operations allowed are adding a cat, removing a cat, or moving a cat from one box to another.

The given solution calculates two values:
- `cats_to_add`: the number of positions where a cat needs to be added (i.e., positions that are '0' in `s1` but '1' in `s2`).
- `cats_to_remove`: the number of positions where a cat needs to be removed (i.e., positions that are '1' in `s1` but '0' in `s2`).

The solution then returns the maximum of these two values. This makes sense because:
- If there are more positions where cats need to be added than removed, the limiting factor is the number of additions needed.
- If there are more positions where cats need to be removed than added, the limiting factor is the number of removals needed.
- If the numbers are equal, the number of additions or removals will be the same, and moving cats between boxes can be used to balance out the operations.

Thus, the maximum of `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove` correctly represents the minimum number of days required, as each day can either add a cat, remove a cat, or move a cat, and the largest of these two counts determines the minimum number of days needed to achieve the desired configuration.
