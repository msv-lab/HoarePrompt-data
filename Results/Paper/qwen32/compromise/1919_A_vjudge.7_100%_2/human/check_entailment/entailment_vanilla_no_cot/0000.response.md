To determine the correctness of the program, we need to analyze the logic used in the solution and compare it with the problem description.

The game can be analyzed as a combinatorial game theory problem. The key insight here is that the game can be reduced to a game of Nim with two piles (the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets). The game state can be described by the number of coins in each wallet, and the player who faces a losing position (where the sum of coins in both wallets is even) will lose if both players play optimally.

The reason is that if the sum of coins in both wallets is even, the second player can always mirror the first player's moves. If the sum is odd, the first player can always force a position where the sum is even for the second player.

The provided program uses this insight correctly:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
- It checks if the sum of the coins in both wallets is even (`a + b & 1 == 0`).
- If the sum is even, it prints "Bob" (since Bob will win if both play optimally).
- If the sum is odd, it prints "Alice" (since Alice will win if both play optimally).

Thus, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules.

Correctness: **True**
