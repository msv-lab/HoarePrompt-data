### Reasoning

The original assessment is based on the observation that the parity (evenness or oddness) of the total number of coins (a + b) determines the winner when both players play optimally. This reasoning aligns with the provided function summary and the program code. Let's break it down further to ensure there are no discrepancies.

1. **Problem Analysis**:
    - The game involves two players taking turns.
    - Each player can choose to swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
    - After the choice, the player removes one coin from their current wallet.
    - The player who cannot make a move loses.
    - The game is symmetric and deterministic, and the winner depends on the parity of the total number of coins.

2. **Key Observation**:
    - If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob will always win.
    - If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, Alice will always win.

3. **Program Code**:
    - The function reads the number of test cases.
    - For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets (a and b).
    - It checks whether the sum of the coins (a + b) is even or odd using the bitwise AND operation (`a + b & 1`).
    - If the sum is even (`a + b & 1 == 0`), it prints "Bob".
    - If the sum is odd, it prints "Alice".

4. **Function Summary**:
    - The function correctly implements the logic based on the parity of the total number of coins.

5. **Validation**:
    - The provided examples in the problem description match the expected output based on the parity of the sum of coins.
    - For instance:
        - In the first test case, `a = 1` and `b = 1`, so `a + b = 2` (even), and the output is "Bob".
        - In the second test case, `a = 1` and `b = 4`, so `a + b = 5` (odd), and the output is "Alice".
        - This pattern holds for all provided test cases.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic based on the parity of the total number of coins. The original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
