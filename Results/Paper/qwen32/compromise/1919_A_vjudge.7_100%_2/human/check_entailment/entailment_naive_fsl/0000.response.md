Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The given program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the parity (odd or even) of the sum of coins in both wallets. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Game Analysis**:
   - The game ends when both players cannot make a move, i.e., both wallets are empty.
   - The key observation here is that the player who starts (Alice) will win if the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, and Bob will win if the total number of coins is even.
   - This is because if the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position where the remaining coins are even, and vice versa. The game can be seen as a series of moves where the parity of the total coins dictates the winner.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - It then checks if the sum of the coins (a + b) is even or odd using the bitwise AND operation (`a + b & 1`).
   - If the sum is even (`a + b & 1 == 0`), it prints "Bob" (since Bob wins when the total number of coins is even).
   - Otherwise, it prints "Alice" (since Alice wins when the total number of coins is odd).

3. **Verification**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic derived from the game analysis.
   - It handles all edge cases, including when `a` and `b` are both 1 (Bob wins) and when `a` and `b` are very large (up to \(10^9\)).

Since the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner for all possible inputs, the correctness is **True**.
