Output State: **After executing all iterations, the program will have printed either 'Bob' or 'Alice' for each of the `test` test cases based on whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd, respectively. The values of `a`, `b`, and `t` will reflect the last iteration's values, and `test` will remain unchanged.**
