### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given that each sign occurs periodically and must occur sequentially in the order provided. The provided code attempts to solve this by iterating through the list of periodicities for each test case, calculating the year each sign should occur based on the previous sign's occurrence year, and printing the year the n-th sign occurs.

However, there is a fundamental misunderstanding in the code's logic. The code calculates the year for each sign as the next multiple of that sign's periodicity after the previous sign's occurrence year. This is not the correct approach because the signs do not need to follow a least common multiple pattern; they simply need to follow a sequential pattern based on their respective periodicities.

The correct approach should be to find the next occurrence of each sign after the previous one, which is correctly implemented in the loop `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. This line effectively finds the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than the current `start_year`.

Given this analysis, the code is correctly implementing the intended logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, and the output matches the example provided in the problem statement.
