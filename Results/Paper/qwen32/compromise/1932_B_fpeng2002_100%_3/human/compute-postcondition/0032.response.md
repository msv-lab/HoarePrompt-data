In the given for loop, the loop variable is `x`, and the range is determined by the length of the list `nums`. The loop will execute if the length of `nums` is at least 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `nums` contains at least one integer for the loop to execute. The variables `start_year` and `num_tests` are not directly involved in the loop's execution and do not need adjustment based on the loop's head.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

State: **`start_year` is 0, `num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer**
