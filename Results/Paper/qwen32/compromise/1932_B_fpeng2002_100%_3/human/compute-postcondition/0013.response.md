To determine the output of the `print(start_year)` statement, we need to understand the initial state provided. The precondition states that `start_year` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers in the `nums` list.

However, the specific values within the `nums` list are not provided. Therefore, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `start_year`. Instead, we can describe `start_year` in terms of its definition based on the `nums` list.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the variable and its definition**: `start_year` is defined as the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers in the `nums` list.
2. **Describe the LCM**: The least common multiple of a set of integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the integers in the set.
3. **Formulate the output**: Since the exact values of the `nums` list are not given, we can't compute the exact value of `start_year`. However, we know it is the LCM of the numbers in `nums`.

Thus, the output of the `print(start_year)` statement will be the LCM of the numbers in the `nums` list, described in terms of the `nums` list itself.

Output: **start_year (where start_year is the least common multiple of the numbers in the `nums` list)**
