To determine what will be printed by the `print(start_year)` statement, let's break down the given initial state:

- `start_year` is defined as the least common multiple (LCM) of all the numbers in the list `nums`.
- `num_tests` is set to 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers.

From this information, we know that `start_year` is computed based on the LCM of the elements in the list `nums`. However, the exact elements of `nums` are not provided, so we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `start_year`.

Therefore, the output will describe `start_year` in terms of the LCM of the elements in `nums`.

Output: **start_year (where start_year is the least common multiple of all the numbers in the list `nums`)**
