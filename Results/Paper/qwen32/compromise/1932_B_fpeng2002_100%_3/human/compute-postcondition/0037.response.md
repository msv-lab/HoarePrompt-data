The code snippet updates the `start_year` to be the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than the current `start_year`. Given that `x` is incremented before this line, we need to consider the value of `nums[x]` at the current `x` position.

Output State: **`start_year` is the next multiple of `nums[x]` greater than the previous `start_year`, `num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is `x + 1`.**

In natural language: The `start_year` has been updated to the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than its previous value. The other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, and `x`) remain unchanged except that `x` has been incremented by 1.
