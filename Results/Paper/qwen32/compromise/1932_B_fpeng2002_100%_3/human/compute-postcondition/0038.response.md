To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the effect of each iteration on the `start_year` variable. The loop iterates over each element in the list `nums`, adjusting `start_year` to be the next multiple of the current element that is greater than or equal to the previous `start_year`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `start_year` is 0.
   - `num_tests` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer (not used in the loop).
   - `nums` is a list of integers.

2. **First Iteration**:
   - `x` is 0.
   - `start_year` is set to `(0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`, which simplifies to `nums[0]`.

3. **Second Iteration**:
   - `x` is 1.
   - `start_year` is set to `(nums[0] // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`. This results in the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than or equal to `nums[0]`.

4. **Third Iteration**:
   - `x` is 2.
   - `start_year` is set to `((nums[0] // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]`. This results in the smallest multiple of `nums[2]` that is greater than or equal to the result from the second iteration.

Following this pattern, after all iterations (i.e., for each `x` from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`), `start_year` will be adjusted to be the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to the `start_year` from the previous iteration. This means `start_year` will be the least common multiple (LCM) of all the numbers in `nums`, starting from 0 and incrementally adjusting to meet the criteria for each number in the list.

**Final Output State**:
- `start_year` will be the least common multiple (LCM) of all the numbers in `nums`.
- `num_tests` remains 0.
- `n` remains an input integer (unchanged).
- `nums` remains a list of integers (unchanged).

Output State: **`start_year` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all the numbers in `nums`, `num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers.**
