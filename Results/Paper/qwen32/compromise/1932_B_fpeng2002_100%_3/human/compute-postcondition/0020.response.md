Output State: **`start_year` is `(0 // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, `num_tests` is one less than its previous value and must still be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 integer.**

Natural Language: The value of `start_year` is recalculated to be the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than 0. The value of `num_tests` is decreased by 1 but remains greater than 0. The values of `n` and `nums` remain unchanged.
