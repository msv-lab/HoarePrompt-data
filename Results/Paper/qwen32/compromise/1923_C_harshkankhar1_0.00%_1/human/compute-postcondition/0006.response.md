To determine the output of the `print(*a)` statement, we need to understand the state of the list `a` based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t`, `n`, and `q` are integers.
- `c` is a list of integers.
- `a` is a list of integers where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements up to that index in the original list `c`.
- `b` is a list where `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of 1s and 2s based on the condition `a[i] > 1` for each `i` from 1 to `n`.

### Understanding `a`:
The list `a` is constructed such that each element `a[i]` is the sum of all elements in `c` from the start up to and including the `i`-th element.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Initialization**: Assume `c = [c_0, c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n-1}]`.
2. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**:
   - `a[0] = c[0]`
   - `a[1] = c[0] + c[1]`
   - `a[2] = c[0] + c[1] + c[2]`
   - ...
   - `a[i] = c[0] + c[1] + ... + c[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`

### Example:
Let's say `c = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, then:
- `a[0] = 1`
- `a[1] = 1 + 2 = 3`
- `a[2] = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6`
- `a[3] = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10`

Thus, `a = [1, 3, 6, 10]`.

### Output:
The `print(*a)` statement will print all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

Output: **a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1] (where each a[i] is the cumulative sum of the elements up to the i-th index in the list c)**

Since the exact list `c` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `a`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the cumulative sums of the list `c`.

Output: **a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1] (where each a[i] is the cumulative sum of the elements up to the i-th index in the list c)**
