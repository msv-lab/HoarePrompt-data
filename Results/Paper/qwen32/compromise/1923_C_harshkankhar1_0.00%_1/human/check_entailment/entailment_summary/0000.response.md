Let's analyze the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to determine if a subarray of the given array `c` is "good" based on three conditions:
1. The sum of the elements in the subarray `c[l_i:r_i+1]` should be equal to the sum of the elements in another array `b` of the same length, where `b[i] > 0` for all `i`.
2. Each element in `c[l_i:r_i+1]` should not be equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
3. The subarray should have more than one element (i.e., `l_i != r_i`).

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases, the length of the array, and the number of queries. It then reads the array `c` and the list of queries.
2. **Array `b` Construction**: The program constructs an array `b` such that each element is `1` if the corresponding element in `c` is greater than `1`, otherwise `2`. The cumulative sum of this array `b` is computed and stored.
3. **Cumulative Sum of `c`**: The program computes the cumulative sum of the array `c` to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray.
4. **Query Evaluation**: For each query, the program checks if the sum of the subarray in `c` is less than the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b`. If it is, the program prints "NO". If not, and the subarray has more than one element, it prints "YES".

### Issues in the Program
1. **Condition for "Good" Subarray**: The program checks if the sum of the subarray in `c` is less than the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b`. However, for the subarray to be "good", the sum of the subarray in `c` should be equal to the sum of the subarray in `b`, not less.
2. **Single Element Subarrays**: The program handles single-element subarrays by checking `x == y`, but the condition for a subarray to be "good" is that it should have more than one element.

### Correctness
Given the issues mentioned, the program is not correctly implementing the conditions for a subarray to be "good". Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
