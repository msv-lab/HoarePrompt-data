Reasoning:
The problem requires determining the minimum number of islands Everule can visit after Dominater destroys at most `k` bridges. Initially, all islands are connected, and Everule can visit all islands. Dominater's goal is to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit by destroying bridges optimally.

The key insight here is that Everule will always be able to visit at least island 1. The strategy for Dominater is to disconnect island 1 from as many other islands as possible. The minimum number of bridges that need to be destroyed to disconnect island 1 from all other islands is `n - 1` (one to each of the other islands). If `k` is at least `n - 1`, Dominater can disconnect island 1 from all other islands, leaving Everule with only island 1 to visit. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, Dominater cannot disconnect island 1 from all other islands, and Everule can still visit all `n` islands.

The provided program correctly implements this logic:
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
- It checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. If true, it prints `1` (Everule can only visit island 1). Otherwise, it prints `n` (Everule can visit all islands).

This matches the expected behavior based on the problem statement and examples provided.

Correctness: **True**
