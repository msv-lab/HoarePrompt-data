Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `path` is a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '@', and '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.'; `a` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `d` is an input integer; `b` is an input value that must have at least 1 element; `j` is 2; `s` is set to 2 if `b[j]` is '@', 1 if `b[j]` is '*', otherwise `s` is 0. If `b[j + 1]` is '*', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, but this does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `path`, `a`, `i`, `d`, `b`, or `j`.**
