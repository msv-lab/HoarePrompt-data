Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `path` is a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '@', and '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.'; `a` is greater than 0; `i` is 1; `d` is an input integer; `b` is a non-empty string; `j` is the index of the first '*' in `b` or the length of `b` if no '*' is present; `s` is 0; `b[j]` is '*'; and `b` is not an empty string; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
