Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 0. If `l[0]` is `2` and `l[1]` is `1`, then `j` is set to `1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `j` remains `0`.**
