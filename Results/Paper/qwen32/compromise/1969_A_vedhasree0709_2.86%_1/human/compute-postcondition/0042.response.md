The variable `j` is assigned the value 1. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` must be greater than or equal to 2; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 1; `j` is 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` must be greater than or equal to 2; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 1; `j` is 1.**
