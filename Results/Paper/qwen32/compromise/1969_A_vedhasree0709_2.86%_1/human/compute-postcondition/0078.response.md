The `break` statement in the given code snippet will exit the innermost loop or if statement it is placed in. However, since there is no loop or if statement provided in the context, the `break` statement will have no effect on the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, or `j`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` must be at least 3, `l` is a new list of integers read from the input, `i` is 2, and `j` is 1.**
