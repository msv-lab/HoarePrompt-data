Output State: **`t` remains unchanged as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is at least 1, `l` is a new list of integers read from the input with `l[0]` equal to 2 and `l[1]` equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The only impact of the `break` statement is that it exits the most internal loop or if statement.
