The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a new input string, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring into an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `l`. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is the new input integer; `j` is 0 indicating that the condition `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1` was never met for any `i`.**
