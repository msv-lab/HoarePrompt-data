The code snippet provided is `t = int(input())`. This line of code reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The variable `t` represents the number of test cases. The values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this line of code as they are introduced in subsequent test cases.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; `n` and `k` are still two positive integers (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}) for each test case.**
