Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to increase the median of the given array by the minimum number of operations, where each operation consists of incrementing one element by 1.

### Key Points
1. **Median Definition**: 
   - For an array of odd length `n`, the median is the middle element of the sorted array.
   - For an array of even length `n`, the median is the element at index `n // 2` after sorting (i.e., the lower middle element).

2. **Operation**: 
   - We can increase any element of the array by 1 in one operation.

3. **Objective**: 
   - Find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.

### Program Analysis
Let's break down the provided program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The array `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

3. **Median Index Calculation**:
   - The median index `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
     - For odd `n`, `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` simplifies to `n // 2`.
     - For even `n`, `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` simplifies to `n // 2 - 1`.

4. **Counting Operations**:
   - The program initializes `res` to 0.
   - It then iterates over the elements from the median index `mdx` to the end of the array.
   - For each element that is equal to the median `a[mdx]`, it increments `res` by 1.
   - Finally, it prints `res`.

### Issues in the Program
- **Median Index Calculation**: The median index calculation is incorrect.
  - For an array of odd length `n`, the median index should be `n // 2`.
  - For an array of even length `n`, the median index should be `n // 2 - 1`.
  - The current calculation `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` is incorrect for even `n`.

- **Operation Counting**: The program counts the number of elements equal to the median. This does not necessarily give the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.
  - The correct approach would be to calculate the number of operations needed to make the median element larger than the current median.

### Correct Approach
- Sort the array.
- Determine the median index correctly.
- Calculate the number of operations needed to make the median element larger than the current median.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
