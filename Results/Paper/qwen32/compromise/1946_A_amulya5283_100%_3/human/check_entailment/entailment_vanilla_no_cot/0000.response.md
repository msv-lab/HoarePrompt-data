Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Here are the key issues:

1. **Single Element Array**: The code correctly handles the single element array by printing `1`, but this is not the correct logic for increasing the median. If the array has only one element, increasing it by 1 will indeed increase the median, but the logic should be generalized to all cases.

2. **Median Calculation**: The median is correctly identified as the middle element for odd `n` and the lower of the two middle elements for even `n`. However, the logic to determine the number of operations to increase the median is flawed.

3. **Counting Operations**: The current logic counts the number of elements equal to the current median, which is not the correct way to determine the minimum operations required to strictly increase the median. Instead, the program should focus on increasing the current median to a value strictly greater than the current median.

4. **Handling Even and Odd Lengths**: The program does not correctly handle the distinction between even and odd lengths of the array in terms of how many elements need to be increased to change the median.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            mdx = n // 2
            if n % 2 == 0:
                current_median = a[mdx - 1]
            else:
                current_median = a[mdx]
            
            # Find the smallest number greater than the current median
            target = current_median + 1
            operations = 0
            
            # Count how many elements need to be increased to at least target
            for i in range(mdx, n):
                if a[i] < target:
                    operations += target - a[i]
                else:
                    break
            
            print(operations)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version calculates the number of operations required to increase all elements up to the median (or the lower of the two middle elements for even `n`) to a value strictly greater than the current median, ensuring the median is increased.
