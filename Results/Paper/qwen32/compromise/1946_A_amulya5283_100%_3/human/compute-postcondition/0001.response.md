The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute.

Given that `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, it already satisfies the condition `t > 0`. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes the first time.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
