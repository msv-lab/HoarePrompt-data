Postcondition: **`t` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the sorted list of integers read from the input, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, and `res` is the count of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`. If `n` is 1, the value of `res` remains unchanged as it was not set initially. If `n` is not 1, `res` is correctly calculated as the count of elements from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.**
