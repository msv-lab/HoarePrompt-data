The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `t` and `t` is `t - 1`. This implies that `i` was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `t + 1`. The value of `n` remains the same since it is the upper bound of the loop.

Given that `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, and the loop runs from `mdx` to `n`, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than `n` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is the sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, if `n` equals 1, the list `a` contains exactly one integer, otherwise, `res` is incremented by 1 if `a[mdx]` equals `a[i]`, otherwise `res` remains 0, `i` is `t + 1`**
