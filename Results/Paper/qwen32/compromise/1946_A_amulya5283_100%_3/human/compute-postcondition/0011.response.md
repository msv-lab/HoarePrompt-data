To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in range(mdx, n):
```

The variables in the loop head are `i`, `mdx`, and `n`. The state before the loop starts includes `t`, `n`, `a`, `res`, and `mdx`. However, only `mdx` and `n` can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

### Analysis:
1. **`n`**: This is the upper bound of the range. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than `mdx`.
2. **`mdx`**: This is the starting point of the range. It is already defined as `n // 2` if `n` is odd, and `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even. To ensure the loop executes, `mdx` must be less than `n`.

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
- `n` must be greater than `mdx`.
- Since `mdx` is derived from `n`, ensuring `n` is greater than 1 (as `n` cannot be equal to 1) will ensure `mdx` is less than `n`.

### Adjustments:
- Ensure `n` is greater than 1 (since `n` cannot be equal to 1).

### State Adjustment:
Given that `n` is not equal to 1, we need to ensure `n` is at least 2 to guarantee that `mdx` is less than `n`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer where `n` is greater than 1; `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `res` is 0; `mdx` is `n // 2` if `n` is odd, and `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even**
