The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is `t - 1`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 before it is decremented.

Therefore, before the decrement, `t` must have been at least 1. After the decrement, `t` should be 1 to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`t` must be 1, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. If `n` equals 1, the list `a` contains exactly one integer. Otherwise, `mdx` remains `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` and `res` is the count of elements from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`**
