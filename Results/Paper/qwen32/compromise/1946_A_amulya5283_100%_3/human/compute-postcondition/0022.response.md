To determine the output of the `print(res)` statement, we need to understand the variables and their relationships as described in the initial state.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `res` is the count of elements in the list `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]`, starting from index `mdx` to `n-1`.
- `mdx` is an index in the list `a`.
- `n` is the length of the list `a`.

### Steps to Determine `res`:
1. **Identify the Element to Compare**: The element to compare against is `a[mdx]`.
2. **Count Occurrences**: Count the number of occurrences of `a[mdx]` in the sublist of `a` starting from index `mdx` to the end of the list (`n-1`).

### Output Description:
The value of `res` is the count of elements in the sublist of `a` from `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `mdx`, and `n` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the count of occurrences as described.

### Final Output:
Output: **res (where res is the count of elements in the list `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]` starting from index `mdx` to `n-1`)**
