The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `mdx`, `n` is greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be increased by 1 so `i` is `mdx + 1` and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `mdx + 1`.

State: **`t` is 0, `n` is greater than `mdx + 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, and `res` is 1 if the element at index `mdx` in `a` is equal to the element at index `i` in `a`; otherwise, `res` remains 0, `i` is `mdx + 1`**
