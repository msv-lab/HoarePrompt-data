The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the last value that satisfied `mdx <= i < n`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, provided it is still less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `i` has just finished an iteration where `mdx <= i < n`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer where `n` is greater than 1; `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `mdx` is `n // 2` if `n` is odd, and `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even. If the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to the current value of `a[i]`, then `res` is set to 1. Otherwise, `res` remains 0; `i` is incremented by 1**
