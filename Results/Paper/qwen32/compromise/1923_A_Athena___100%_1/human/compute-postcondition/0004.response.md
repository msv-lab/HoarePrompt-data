Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from the input; `res` is 0.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `res` has been initialized to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state.
