The code snippet `res += 1` increments the value of the variable `res` by 1. Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `a`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only variable affected is `res`, which is incremented.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `n` is equal to `len(a)` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `res` is incremented by 1.**
