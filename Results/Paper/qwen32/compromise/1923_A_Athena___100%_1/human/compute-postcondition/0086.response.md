Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 999, `a` is a non-empty list with at least one element, `n` is the integer input by the user, `res` is incremented by 1 if the current element `a[i]` is 0 (previously 1 if the current element `a[i]` was 0; otherwise, `res` remains 0), `i` is `i + 1`.**
