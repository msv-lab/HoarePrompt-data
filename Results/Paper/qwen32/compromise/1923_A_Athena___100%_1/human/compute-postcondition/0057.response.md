The code snippet `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Given the initial state, `res` can either be 0 or 1. After the increment, `res` will be either 1 or 2, respectively. The values of `t`, `a`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 999, `a` is a list with at least one element, `n` is the integer input by the user, `res` is either 1 or 2, and `i` is `i + 1`**.
