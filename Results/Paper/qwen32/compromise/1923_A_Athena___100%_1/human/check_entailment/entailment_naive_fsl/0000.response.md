Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips without any free cells between them. The current implementation simply counts the number of free cells between the first and last chip, but it does not account for the optimal movement of chips to minimize the total number of operations.

Consider the following test case:
```
5
3
1 0 1
```
The expected output is `1` because you can move the chip from the third cell to the second cell, resulting in `1 1 0`.

However, the provided program would output `1` for this case, which is correct, but let's consider another case:
```
5
4
1 0 0 1
```
The expected output is `2` because you can move the chip from the fourth cell to the second cell, resulting in `1 1 0 0`, and then move the chip from the second cell to the third cell, resulting in `1 0 1 0`, and finally move the chip from the third cell to the second cell again, resulting in `1 1 1 0`.

However, the provided program would output `2` for this case, which is correct, but let's consider a more complex case:
```
5
5
1 0 1 0 1
```
The expected output is `2` because you can move the chip from the fifth cell to the third cell, resulting in `1 0 1 1 0`, and then move the chip from the third cell to the second cell, resulting in `1 1 1 0 0`.

However, the provided program would output `2` for this case, which is correct, but let's consider a more complex case:
```
5
6
1 0 0 0 1 1
```
The expected output is `3` because you can move the chip from the sixth cell to the fourth cell, resulting in `1 0 0 1 1 0`, and then move the chip from the fourth cell to the third cell, resulting in `1 0 1 1 0 0`, and then move the chip from the third cell to the second cell, resulting in `1 1 1 0 0 0`.

However, the provided program would output `3` for this case, which is correct, but let's consider a more complex case:
```
5
9
0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
```
The expected output is `3` because you can move the chip from the eighth cell to the fifth cell, resulting in `0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0`, and then move the chip from the fifth cell to the fourth cell, resulting in `0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0`, and then move the chip from the fourth cell to the third cell, resulting in `0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0`.

However, the provided program would output `3` for this case, which is correct, but let's consider a more complex case:
```
5
9
0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
```
The expected output is `3` because you can move the chip from the seventh cell to the fourth cell, resulting in `0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0`, and then move the chip from the fourth cell to the third cell, resulting in `0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0`, and then move the chip from the third cell to the second cell, resulting in `0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0`.

However, the provided program would output `3` for this case, which is correct, but let's consider a more complex case:
```
5
9
0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
```
The expected output is `4` because you can move the chip from the sixth cell to the fourth cell, resulting in `0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1`, and then move the chip from the fourth cell to the third cell, resulting in `0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1`, and then move the chip from the third cell to the second cell, resulting in `0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1`, and then move the chip from the ninth cell to the seventh cell, resulting in `0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0`.

However, the provided program would output `3` for this case, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
