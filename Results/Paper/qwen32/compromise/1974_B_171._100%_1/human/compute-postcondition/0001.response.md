The given Python code snippet initializes an empty dictionary named `char_map`. This action does not affect the values of `encoded` or `unique_chars`. Therefore, the `encoded` list of strings and the `unique_chars` sorted list of unique lowercase Latin letters remain unchanged.

Output State: **`encoded` is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string b is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5. The total length of all strings in the list does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique lowercase Latin letters present in the strings of `encoded`; `char_map` is an empty dictionary.**
