Output State: **The program returns a string `decoded` which is formed by mapping each character in each string of `encoded` using `char_map`. Each character in the original strings of `encoded` is replaced by its corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars` in reverse order as defined in `char_map`.**

This means that every character in the strings within the `encoded` list is transformed according to the mapping rules specified in `char_map`, resulting in the `decoded` string.
