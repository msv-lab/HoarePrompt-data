The code snippet calculates the length of the `unique_chars` list and assigns it to the variable `len_unique`. The other variables (`encoded` and `char_map`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`encoded` is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string b is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5. The total length of all strings in the list does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique lowercase Latin letters present in the strings of `encoded`; `char_map` is an empty dictionary; `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`.**
