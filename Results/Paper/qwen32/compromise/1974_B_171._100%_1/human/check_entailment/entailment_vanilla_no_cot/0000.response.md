Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to decode the string by reversing the encoding process. However, there is a fundamental misunderstanding in the way the decoding is implemented. The program creates a mapping from the unique characters of the encoded string `b` to their symmetric counterparts, but this mapping is not the correct inverse of the encoding process.

The issue arises because the mapping created in `func_1` is based on the unique characters of the encoded string `b`, not the unique characters of the original string `s` before encoding. Since the encoding process involves mapping characters from the unique sorted set of `s` to their symmetric counterparts, the decoding process should reverse this by mapping each character in `b` back to its corresponding character in the original unique sorted set of `s`.

To fix this, the program should:
1. Determine the unique sorted set of characters `r` from the encoded string `b` (though it should be the unique sorted set of the original string `s`, but since we don't have `s`, we have to deduce it from `b`).
2. Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart.
3. Decode the string `b` using this mapping.

However, since the problem guarantees that the input `b` is a valid encoded string, the unique characters of `b` should indeed be the same as the unique characters of `s` in the context of the encoding process, and the provided program's logic should work correctly in practice. The issue lies more in the conceptual misunderstanding rather than a practical error in this specific context.

Given the problem constraints and the provided program's behavior, the program works as intended for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness should be considered as **True** in the context of the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
