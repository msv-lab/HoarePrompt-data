The code processes `t` test cases, each with three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. For each test case, it calculates `A` and `B` based on `m`, `a`, and `b`, and then prints the sum `A + B`. Since the code does not store the results of each test case or modify the initial values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` outside of the loop, the only change is that the code outputs the sum `A + B` for each test case.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each of the following t lines contains three integers a, b, and m such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18. For each test case, the sum of `int(m/a) + 1` and `int(m/b) + 1` is printed.**
