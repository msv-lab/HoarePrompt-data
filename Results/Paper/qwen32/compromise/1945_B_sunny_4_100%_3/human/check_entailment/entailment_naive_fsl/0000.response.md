Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The current implementation simply adds the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the time frame `m` and adds 2, which is incorrect.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the overlap of the visibility periods of fireworks from both installations. Specifically, we need to count the number of distinct time intervals during which fireworks from either installation are visible and account for overlaps.

The current implementation does not handle overlaps correctly and incorrectly adds 2 to the sum of fireworks from both installations, which is not always valid.

Here is a potential counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
6 7 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
5
```

Explanation of the counterexample:
- The first installation launches fireworks at times 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, etc.
- The second installation launches fireworks at times 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, etc.
- Within the first 4 minutes, only the fireworks launched at time 0 are visible (one from each installation), resulting in a maximum of 2 fireworks visible at the same time.
- The program incorrectly calculates `m // a + m // b + 2` which equals `4 // 6 + 4 // 7 + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2` and then adds 3 more, resulting in 5, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
