The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input, `n` and `k`, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k` respectively. Since the initial state mentions that `func_1()` will be called with no arguments but is expected to handle multiple test cases, we assume that the values of `n` and `k` will be provided through the input for each test case.

Given that `n` and `k` are expected to be positive integers within the range of 1 to 26, the execution of the code will update the values of `n` and `k` based on the input provided for each test case.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 26, `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 26.**
