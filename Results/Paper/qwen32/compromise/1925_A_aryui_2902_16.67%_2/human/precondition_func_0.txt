The function takes no input arguments. However, the input to the function is provided through standard input and consists of multiple test cases. Each test case contains two positive integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 26). The first line of input contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 676) denoting the number of test cases.
