The code snippet `t += s` modifies the variable `t` by adding the value of `s` to it. Given the initial state, `t` is initially set to `s`. After the operation, `t` will be `s + s`, which simplifies to `2 * s`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is `2 * s`; `n` must be greater than 0; `m`, `k` are integers read from the input; `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`; `c` is `c + s * l[i] + s^2`; `k` is `k - s`; `i` is `i + 1`**.

This means that `t` has been updated to be twice its original value, while all other variables retain their initial conditions or values as described.
