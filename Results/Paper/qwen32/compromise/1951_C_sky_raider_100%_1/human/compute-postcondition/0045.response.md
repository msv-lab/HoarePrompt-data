Output State: **`t` is `t + 2 * s + s`; `c` is `c + 3 * s * (l[i] + t)`; `k` is the initial `k` minus the total `min(m, k)` accumulated over all iterations minus `2 * s` minus `s`; `i` is `0`; `n` must be greater than 0; `m` and `k` are the integers read from the input; `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `s` is `min(m, k)`**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.
