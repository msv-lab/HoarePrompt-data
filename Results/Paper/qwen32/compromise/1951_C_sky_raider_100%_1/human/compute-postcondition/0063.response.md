`t` is initially `s`, and after executing `t += s`, `t` becomes `s + s`, which simplifies to `2 * s`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `2 * s`, `c` is `c + s * (l[5] + s)`, `k` is `k - s`, `i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 5, `m` and `k` are the integers read from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`**.
