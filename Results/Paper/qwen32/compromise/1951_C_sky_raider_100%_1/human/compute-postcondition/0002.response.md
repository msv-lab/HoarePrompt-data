The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `l`. This means `l` will now hold the list of integers provided in the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input.**
