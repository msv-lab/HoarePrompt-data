Output State: **`t` is `2 * s + s`, `c` is `c + s * l[5] + s * l[6] + 3 * s^2`, `k` is `k - 2 * s`, `i` is 6, `n` must be greater than 6, `m` and `k` are the integers read from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.**

Natural Language: The value of `t` has been updated to `2 * s + s`, which simplifies to `3 * s`. All other variables remain unchanged.
