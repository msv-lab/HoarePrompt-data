The given code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. This operation does not affect the previously defined variables `t`, `c`, or `i`.

Output State: **`t` is the sum of `min(m, k)` over all iterations; `c` is the cumulative sum of `min(m, k) * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration; `k` is the initial `k` minus the total `min(m, k)` accumulated over all iterations; `i` is `n + 1`; `n`, `m`, and `k` are the integers read from the input.**
