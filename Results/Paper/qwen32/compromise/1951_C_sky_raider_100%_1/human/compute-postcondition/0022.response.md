To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the variables evolve with each iteration. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is initialized to 0.
   - `s` is initialized to 0.
   - `c` is initialized to 0.
   - `k` is reduced by `s` after each iteration.
   - `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`.

2. **Loop Iteration**:
   - For each iteration `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
     - `s` is set to `min(m, k)`.
     - `c` is incremented by `s * (l[i] + t)`.
     - `t` is incremented by `s`.
     - `k` is decremented by `s`.

3. **Final State Calculation**:
   - After `n` iterations, `t` will be the sum of `s` values over all iterations.
   - `c` will be the cumulative sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration.
   - `k` will be reduced by the total amount of `s` accumulated over all iterations.
   - `i` will be `n` after the loop finishes.

Let's formalize this understanding into the final output state:

- `t` will be the sum of `s` values over all iterations.
- `c` will be the cumulative sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration.
- `k` will be the initial value of `k` minus the total `s` accumulated over all iterations.
- `i` will be equal to `n` after the loop completes.
- `n`, `m`, `l` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Thus, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **`t` is the sum of `min(m, k)` over all iterations; `c` is the cumulative sum of `min(m, k) * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration; `k` is the initial `k` minus the total `min(m, k)` accumulated over all iterations; `i` is `n`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations:
- `t` accumulates the total amount added in each iteration.
- `c` accumulates the cost based on the current `s`, `l[i]`, and `t`.
- `k` is reduced by the total amount used in each iteration.
- The loop counter `i` reaches `n`, indicating all iterations are complete.
