The code snippet `t += s` increments the value of `t` by `s`. Given the initial state, `t` was initially `t + s`. After executing the code, `t` becomes `(t + s) + s`, which simplifies to `t + 2 * s`.

The other variables (`c`, `k`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t + 2 * s`; `c` is `c + 2 * s * (l[i] + t)`; `k` is the initial `k` minus the total `min(m, k)` accumulated over all iterations minus `s`; `i` is `n`; `n` must be greater than 0; `m` and `k` are the integers read from the input; `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `s` is `min(m, k)`**.
