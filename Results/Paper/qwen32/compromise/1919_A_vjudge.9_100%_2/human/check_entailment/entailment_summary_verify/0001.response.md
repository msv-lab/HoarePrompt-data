### Reasoning

To verify the correctness of the program, we need to ensure that the logic aligns with the optimal play strategy derived from the game rules. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Game Rules Recap:**
   - Players start with `a` and `b` coins respectively.
   - Players take turns, and in each turn, a player can either swap wallets or keep the current wallet and remove one coin.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The game can be analyzed based on the parity (odd or even) of the absolute difference `abs(a - b)`.
   - If `abs(a - b)` is even, Bob wins.
   - If `abs(a - b)` is odd, Alice wins.

3. **Explanation of the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `a` and `b`.
   - It calculates `abs(a - b)`.
   - If `abs(a - b)` is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If `abs(a - b)` is odd, it prints "Alice".

4. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Test Case: a=1, b=1**
     - `abs(1 - 1) = 0` (even) -> Bob wins.
   - **Test Case: a=1, b=4**
     - `abs(1 - 4) = 3` (odd) -> Alice wins.
   - **Test Case: a=5, b=3**
     - `abs(5 - 3) = 2` (even) -> Bob wins.
   - **Test Case: a=4, b=5**
     - `abs(4 - 5) = 1` (odd) -> Alice wins.
   - **Test Case: a=11, b=9**
     - `abs(11 - 9) = 2` (even) -> Bob wins.
   - **Test Case: a=83, b=91**
     - `abs(83 - 91) = 8` (even) -> Bob wins.
   - **Test Case: a=1032, b=9307**
     - `abs(1032 - 9307) = 8275` (odd) -> Alice wins.
   - **Test Case: a=839204, b=7281**
     - `abs(839204 - 7281) = 831923` (odd) -> Alice wins.
   - **Test Case: a=1000000000, b=1000000000**
     - `abs(1000000000 - 1000000000) = 0` (even) -> Bob wins.
   - **Test Case: a=53110, b=2024**
     - `abs(53110 - 2024) = 51086` (even) -> Bob wins.

The program correctly determines the winner for each test case based on the parity of the difference between `a` and `b`.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the optimal play strategy derived from the game rules. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the program, and the original assessment is correct.

Final: **True**
