You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it prints 'Bob' if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, and 'Alice' if the absolute difference is odd.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins Alice and Bob have. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Game Analysis**:
   - The game revolves around the parity (odd or even nature) of the difference in the number of coins between Alice and Bob.
   - If the difference is even, Bob wins because he can always mirror Alice's moves.
   - If the difference is odd, Alice wins because she can force Bob into a losing position.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - It calculates the absolute difference between the coins in both wallets.
   - It checks the parity of this difference:
     - If the difference is even (`abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`), it prints "Bob".
     - If the difference is odd, it prints "Alice".

3. **Examples**:
   - For the input `1 1`, the difference is `0` (even), so Bob wins.
   - For the input `1 4`, the difference is `3` (odd), so Alice wins.
   - For the input `5 3`, the difference is `2` (even), so Bob wins.
   - For the input `4 5`, the difference is `1` (odd), so Alice wins.
   - For the input `1000000000 1000000000`, the difference is `0` (even), so Bob wins.
   
The program handles all these cases correctly based on the provided problem description and the analysis of the game's mechanics. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
