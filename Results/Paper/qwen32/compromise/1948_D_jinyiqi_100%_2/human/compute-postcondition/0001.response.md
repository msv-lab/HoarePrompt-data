The code assigns the variable `n` the length of the list `s`. The value of `t` and the contents of `s` remain unchanged. Since `s` is a list of characters for each test case, `n` will be the number of characters in that specific list `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `s` is a list of characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark; `n` is the length of the list `s`.**
