The code snippet `count += 1` increments the value of the variable `count` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify a value for `count`, we can infer that `count` is being incremented from whatever its previous value was. The values of `j`, `n`, and `k` are not affected by this operation.

Given that `n` is at least 4 and `k` is `n - 2`, the relationship between `n` and `k` remains unchanged. Therefore, `k` will still be `n - 2`.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is at least 4, `k` is `n - 2`, `count` is increased by 1.**
