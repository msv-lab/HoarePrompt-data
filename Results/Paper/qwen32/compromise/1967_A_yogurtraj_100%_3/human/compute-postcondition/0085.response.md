To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the variables involved in the expression:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. However, the value of `t` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this calculation.
- `n` is the first integer provided by the input. This is the length of the list `a`.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input.
- `rem` is 0.
- `y` is 0.
- `k` is 0, and since the if condition `k != 0` is false, `k` does not affect the calculation.
- `ii` is incremented by `n - 1` from the previous iteration, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `r` is the last element of the list `a`, i.e., `a[n - 1]`.

The print statement is:
```python
print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)
```

Let's break down the expression:
- `r` is the last element of the sorted list `a`, so `r = a[n - 1]`.
- `rem` is 0.
- `y` is 0.

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
```python
(r - 1) * n + 1 + 0 + 0
```
which further simplifies to:
```python
(r - 1) * n + 1
```

Since `r` is the last element of the sorted list `a` and `n` is the length of the list, the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1` calculates a value based on the last element of the list and the length of the list.

Therefore, the final output will be:
Output: **(a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 1 (where a[n - 1] is the last element of the sorted list `a` and n is the length of the list `a`)**
