Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`; `y` is `n - 1 - i`; `i` is `i + 1`; `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`**

Natural Language: The value of `y` has been updated to `n - 1 - i`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `rem`, `i`, and `r`) retain their previous values.
