The only variable in the loop head is `ii`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `ii` is less than the integer provided by the input (which is the value that `ii` is being compared to in the `range` function).

At the end of the previous iteration, `ii` was incremented by `n - 1`. To prepare for the next iteration, `ii` needs to be incremented by 1 (as per the `for` loop's natural behavior).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `ii` incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer provided by the input; `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input; `rem` is 0; `y` is 0; `ii` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration. If `k` is not equal to 0, then `k` is `k - sum((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) for i in range(0, n - 1))` and `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`. Otherwise, `k` is 0 and `r` is `a[n - 1]`.**
