Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input; `rem` is 0; `y` is 0. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, then `k` is set to 0, `r` is set to `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, and `y` is set to `n - 1 - i`. Otherwise, `k` is decremented by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is set to `a[i + 1]`.**
