The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from it. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `ii`, and `i` remain unchanged, except for `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100; `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 2; `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the current input; `ii` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration; `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration; `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.**
