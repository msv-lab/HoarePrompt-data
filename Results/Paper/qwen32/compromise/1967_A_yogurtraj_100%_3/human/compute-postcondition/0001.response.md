The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `ii` is not yet defined (it will be defined by the loop, but the loop is not part of the provided code snippet).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input.**
