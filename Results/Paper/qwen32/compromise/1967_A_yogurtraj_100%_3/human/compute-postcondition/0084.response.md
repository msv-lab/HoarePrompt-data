To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `n` is the first integer provided by the input.
   - `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input.
   - `rem` is 0.
   - `y` is 0.
   - `k` is 0 (since the if condition `k != 0` is false).
   - `ii` is incremented by `n - 1` from the previous iteration.
   - `r` is `a[n - 1]`.

2. **Expression to Evaluate**:
   - The expression to evaluate is \((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y\).

3. **Substitute the Known Values**:
   - `rem` is 0.
   - `y` is 0.
   - `r` is `a[n - 1]`.

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
(r - 1) * n + 1 + 0 + 0 = (r - 1) * n + 1
\]

4. **Determine the Value of `r`**:
   - `r` is the \(n\)-th element of the sorted list `a` (since `r = a[n - 1]`).

5. **Final Expression**:
   - The expression to be printed is \((a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 1\).

Given that `a` is a sorted list of integers and `n` is the first integer provided by the input, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

**Output**: **\((a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 1\) (where \(a[n - 1]\) is the \(n\)-th element of the sorted list `a` and \(n\) is the first integer provided by the input)**
