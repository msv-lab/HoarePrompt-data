The code snippet modifies the value of `k` by subtracting the product of `(i + 1)` and the difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `rem`, and `y` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is updated from `i` to `i + 1` before the execution of the code snippet, so we use `i + 1` in the calculation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input; `rem` is 0; `y` is 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.**
