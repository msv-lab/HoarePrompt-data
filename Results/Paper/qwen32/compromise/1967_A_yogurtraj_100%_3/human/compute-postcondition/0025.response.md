The code snippet `r = a[i + 1]` assigns the value of the element at index `i + 1` in the sorted list `a` to the variable `r`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `rem`, `y`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input; `rem` is 0; `y` is 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`; `r` is `a[i + 1]`.**
