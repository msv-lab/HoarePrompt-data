The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust only these two variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given the for loop statement:
```python
for i in range(0, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
- `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input
- `rem` is 0
- `y` is 0
- `i` is some integer such that `0 <= i < n - 1`

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`.

The variable `n` remains unchanged as it determines the upper limit of the loop.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input; `rem` is 0; `y` is 0; `i` is `i + 1`**
