The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and then assigns this list of integers to the variable `a`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `rem`, `y`, `ii`, `k`) are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer provided by the current input; `a` is the list of integers provided by the current input; `rem` is 0; `y` is 0; `ii` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration; `k` is the second integer provided by the current input.**

In natural language: The variable `a` is now the list of integers from the current input, while all other variables retain their previous values.
