Postcondition: **`i` is `i`. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, and `k` is set to 0, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` and `r` is `a[i + 1]`.**
