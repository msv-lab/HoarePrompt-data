You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains four integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
        
    #State: a series of integers, each representing the result of the computation for one test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and see if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally. According to the rules, Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence is zero.

The program provided is:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
```

### Analysis

1. **Counting Pairs:**
   - `a // 2`, `b // 2`, `c // 2`, and `d // 2` count the number of pairs of each type of number (1, 2, 3, 4). Each pair will result in a zero XOR for that type of number, thus contributing to Bob's wins.

2. **Handling Odd Counts:**
   - The term `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` checks if there is exactly one number left for each type (1, 2, 3) after pairing. If that's the case, the XOR of these three numbers will be zero (since 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0), contributing to one additional win for Bob.

### Correctness Verification

To verify the correctness, let's consider a few cases:

- **Case 1:** `1 1 1 0`
  - Pairs: `0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0`
  - Odd counts: `1 % 2 + 1 % 2 + 1 % 2 = 3`, so `int(3 == 3) = 1`
  - Total wins for Bob: `0 + 1 = 1` (Correct)

- **Case 2:** `1 0 1 2`
  - Pairs: `0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
  - Odd counts: `1 % 2 + 0 % 2 + 1 % 2 = 2`, so `int(2 == 3) = 0`
  - Total wins for Bob: `1 + 0 = 1` (Correct)

- **Case 3:** `2 2 2 0`
  - Pairs: `1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`
  - Odd counts: `0 % 2 + 0 % 2 + 0 % 2 = 0`, so `int(0 == 3) = 0`
  - Total wins for Bob: `3 + 0 = 3` (Correct)

- **Case 4:** `3 3 2 0`
  - Pairs: `1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`
  - Odd counts: `1 % 2 + 1 % 2 + 0 % 2 = 2`, so `int(2 == 3) = 0`
  - Total wins for Bob: `3 + 0 = 3` (Correct)

- **Case 5:** `0 9 9 9`
  - Pairs: `0 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 12`
  - Odd counts: `0 % 2 + 1 % 2 + 1 % 2 = 2`, so `int(2 == 3) = 0`
  - Total wins for Bob: `12 + 0 = 12` (Correct)

The provided program seems to handle all these cases correctly. However, to be thorough, let's consider an edge case:

- **Edge Case:** `3 3 3 3`
  - Pairs: `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4`
  - Odd counts: `1 % 2 + 1 % 2 + 1 % 2 = 3`, so `int(3 == 3) = 1`
  - Total wins for Bob: `4 + 1 = 5` (Correct)

Based on the analysis and the test cases, the program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice, considering all possible cases and edge cases.
