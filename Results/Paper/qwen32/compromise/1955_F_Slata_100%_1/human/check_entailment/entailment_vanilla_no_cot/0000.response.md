To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win, given the rules and constraints of the game.

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR is zero.
   - Eve removes one number at a time, and the goal is to maximize Bob's wins.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The XOR of a sequence is zero if and only if the count of each bit position is even across all numbers.
   - Numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in binary are:
     - 1: `001`
     - 2: `010`
     - 3: `011`
     - 4: `100`
   - Bob wins if the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to create sequences with an even count of each bit position as often as possible.

3. **Strategy:**
   - For each number type (1, 2, 3, 4), if there are an even number of them, they can always be paired to ensure the XOR is zero.
   - If there are an odd number of a particular number type, the last one will contribute to the XOR.
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the remaining numbers can be paired as much as possible.

4. **Implementation:**
   - The program calculates the maximum number of pairs for each number type (`a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2`).
   - It then checks if there are exactly three odd counts among the numbers (`a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3`). If so, it adds one more to the count of Bob's wins, because the remaining three odd numbers can form a sequence with XOR zero.
   - This logic seems correct based on the observations above.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win, given the optimal removal strategy by Eve.
