### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in the function `func()` correctly computes the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice when Eve removes numbers optimally.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the problem and the solution:

1. **Understanding the Winning Condition:**
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.

2. **Properties of XOR:**
   - XOR of two identical numbers is zero (e.g., 1 XOR 1 = 0).
   - XOR of a number with zero is the number itself (e.g., 1 XOR 0 = 1).
   - XOR is commutative and associative, meaning the order of operations does not matter.

3. **Eve's Optimal Strategy:**
   - Eve wants to maximize Bob's wins, which means she wants to maximize the number of times the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
   - To achieve this, Eve should try to pair up numbers such that their XOR is zero.

4. **Analyzing the Numbers:**
   - **Ones (1):** XOR of two ones is zero.
   - **Twos (2):** XOR of two twos is zero.
   - **Threes (3):** XOR of two threes is zero.
   - **Fours (4):** XOR of two fours is zero.

5. **Counting Pairs:**
   - For each type of number (1, 2, 3, 4), Eve can pair up numbers to make their XOR zero.
   - The number of pairs for each type is given by the integer division of the count by 2 (`count // 2`).
   - If there is an odd number of a particular type, one number will be left unpaired.

6. **Handling Unpaired Numbers:**
   - If there are exactly three unpaired numbers (one from each of three types), their XOR can be zero. This is because:
     - 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0
   - Therefore, if the sum of the remainders (`a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2`) equals 3, Bob can win one additional time.

7. **Combining Results:**
   - The total number of times Bob can win is the sum of the pairs for each type plus one if there are exactly three unpaired numbers.

The provided code correctly implements this logic:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
```

- `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` counts the number of pairs for each type.
- `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` checks if there are exactly three unpaired numbers and adds one to the count if true.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
