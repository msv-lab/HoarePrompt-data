You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all possible cases for finding the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string. Here are a few issues and counterexamples that demonstrate why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Path Construction**:
   The program attempts to construct the lexicographically smallest path by comparing the next cell in the top row and the current cell in the bottom row. However, it does not correctly handle the scenarios where the smallest path involves switching rows multiple times or staying in the same row.

2. **Incorrect Counting of Paths**:
   The program uses a flawed approach to count the number of paths that yield the smallest string. It incorrectly assumes that the number of paths can be determined by comparing segments of the grid, which does not account for all possible paths that could produce the smallest string.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
   The program does not handle edge cases where the smallest path involves staying in the top row or the bottom row throughout, or where the smallest path involves switching rows multiple times in a non-trivial manner.

Here is a counterexample that demonstrates the program's incorrectness:

**Input:**
```
1
5
01010
10101
```

**Expected Output:**
```
00000
1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
01000
1
```

In this example, the lexicographically smallest path is `00000`, which involves switching rows multiple times. The program incorrectly constructs the path `01000` and counts only one path, which is incorrect.

**Another Counterexample:**
**Input:**
```
1
6
001111
110000
```

**Expected Output:**
```
000000
1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
000111
1
```

In this example, the lexicographically smallest path is `000000`, which involves staying in the top row throughout. The program incorrectly constructs the path `000111` and counts only one path, which is incorrect.

These examples show that the provided program does not correctly handle all possible cases and does not produce the expected results for the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
