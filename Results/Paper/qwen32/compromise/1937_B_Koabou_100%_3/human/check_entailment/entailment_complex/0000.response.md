Let's analyze the given program and its logic to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by navigating from the top-left to the bottom-right of a 2xN grid, and also count the number of paths that yield this string. The grasshopper can only move right or downwards.

### Program Analysis:
The program defines a function `func_1()` that processes each test case. Let's walk through the logic step-by-step:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The function reads an integer `n`, representing the length of the grid.
   - It then reads two binary strings of length `n`, representing the two rows of the grid.

2. **String Construction Logic:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `s` to store the resulting string and variables `x` and `y` to track indices.
   - It iterates through the grid up to the second last column (`range(n - 1)`).
   - Inside the loop, it checks two conditions:
     - If `a[0][i + 1] == '0'` and `a[1][i] == '1'`, it updates `y` to `i`.
     - If `a[0][i + 1] == '1'` and `a[1][i] == '0'`, it constructs the string `s` by concatenating the part of the first row up to `i + 1` and the part of the second row from `i` onwards. It also updates `x` to `i` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without breaking, `s` remains empty, and `x` remains `0`.

3. **Path Counting Logic:**
   - The function initializes `t` to `1`.
   - It then iterates from `y` to `x` and checks if the substring of the second row from `i` to `x` matches the substring of `s` from `i + 1` to `x + 1`.
   - If a match is found, it updates `t` to `x - i + 1` and breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, `t` remains `1`.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the constructed string `s` and the path count `t`.

### Issues in the Program:
The logic in the program has several issues:
- The construction of the string `s` is incorrect. It does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest string.
- The path counting logic is flawed. It does not correctly count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
- The program does not handle all edge cases, such as when the lexicographically smallest path involves only the first row or only the second row.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly:
1. **Path Construction:**
   - Use dynamic programming or a greedy approach to construct the lexicographically smallest path.
   - At each step, choose the smallest available option (either right or down) until reaching the bottom-right corner.

2. **Path Counting:**
   - Use dynamic programming to count the number of ways to reach the bottom-right corner while constructing the lexicographically smallest path.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the provided program, it does not correctly solve the problem.

**Correctness: False**
