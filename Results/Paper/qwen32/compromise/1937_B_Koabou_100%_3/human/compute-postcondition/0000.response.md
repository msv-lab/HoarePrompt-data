The code snippet provided initializes an empty list `a`. This action does not affect any other variables or the initial conditions of the test cases described. Therefore, the only change in the state is the introduction of the list `a` which is empty.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5) representing the length of the grid, the second and third lines contain binary strings of length n representing the two rows of the grid. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5. `a` is an empty list.**
