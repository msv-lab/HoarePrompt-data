Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9. a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each i. x is a list of n integers such that -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0 for each i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
