Output State: **`t` is 0; `n` and `k` are the last input integers; `healths` is the last list of integers read from the input; `positions` is the last list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples, where each tuple contains a position and a health value, sorted by the absolute value of the position; `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the health values of all monsters if `success` is `True`; `success` is `True` if `total_bullets_used` never exceeded `time_available` for any monster; otherwise, `success` is `False`.**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be 0 because it has been decremented for each iteration. The variables `n` and `k` will hold the values from the last test case. The lists `healths` and `positions` will contain the values from the last test case. The list `monsters` will be a sorted list of tuples (position, health) based on the absolute value of positions from the last test case. The variable `total_bullets_used` will be the total number of bullets used to defeat all monsters in the last test case if it was successful. The variable `success` will be `True` if it was possible to defeat all monsters in the last test case without exceeding the available time; otherwise, it will be `False`.
