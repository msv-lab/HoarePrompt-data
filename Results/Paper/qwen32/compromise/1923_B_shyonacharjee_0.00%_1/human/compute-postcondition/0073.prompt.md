Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is at least 1 and is decremented by 1; `n` and `k` are integers from the input; `healths` is a list of integers from the new input; `positions` is a list of integers from the new input; `monsters` is a sorted list of (position, health) tuples based on the absolute value of positions; `total_bullets_used` is 0; `success` is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    position, health = monsters[i]
    distance = abs(position)
    time_available = distance
    bullets_needed = health
    if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
        success = False
        break
    total_bullets_used += bullets_needed


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 1 and is decremented by 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `k` is an integer from the input; `healths` is a list of integers from the new input; `positions` is a list of integers from the new input; `monsters` is a sorted list of (position, health) tuples based on the absolute value of positions; `total_bullets_used` is `health`; `success` is False if `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`; otherwise, `success` remains True; `position` is the position value from the `i`-th tuple in `monsters`; `health` is the health value from the `i`-th tuple in `monsters`; `distance` is `abs(position)`; `time_available` is `abs(position)`; `bullets_needed` is `health`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 1 and is decremented by 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `k` is an integer from the input; `healths` is a list of integers from the new input; `positions` is a list of integers from the new input; `monsters` is a sorted list of (position, health) tuples based on the absolute value of positions; `total_bullets_used` is `health + bullets_needed`; `position` is the position value from the `i`-th tuple in `monsters`; `health` is the health value from the `i`-th tuple in `monsters`; `distance` is `abs(position)`; `time_available` is `abs(position)`; `bullets_needed` is `health`; `i` is incremented by 1. If `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, `success` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `success` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least 1, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `k` is an integer from the input, `healths` is a list of integers from the new input, `positions` is a list of integers from the new input, `monsters` is a sorted list of (position, health) tuples based on the absolute value of positions, `total_bullets_used` is `3 * health`, `position` is the position value from the `i`-th tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the health value from the `i`-th tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is `abs(position)`, `time_available` is `abs(position)`, `bullets_needed` is `health`, `i` is `i + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
