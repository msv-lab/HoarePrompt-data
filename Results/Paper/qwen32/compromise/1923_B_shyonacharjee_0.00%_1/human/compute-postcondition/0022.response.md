Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer from the input, `healths` and `positions` are lists from the input, `monsters` is a sorted list of (position, health) tuples based on the absolute value of positions, `i` is incremented by 1, `position` is the position from the `i`th tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the health from the `i`th tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is the absolute value of `position`, `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`.**

In natural language: The value of `bullets_needed` is now set to the value of `health`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
