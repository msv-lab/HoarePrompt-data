The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `healths`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that `t` is at least 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `healths` is a list of integers derived from the next input line.**
