The code snippet assigns the value of `mid` to `right`. Given that `mid` is 1, `right` will now also be 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **t is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4; n is 2; s is "10"; mid is 1; leftZero is 0; rightZero is 1; leftOne is 0; rightOne is 1; tleftZero is 0; trightZero is 1; tleftOne is 1; trightOne is 0; left is 0; leftMove is 0; right is 1.**
