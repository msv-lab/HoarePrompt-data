The code snippet `tleftOne += 1` increments the value of `tleftOne` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the only change is the value of `tleftOne`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is adjusted such that `leftZero >= 0`, `rightOne` is adjusted such that `rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2`, `right` is `mid + 2` and `mid < n - 1`, `tleftZero` is less than `(right + 1) // 2`, and if `tleftZero` is not less than `(right + 1) // 2`, then `trightOne` is less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`, `tleftOne` is incremented by 1.**
