Postcondition: **`right` is the smallest index where both `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` are true; `n` is greater than 1; `s` is the input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is 2 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 1; `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `leftOne` is 2; `rightOne` is 0; `tleftZero` is 2 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `tleftZero` is 1; `trightZero` is 0; `tleftOne` is 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `tleftOne` is 2; `trightOne` is 0; `i` is 1.**
