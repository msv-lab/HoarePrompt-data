Postcondition: **right is the smallest index where both tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2 and trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2 are true, tleftZero is the count of '0's in the first half of s up to right, trightZero is the count of '0's in the second half of s up to right, tleftOne is the count of '1's in the first half of s up to right, trightOne is the count of '1's in the second half of s up to right, and left is not equal to 0. Additionally, right is not equal to n. The current value of right satisfies that the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and left is less than or equal to the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and right, or the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and right is less than the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and left.**
