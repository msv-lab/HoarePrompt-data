The code snippet `mid = n // 2` assigns the integer division of `n` by 2 to the variable `mid`. This calculation does not affect any of the other variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`right` is the smallest index where both `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` are true; `n` is an input integer; if `left` is 0, the counts `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` remain as described in the precondition; if `right` equals `n` and `left` is 0, `trightOne` is either greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` with no additional changes, or `trightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`; if `left` is not 0, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s` up to `right`, `trightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` up to `right`, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s` up to `right`, `trightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` up to `right`, and the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`, or the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right` is less than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left`; `s` is the input string; `mid` is `n // 2`.**
