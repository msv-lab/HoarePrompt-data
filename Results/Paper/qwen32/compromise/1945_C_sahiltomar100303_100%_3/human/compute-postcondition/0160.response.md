Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 2 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is an input integer that must be at least 2; `s` is the new input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is 2; `tleftZero` is 0; `trightZero` is 0; `tleftOne` is `tleftOne + 1`; `trightOne` is 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `leftOne` is `leftOne + 1`.**

In simple terms: The value of `tleftOne` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
