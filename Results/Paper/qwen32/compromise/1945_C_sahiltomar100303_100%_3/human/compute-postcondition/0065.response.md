Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is 2; `s` is "10"; `mid` is 1; `left` is 0; `leftMove` is 0; `leftZero` is 0; `rightZero` is 1; `leftOne` is 0; `rightOne` is 1; `tleftZero` is 0; `trightZero` is 1; `tleftOne` is 1; `trightOne` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `left` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 0. Since `left` is now 0, the character at index `left - 1` in `s` does not exist, but the initial conditions for `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` are based on the initial value of `left` being 1, which is still valid as per the given conditions.
