The code snippet increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. Given the initial state, `rightZero` was 1, so after the increment, `rightZero` becomes 2. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is 2; `s` is "10"; `mid` is 1; `leftZero` is -1; `rightZero` is 2; `leftOne` is 1; `rightOne` is 0; `tleftZero` is 0; `trightZero` is 1; `tleftOne` is 1; `trightOne` is 0; `left` is 1; `leftMove` is 0; the character at index `left - 1` in `s` is '0'**.
