Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is adjusted such that `leftZero >= 0`, `rightOne` is adjusted such that `rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2`, `right` is `mid + 2` and `mid < n - 1`, `tleftZero` is less than `(right + 2) // 2`. If `s[right] == '0'`, then `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 and `trightZero` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `trightOne` is decremented by 1 and `tleftOne` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `right` is incremented by 1, so `right` becomes `mid + 2`. The conditions and constraints involving `left`, `leftZero`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, and `tleftOne` remain the same except for the updated value of `right`.
