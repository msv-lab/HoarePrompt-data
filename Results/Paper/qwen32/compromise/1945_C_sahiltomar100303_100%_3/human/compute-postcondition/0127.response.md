Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is 2; `s` is "10"; `mid` is 1; `leftZero` is 0; `rightZero` is 1; `leftOne` is 0; `rightOne` is 1; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is 2; `tleftZero` is 1; `trightZero` is 0; `tleftOne` is 0; `trightOne` is 1; `right` equals `n`. If `left` is not equal to 0, then `left` remains not equal to 0. Otherwise, `left` is set to 0. If `left` is 0 and `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, then `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2. Otherwise, `tleftZero` is less than (n + 1) // 2.**
