Output State: **`right` is the smallest index where both `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` are true; `n` is the input integer; `s` is the input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is `count_zeros_first_half`; `rightZero` is `1`; `leftOne` is `count_ones_first_half`; `rightOne` is `0`; `tleftZero` is `count_zeros_first_half`; `trightZero` is `1`; `tleftOne` is `count_ones_first_half`; `trightOne` is `0`; `i` is `mid`; `s[i]` is '0'**

In this output state, `trightZero` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
