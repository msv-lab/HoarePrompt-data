The code snippet provided increments the value of `leftZero` by 1. None of the other variables are modified by the code snippet. Therefore, the only change in the output state is the value of `leftZero`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 2 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is an input integer that must be at least 2; `s` is the new input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is 2; `i` is `i + 1`; `leftZero` is incremented by 1.**
