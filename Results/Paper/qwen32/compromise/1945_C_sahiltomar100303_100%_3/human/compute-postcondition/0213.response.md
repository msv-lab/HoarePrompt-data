Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 4 to ensure `mid` is greater than 2. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', `leftZero` is decreased by 1 and `rightZero` is increased by 1, with `leftZero` still being less than `(left + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `leftOne` is decreased by 1 and `rightOne` is increased by 1, while `leftZero` remains less than `(left + 1) // 2`.**
