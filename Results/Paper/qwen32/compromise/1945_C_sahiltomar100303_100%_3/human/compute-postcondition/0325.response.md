Output State: **right is the smallest index where both tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2 and trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2 are true; n is the input integer; s is the input string; mid is n // 2; leftZero is count_zeros_first_half; leftOne is count_ones_first_half; tleftZero is count_zeros_first_half; tleftOne is count_ones_first_half; i is n - 1; rightZero is count_zeros_second_half; rightOne is count_ones_second_half; trightZero is count_zeros_second_half; trightOne is count_ones_second_half; left is mid.**

Explanation: The variable `left` is assigned the value of `mid`, which is `n // 2`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
