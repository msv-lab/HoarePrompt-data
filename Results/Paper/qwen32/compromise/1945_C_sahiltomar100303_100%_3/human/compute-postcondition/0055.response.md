The code snippet `left = mid` assigns the value of `mid` to the variable `left`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is an integer read from input; `s` is a string read from input; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`; `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`; `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`; `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`; `left` is `mid`.**
