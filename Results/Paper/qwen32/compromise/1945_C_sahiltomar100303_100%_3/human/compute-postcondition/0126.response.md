Postcondition: **t is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4; n is 2; s is "10"; mid is 1; leftZero is 0; rightZero is 1; leftOne is 0; rightOne is 1; left is equal to 0; leftMove is 0; right is 2; tleftZero is 1; trightZero is 0; tleftOne is 0; trightOne is 1; right equals n; left is equal to 0. If tleftZero is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, then tleftZero is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2. Otherwise, tleftZero is less than (n + 1) // 2.**

To simplify: **t is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4; n is 2; s is "10"; mid is 1; leftZero is 0; rightZero is 1; leftOne is 0; rightOne is 1; left is equal to 0; leftMove is 0; right is 2; tleftZero is 1; trightZero is 0; tleftOne is 0; trightOne is 1; right equals n; left is equal to 0. The condition tleftZero >= (n + 1) // 2 is evaluated, and the state remains the same with tleftZero being either greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2 or less than (n + 1) // 2.**
