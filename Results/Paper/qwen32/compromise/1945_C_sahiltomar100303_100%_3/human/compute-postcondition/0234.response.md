`tleftZero` is incremented by 1. The values of `s`, `right`, `n`, `tleftZero`, `trightOne` remain as per their initial conditions except for `tleftZero`. The conditions `right` is increased by 1 and must be less than `n-1`, and either `tleftZero` must be less than `(right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne` must be less than `(n - right + 1) // 2` still hold true but with the updated value of `tleftZero`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `right` is increased by 1 and must be less than `n-1`, `tleftZero` is increased by 1, `tleftZero` must be less than `(right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne` must be less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`**.
