You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Annotated Code: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to n, where `d[i]` represents the depth of nested parentheses at position `i`, and `d[n]` is 0.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: ans is the same as the original string s.
    return ans
    #The program returns the original string s



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The input string `s` is read from standard input. This string is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence.
   - The input string is passed to the function `func_1`.

2. **Prefix Balance Calculation:**
   - A dictionary `d` is initialized with the initial balance `0` at position `0`.
   - The program iterates through each character in the string `s`.
   - For each character, it updates the balance:
     - If the character is `'('`, it increments the balance by `1`.
     - If the character is `')'`, it decrements the balance by `1`.
   - The balance is stored in the dictionary `d` with the key being the position (1-based index) of the character in the string.

3. **Removing Last Entry:**
   - The last entry of the dictionary `d` (which corresponds to the balance after the last character) is removed. This is because the last balance is not required for the balanced shuffle operation.

4. **Sorting:**
   - The dictionary `d` is converted to a list of tuples and sorted based on two criteria:
     - First, by the balance in increasing order.
     - Second, by the position in decreasing order (to break ties).

5. **Constructing the Result:**
   - A new string `ans` is constructed by iterating through the sorted list of tuples and appending the character at the corresponding position in the original string `s` to `ans`.

6. **Returning the Result:**
   - The constructed string `ans` is returned as the result of the balanced shuffle operation.

**Correctness Analysis:**
- The program correctly calculates the prefix balance for each position in the string.
- It then sorts the positions based on the balance and position criteria as described in the problem statement.
- Finally, it constructs the balanced shuffle by appending characters from the original string in the sorted order of positions.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
