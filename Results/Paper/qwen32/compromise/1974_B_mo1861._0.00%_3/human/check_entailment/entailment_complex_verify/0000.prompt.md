You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'. 

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/b6f889887677396af4d296900b8ca492324e83ef.png)
The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

    #State: - After the loop completes, `s` will contain a sequence of characters where each character in `b` has been replaced by its corresponding value in `char_map`.
    #
    #To illustrate this with an example, let's consider a specific string `b` and derive the `char_map`:
    #
    #Assume `b = "banana"`.
    #- Unique characters in `b` are `a`, `b`, `n`.
    #- Sorting these characters in ascending order gives `a`, `b`, `n`.
    #- Reversing this order gives `n`, `b`, `a`.
    #- Mapping these in order to 'a', 'b', 'c' gives `char_map = {'n': 'a', 'b': 'b', 'a': 'c'}`.
    #
    #Now, applying the loop:
    #- For `c = 'b'`, `s += 'b'` → `s = 'b'`
    #- For `c = 'a'`, `s += 'c'` → `s = 'bc'`
    #- For `c = 'n'`, `s += 'a'` → `s = 'bca'`
    #- For `c = 'a'`, `s += 'c'` → `s = 'bcac'`
    #- For `c = 'n'`, `s += 'a'` → `s = 'bcaaca'`
    #- For `c = 'a'`, `s += 'c'` → `s = 'bcaacac'`
    #
    #So, the final state of `s` is `'bcaacac'`.
    #
    #Output State:
    return s
    #The program returns the string 'bcaacac'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `b` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `s` where each unique character in `b` is replaced by a character starting from 'a' and incrementing alphabetically based on the reverse order of the unique characters sorted in ascending order.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code incorrectly maps each character in the encoded string `b` to its symmetric character in the sorted set of characters from `b`. However, the problem statement requires mapping each character in the encoded string `b` to its corresponding original character based on the symmetric character in the sorted set of characters from the original string `s`.

Here is a concrete example that demonstrates the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
5
abcde
```

**Expected Output:**
```
edcba
```

**Explanation:**
- The distinct characters in the encoded string `b` are `a, b, c, d, e`.
- The sorted set of characters `r` is `abcde`.
- The symmetric mapping should be: `a -> e`, `b -> d`, `c -> c`, `d -> b`, `e -> a`.
- Therefore, the decoded string `s` should be `edcba`.

**Actual Output from the Provided Code:**
```
edcba
```

However, the problem is that the code does not handle the case where the original string `s` has a different set of distinct characters from the encoded string `b`. For example:

**Input:**
```
1
5
edcba
```

**Expected Output:**
```
abcde
```

**Explanation:**
- The distinct characters in the encoded string `b` are `a, b, c, d, e`.
- The sorted set of characters `r` is `abcde`.
- The symmetric mapping should be: `e -> a`, `d -> b`, `c -> c`, `b -> d`, `a -> e`.
- Therefore, the decoded string `s` should be `abcde`.

**Actual Output from the Provided Code:**
```
abcde
```

The code seems to work for this specific example, but let's consider a more complex example where the distinct characters in the original string `s` are different from those in the encoded string `b`:

**Input:**
```
1
5
edcba
```

**Expected Output:**
```
abcde
```

**Explanation:**
- The distinct characters in the encoded string `b` are `a, b, c, d, e`.
- The sorted set of characters `r` is `abcde`.
- The symmetric mapping should be: `e -> a`, `d -> b`, `c -> c`, `b -> d`, `a -> e`.
- Therefore, the decoded string `s` should be `abcde`.

**Actual Output from the Provided Code:**
```
abcde
```

However, if the original string `s` had a different set of characters, the code would fail. For example:

**Input:**
```
1
5
edcba
```

**Expected Output:**
```
abcde
```

**Explanation:**
- The distinct characters in the encoded string `b` are `a, b, c, d, e`.
- The sorted set of characters `r` is `abcde`.
- The symmetric mapping should be: `e -> a`, `d -> b`, `c -> c`, `b -> d`, `a -> e`.
- Therefore, the decoded string `s` should be `abcde`.

**Actual Output from the Provided Code:**
```
abcde
```

The code does not correctly handle the case where the original string `s` has a different set of distinct characters from the encoded string `b`. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
