The provided code snippet is a function definition with a docstring explaining what the function is supposed to do but does not contain any actual code that manipulates variables or performs operations. Therefore, the execution of this code does not change any variables or states.

Since there is no code to execute, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **b is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the function is expected to handle multiple test cases where the total length of all strings b does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.**
