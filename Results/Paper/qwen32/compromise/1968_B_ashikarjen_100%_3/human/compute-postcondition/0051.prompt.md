You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5. a is a binary string of length n, and b is a binary string of length m. The sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of all m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is a binary string of length `n`; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `b` is the binary string input by the user; `k` is the number of characters from `a` that were found in `b` in order; `j` is the position in `b` just after the last found character from `a` or `m` if the loop broke early; `i` is equal to `n` if the loop completes all iterations, or the index at which the loop broke.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (where k is the number of characters from `a` that were found in `b` in order)
    return
    #The program returns nothing (None)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. It performs some operations based on the provided constraints and test cases, but it does not return any value (returns `None`).

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns nothing (None)


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
