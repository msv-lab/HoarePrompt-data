The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `j` is 2, after the increment, `j` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `b` is the binary string input by the user with `b[1] != a[0]` and `b[2] != a[0]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `b[0] != a[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `b` is the binary string input by the user with `b[1] != a[0]` and `b[2] != a[0]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `b[0] != a[0]`**
