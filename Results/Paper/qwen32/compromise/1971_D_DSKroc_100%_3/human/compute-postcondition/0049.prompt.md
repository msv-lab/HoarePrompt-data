Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `s` is a new string provided by the user input and has at least 2 characters, `count` is 0, `flag` is 0, `i` is `len(s) - 2` from the original `s`, `q` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(s) - 1):
    if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
        count += 1
    if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
        flag = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `s` is a string provided by the user input and has at least 2 characters, `count` is 1 if the integer value of `s[i]` is not equal to the integer value of `s[i + 1]`, otherwise `count` remains 0, `flag` is 1 if the integer value of `s[i]` is less than the integer value of `s[i + 1]`, otherwise `flag` remains 0, `i` is `len(s) - 2` from the original `s`, and `q` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `s` is a string provided by the user input and has at least 2 characters, `count` is either 1 or 2, `flag` is 1 if `int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1])`, otherwise `flag` remains 0, `i` is `len(s) - 1`, and `q` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. If `int(s[i])` is not equal to `int(s[i + 1])`, then `count` is 2. Otherwise, `count` remains 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `s` is a string provided by the user input and has at least 2 characters, `i` is `len(s) - 2`, `q` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. If `int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1])`, then `flag` is 1. If `int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1])`, then `count` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged and `flag` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
