Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer input by the user, and `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    s = input()
    count = 0
    flag = 0
    for i in range(len(s) - 1):
        if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
            count += 1
        if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
            flag = 1
    if flag == 0:
        print(count + 1)
    else:
        print(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `s` is a string provided by the user input and has at least 2 characters, `count` is the total number of times consecutive characters in `s` have different integer values, `flag` is either 0 (indicating there is no pair of consecutive characters where the first character has a smaller integer value than the second) or 1 (indicating there is at least one pair of consecutive characters where the first character has a smaller integer value than the second), and `i` is `len(s) - 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `s` is a string provided by the user input and has at least 2 characters, `count` is the total number of times consecutive characters in `s` are different, `flag` is either 0 (indicating there is no instance where a character is less than the next character in the string) or 1 (indicating there is at least one instance where a character is less than the next character in the string), `i` is `len(s) - 2`, and `q` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus `len(s) - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `s` is a new string provided by the user input and has at least 2 characters, `count` is the number of times consecutive characters in `s` have different integer values, `flag` is 0 if no character in `s` is less than the next character, otherwise 1, `i` is `len(s) - 2`, `q` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus the number of iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
