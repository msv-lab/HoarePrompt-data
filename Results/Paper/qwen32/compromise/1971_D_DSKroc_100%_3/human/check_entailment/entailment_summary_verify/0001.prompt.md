You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        flag = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a string `s` consisting of '0's and '1's. It then calculates and prints the number of transitions between different characters in the string `s`. If there are no transitions where a '0' is followed by a '1', it increments the count by 1. This process is repeated for all `t` test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze the logic it uses to solve the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the minimum number of contiguous substrings (pieces) that a given binary string can be cut into, so that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string. A sorted binary string has all '0's before all '1's.

### Key Insight:
The number of pieces required is determined by the number of transitions from '1' to '0' in the string. Each transition indicates a point where the string needs to be cut to allow rearrangement into a sorted order.

### Program Explanation:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.

2. **Counting Transitions:**
   - It initializes `count` to 0, which will count the number of transitions.
   - It initializes `flag` to 0, which will check if there is at least one '0' following a '1'.
   - It iterates through the string, comparing each character with the next one:
     - If there is a transition (i.e., `s[i]` is different from `s[i + 1]`), it increments `count`.
     - If a '0' follows a '1' (`s[i] < s[i + 1]`), it sets `flag` to 1.

3. **Determining the Number of Pieces:**
   - If `flag` is 0, it means there are no '0's following '1's, indicating that the string is either all '0's or all '1's. In this case, only one piece is needed, so it prints `count + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `count`, which is the number of transitions, representing the minimum number of pieces needed.

### Verification:
Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1: `11010`**
   - Transitions: `1->0`, `0->1`, `1->0`
   - `count = 3`
   - `flag = 1` (since there are '0's following '1's)
   - Output: `3`

2. **Example 2: `00000000`**
   - No transitions
   - `count = 0`
   - `flag = 0` (no '0's following '1's)
   - Output: `1`

3. **Example 3: `1`**
   - No transitions
   - `count = 0`
   - `flag = 0` (no '0's following '1's)
   - Output: `1`

4. **Example 4: `10`**
   - Transition: `1->0`
   - `count = 1`
   - `flag = 1` (since there is a '0' following a '1')
   - Output: `1`

5. **Example 5: `0001111`**
   - No transitions from '1' to '0'
   - `count = 0`
   - `flag = 0` (no '0's following '1's)
   - Output: `1`

6. **Example 6: `0110`**
   - Transitions: `0->1`, `1->0`
   - `count = 2`
   - `flag = 1` (since there are '0's following '1's)
   - Output: `2`

The program correctly handles all the provided examples, indicating that the logic is sound.

Based on the analysis and verification, the program is correct.
