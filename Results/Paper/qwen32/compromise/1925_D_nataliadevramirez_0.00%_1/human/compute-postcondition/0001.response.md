The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the integer `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable that does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `t` is greater than or equal to 1. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `friendships`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of children such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `m` is an integer representing the number of pairs of friends such that 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), `k` is an integer representing the number of excursions such that 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^5, and `friendships` is a list of m lists, where each sublist contains three integers a_i, b_i, f_i representing the indices of the pair of friends and their friendship value such that a_i != b_i, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9; `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1**
