The provided Python code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This input operation does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, or `friendships`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of children such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `m` is an integer representing the number of pairs of friends such that 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), `k` is an integer representing the number of excursions such that 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^5, and `friendships` is a list of m lists, where each sublist contains three integers a_i, b_i, f_i representing the indices of the pair of friends and their friendship value such that a_i != b_i, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9; `t` is an input integer.**
