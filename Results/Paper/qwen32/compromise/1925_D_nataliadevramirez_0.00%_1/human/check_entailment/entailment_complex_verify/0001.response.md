### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap:
- We have `n` children and `m` pairs of friends, each with an initial friendship value `f_i`.
- The teacher randomly selects pairs of children `k` times.
- If a selected pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent selections.
- We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions, expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and return \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

#### Key Points:
- The expected value of the friendship value for a given friend pair `(a, b)` is the sum of the initial friendship value `f_i` plus the expected number of times the pair is chosen in subsequent selections.
- The probability of choosing any specific pair in one selection is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\), where \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
- For a given friend pair, the expected number of times it is chosen is `k * (1 / \binom{n}{2})`.
- The expected sum of friendship values for all selections is the sum of the expected values for each friend pair.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It calculates the result for a single test case.
   - It iterates over all `m` friendships.
   - For each friendship, it multiplies the initial friendship value `f` by the sum of the first `k` natural numbers (`k * (k + 1) // 2`).
   - The program seems to assume that the expected value of the friendship value for a single pair is `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2)`, which is incorrect.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It reads the input and processes each test case using `func_1`.
   - It prints the result for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program incorrectly calculates the expected value for each friendship.
- The expected value for a friendship pair `(a, b)` should be calculated as follows:
  - The initial friendship value is `f`.
  - The expected number of times the pair is chosen in `k` selections is `k * (1 / \binom{n}{2})`.
  - The expected increase in friendship value due to being chosen `x` times is the sum of the first `x` natural numbers, which is `x * (x + 1) // 2`. However, the expected number of times the pair is chosen is `k / \binom{n}{2}`, and the expected sum of the first `k / \binom{n}{2}` natural numbers is not simply `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
  - The correct expected value for a friendship pair `(a, b)` is:
    \[
    f + \left(k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\right) \times \left(\frac{k + 1}{2}\right)
    \]
    Simplifying, we get:
    \[
    f + \frac{k(k + 1)}{2 \binom{n}{2}} = f + \frac{k(k + 1)}{n(n-1)}
    \]
- The program does not account for the probability of choosing a pair and the expected number of times it is chosen.
- The program simply multiplies the initial friendship value by the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is not the correct approach.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
