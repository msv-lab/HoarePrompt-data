You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

    #The program returns the result of (sum of f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) for all friendships) % MOD
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the total impact of friendships on excursions by summing the product of each friendship's value and the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, then returns this sum modulo `MOD`.

#Function 2:

    #State: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop, and `t` will be 0 (or whatever value it was initialized to before the loop started, if it was used elsewhere). All other variables not mentioned in the loop will remain in their initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from the input. For each test case, it processes a number of children (`n`), a number of pairs of friends (`m`), a number of excursions (`k`), and a list of friendships with their respective values. It then calls `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result returned by `func_1`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without altering the input variables outside of the loop scope.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The main issue lies in the calculation of the expected value and the handling of the friendship values.

The program calculates the result for each friendship pair by multiplying the initial friendship value `f` by the sum of the first `k` natural numbers (`k * (k + 1) // 2`). This approach assumes that each pair of friends will be chosen `k` times, which is incorrect. The actual probability of choosing a specific pair of friends in one excursion is `1 / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`, and the expected number of times a specific pair is chosen in `k` excursions is `k / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`. Therefore, the expected contribution of each friendship pair to the total sum should be `f * (k / (n * (n - 1) / 2))`.

Additionally, the program does not account for the fact that the friendship values increase by 1 each time a pair is chosen. The expected value calculation should consider the increasing friendship values over the `k` excursions.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3 1 2
1 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- There are 3 children and 1 pair of friends (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 1.
- The total number of possible pairs is `3 * 2 / 2 = 3`.
- The probability of choosing the pair (1, 2) in one excursion is `1 / 3`.
- The expected number of times the pair (1, 2) is chosen in 2 excursions is `2 * (1 / 3) = 2 / 3`.
- The expected contribution of the pair (1, 2) to the total sum is `1 * (2 / 3) + 2 * (1 / 3) = 4 / 3`.
- Since there are 3 possible pairs and only one of them is a friend pair, the expected sum of friendship values is `4 / 3`.
- The expected value as a fraction is `4 / 3`, and `p * q^(-1) % (10^9 + 7)` is `4 * 333333336 % (10^9 + 7) = 3`.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
333333338
```

The program incorrectly calculates the expected value, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
