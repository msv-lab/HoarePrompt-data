### Reasoning:
The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for excursions, considering the increase in friendship values when a pair of friends is chosen. The expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime integers, and the final answer should be \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

Let's analyze the provided functions:

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - This function calculates the total impact of friendships on excursions.
  - For each friendship, it multiplies the friendship's value by the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is \(\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\).
  - It then sums these products and returns the result modulo `MOD`.
  - The formula \(\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\) represents the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is correct for the problem since each friendship's value increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion and we need the sum of these values over `k` excursions.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - This function reads the input, processes each test case, and calls `func_1` to compute the result.
  - It handles multiple test cases correctly by reading the number of test cases and then processing each one in a loop.
  - After computing the result for each test case, it prints the result.

### Analysis of the Approach:
- The approach taken by `func_1` is correct for the problem. It correctly calculates the expected sum of the friendship values for all `k` excursions by considering the increase in friendship values.
- The formula \(\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\) is used to sum the friendship values over `k` excursions, which is appropriate.
- The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) as required by the problem statement.
- `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes each test case, calling `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and printing the results.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Both functions work together to process the input and compute the correct expected value of the sum of friendship values for all excursions, expressed in the required format.
