The code snippet `o_r -= 1` decrements the value of `o_r` by 1. Since `o_r` is the count of the digit `1` in the list `arr`, after this operation, `o_r` will be one less than its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is the input provided by the user; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string` and must have at least one element; `z` is the count of the digit `0` in `arr`; `o` is the count of the digit `1` in `arr`; `z_r` is equal to `z`; `o_r` is equal to `o - 1`; `z_l` is 0; `o_l` is 1; `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`; `ans` is `0`; `pos` is `1`; `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)` if `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`, otherwise `b_d` is `30001`; `i` is not equal to `0`.**
