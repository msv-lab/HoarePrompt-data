The provided code snippet only includes `input_string = input()`, which means the program will wait for user input and assign that input to the variable `input_string`. None of the other variables are affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state, the value of `input_string` will change to whatever the user inputs. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is the input provided by the user; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string`; `z` is the count of the digit 0 in `arr`; `o` is the count of the digit 1 in `arr`; `z_r` is 0; `o_r` is 0; `z_l` is the count of the digit 0 in `arr`; `o_l` is the count of the digit 1 in `arr`; `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`; `ans` is the position where the condition is met for the last time; `pos` is the length of `arr`; `b_d` is the minimum distance from `n / 2` where the condition was met.**
