The code snippet assigns the value of `dist` to `b_d`. Therefore, `b_d` will now have the same value as `dist`, which is `abs(n / 2)`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is the input provided by the user; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string`; `z` is the count of the digit `0` in `arr`; `o` is the count of the digit `1` in `arr`; `z_r` is equal to `z`; `o_r` is equal to `o`; `z_l` is 0; `o_l` is 0; `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is `0`, `pos` is `0`, `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)`. Additionally, `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`.**
