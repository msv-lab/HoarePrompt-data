The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over each element in the list `arr`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `arr` has at least one element for the loop to execute. The other variables mentioned in the state description are not directly involved in the loop's execution and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the first element of `arr`**
