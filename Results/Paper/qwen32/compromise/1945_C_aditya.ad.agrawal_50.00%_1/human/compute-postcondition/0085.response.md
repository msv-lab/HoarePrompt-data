The code snippet provided is `o_r -= 1`, which means the value of `o_r` is decreased by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is the input provided by the user and contains at least one digit; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string` and has at least one element; `z` is the count of the digit 0 in `arr`; `o` is the count of the digit 1 in `arr`; `i` is the next element in `arr`; `pos` is increased by 1; `o_l` is increased by 1; `o_r` is decreased by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `o_r` is reduced by 1, while all other variables retain their previous values.
