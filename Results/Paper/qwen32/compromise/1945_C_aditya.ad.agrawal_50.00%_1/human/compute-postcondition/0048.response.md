The code calculates `b_d` as the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `pos`. The values of `t`, `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `i`, `pos`, `z_l`, `z_r`, `o_l`, `o_r`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the provided code snippet. Only `b_d` is newly assigned a value.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is the input provided by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string` and must have at least one element, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is incremented by 1, if `i` is 0, `z_l` is incremented by 1 and `z_r` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `o_l` is incremented by 1 and `o_r` is decremented by 1, `ans` is equal to `pos`, `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - pos)`**.
