The code snippet provided increments the variable `o_l` by 1. The other variables (`arr`, `i`, `pos`, `z_l`, `z_r`, `o_r`, `b_d`, `ans`, `n`) are not directly modified by this line of code, so their states remain as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_r` and `o_r`, `z_l` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_l` and `o_l`, and `b_d` is equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `pos`, then `ans` is set to the current value of `pos`. If `i` is 0, `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1. `o_l` is increased by 1.**
