The code snippet provided is `t -= 1`. This line of code decrements the value of the variable `t` by 1.

Given the initial state does not mention the variable `t`, we can infer that `t` must have been defined and had a value before this line of code was executed. Since the exact value of `t` is not provided, we will denote its new value as `t - 1`.

The other variables (`pos`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `z_r`, `o_r`, `ans`, `b_d`, and `n`) are not affected by the execution of `t -= 1`, so their states remain the same.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **After all iterations, `pos` will be equal to the length of `arr` (i.e., `n`). `z_l` will be equal to the number of 0s in `arr`. `o_l` will be equal to the number of 1s in `arr`. `z_r` will be 0. `o_r` will be 0. `ans` will be the position where the condition was last met, indicating the position closest to the middle of the array that satisfies the balance condition. `b_d` will be the minimum distance from the middle that satisfied the condition. `t` is decreased by 1.**
