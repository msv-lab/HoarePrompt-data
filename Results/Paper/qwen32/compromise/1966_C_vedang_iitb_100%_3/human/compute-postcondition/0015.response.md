The code increments the value of `mexsize` by 1. Given that `mexsize` was initially either 2 or 3, after the increment, `mexsize` will be either 3 or 4 respectively. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` is either 3 or 4, `sz` is the next element in the list `a`.**
