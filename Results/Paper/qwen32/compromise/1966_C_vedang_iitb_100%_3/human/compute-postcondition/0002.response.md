The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This value of `t` remains unchanged. The new variable `n` is assigned an integer value from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer.**
