To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the `mexsize` variable evolves as the loop progresses through each element in the sorted list `a`.

### Explanation:

- **Initial State:**
  - `mexsize` starts at 1.
  - The loop iterates over each element `sz` in the sorted list `a`.

- **Loop Iteration Logic:**
  - For each element `sz` in `a`, if `sz` equals `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is incremented by 1.
  - This means `mexsize` will increase by 1 every time it finds a consecutive integer in the list starting from 1.

- **Final State:**
  - After the loop completes, `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer that is not present in the list `a`.
  - This is because the loop effectively counts up through the consecutive integers found in `a`, and stops incrementing `mexsize` when it encounters a gap in the sequence.

### Example Walkthrough:

Let's consider an example where `a = [1, 2, 4]`:

- **Iteration 1:** `sz = 1`, `mexsize = 1`. Since `sz == mexsize`, `mexsize` becomes 2.
- **Iteration 2:** `sz = 2`, `mexsize = 2`. Since `sz == mexsize`, `mexsize` becomes 3.
- **Iteration 3:** `sz = 4`, `mexsize = 3`. Since `sz != mexsize`, `mexsize` remains 3.

After these iterations, `mexsize` is 3, which is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `[1, 2, 4]`.

### General Case:

For any sorted list `a`, after the loop finishes, `mexsize` will be the smallest integer greater than 0 that is not in `a`.

### Final Output State:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, and `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.**

This means that `mexsize` will be the smallest missing positive integer from the list `a` after the loop completes.
