Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, and `mexsize` is either 2 or 3 depending on whether `sz` initially equals 1. `sz` is the next element in the list `a`. If `sz` equals `mexsize`, `mexsize` is updated to either 2 or 3 based on its initial value.**
