### Reasoning:
The problem revolves around determining the winner of a game based on the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key insight is that the game can be reduced to a simple parity check of the sum of the coins.

1. **Game Analysis**:
    - If the sum of the coins (`a + b`) is even, Bob wins.
    - If the sum of the coins (`a + b`) is odd, Alice wins.

2. **Explanation**:
    - When the sum of coins is even, Alice and Bob can always mirror each other's moves until there is only one coin left. Since Alice goes first, she will be the one to face an even number of coins on her last move, forcing her to lose.
    - When the sum of coins is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob with an even number of coins, ensuring that Bob eventually faces an odd number of coins on his turn, leading to his loss.

3. **Program Analysis**:
    - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`).
    - For each test case, it reads two integers (`a` and `b`).
    - It checks the parity of the sum (`a + b`).
    - It prints "Bob" if the sum is even and "Alice" if the sum is odd.

The provided program correctly implements this logic, and the comments accurately describe its behavior. Therefore, the program is correct.
