The `while` loop in the provided code will continue to execute as long as `max_heap` is not empty. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `max_heap` contains at least one element.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99
- `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9
- `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9
- `max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples

We need to ensure that `max_heap` is not empty for the loop to execute again. Since the state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `max_heap` contains `n-1` tuples, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 to have `max_heap` contain at least one element.

However, the condition `1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5` already guarantees that `n` is at least 1, so `max_heap` will have at least one element unless it was emptied in the previous iteration. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `max_heap` is not empty after the previous iteration.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `max_heap` still contains at least one tuple.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` must contain at least one tuple**
