The given code snippet calculates the absolute difference between the variable `i` and the first element of the sorted list `b`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, so it is assumed that `i` is a predefined integer value that we need to consider for the calculation.

Since `i` is not specified in the initial state, we will represent the output state in terms of `i`.

The variable `diff1` is introduced and assigned the value of `abs(i - b[0])`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 and `n` is at least 1, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`**.
