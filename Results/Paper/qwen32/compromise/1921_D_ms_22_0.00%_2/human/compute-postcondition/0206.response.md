Postcondition: **`max_heap` is a list containing at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, i, index)` with one tuple removed, `t` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `n` elements, and `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input. `item` is a tuple `(-diff, i, index)` where `diff` is the maximum of `abs(i - b[0])` and `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, `i` is an element from list `a`, and `index` is either `0` or `m - 1` depending on which difference was maximum. The current value of `item[2]` is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`. `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])` and `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `tp1` is updated to 1, `tp2` remains `m - 1`, and `ans` is updated to `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp1` remains 0, `tp2` is updated to `m - 2`, and `ans` is updated to `ans + diff2`.**
