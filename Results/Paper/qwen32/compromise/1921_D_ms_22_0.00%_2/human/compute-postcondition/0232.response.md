The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` and assigns it to `diff2`. The values of `max_heap`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `item`, and `diff1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, i, index)` (one less than before), `t` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `item` is the tuple `(-diff, i, index)` that was the smallest in `max_heap` before the pop operation, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`.**
