Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple after the pop operation, `item` is the tuple that was popped from `max_heap`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`, `tp1` is incremented by 1, `ans` is increased by `diff1`.**

Natural Language: The value of `ans` is increased by the value of `diff1`, which is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`. All other variables remain unchanged except for `ans` and `tp1`, which has been incremented by 1.
