The provided code snippet pushes a new tuple into the `max_heap` using the `heapq.heappush` function. The tuple to be pushed is `(-diff1, i, 0)`, where `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` (the next element in the list `a`) and `b[0]`.

Given the initial state, the variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, and the initial state of `max_heap` do not change. The only variable that changes is `max_heap` as it gains a new element.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, if `diff1` (the absolute difference between `a[t]` and `b[0]`) is greater than `diff2` (the absolute difference between `a[t]` and `b[m - 1]`), `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff1, a[t], 0)`. Otherwise, `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff2, a[t], m - 1)`, `i` is the next element in the list `a`, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, `max_heap` now includes an additional tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`**.
