The code `item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)` removes and returns the smallest item from the `max_heap` based on the heap's ordering, which in this case is a max-heap due to the negative sign in the first element of the tuple `(-diff, i, index)`. This means that the tuple with the largest `diff` value (smallest `-diff` value) will be popped.

After the operation, `max_heap` will have one less element, and `item` will hold the tuple that was popped.

Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, i, index)` (one less than before), `t` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `n` elements, and `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `item` is the tuple `(-diff, i, index)` that was popped from `max_heap`.**
