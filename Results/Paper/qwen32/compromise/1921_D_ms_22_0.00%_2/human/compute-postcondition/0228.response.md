Postcondition: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, i, index)` (one less than before), `t` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `n` elements, and `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `item` is the tuple `(-diff, i, index)` that was popped from `max_heap`. If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, then `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`. If `diff1 > diff2`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff`. Otherwise, if `item[2]` equals `tp2`, `tp2` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff`.**
