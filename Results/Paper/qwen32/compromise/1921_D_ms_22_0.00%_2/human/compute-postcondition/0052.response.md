Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples. If `item[2]` was less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `tp1` and `tp2` are updated based on the comparison of `diff1` and `diff2`, and `ans` is set to the larger difference (`diff1` or `diff2`). Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by the absolute value of `item[0]`. If `item[2]` was equal to `tp1`, `tp1` is updated to 1; otherwise, `tp1` is updated to 0 and `tp2` to `m - 2`. The value of `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive.**
