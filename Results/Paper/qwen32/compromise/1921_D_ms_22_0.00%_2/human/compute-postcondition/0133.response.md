Postcondition: **`t` is `-n`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples of the form `(-diff, a[i], index_in_b)`, `item` is the tuple `(-diff, a[i], index_in_b)` that was popped from `max_heap`, and `ans` is updated based on the conditions. If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, then `tp1` and `tp2` are reset to 1 and `m - 1` respectively if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, otherwise `tp1` and `tp2` are reset to 0 and `m - 2` respectively, and `ans` is set to the larger of `diff1` or `diff2`. If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, `ans` is updated by adding `diff`, and `tp1` or `tp2` is updated to 1 or `m - 2` respectively depending on whether `item[2]` equals `tp1`.**
