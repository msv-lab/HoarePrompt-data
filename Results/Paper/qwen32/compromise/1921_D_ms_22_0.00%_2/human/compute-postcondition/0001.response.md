Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5. `a_i` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9. `b_i` is a list of `m` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9. The sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The current execution context is the main program (i.e., `__name__ == '__main__'`).**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the integer input. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `a_i`, `b_i`) are not affected by this code snippet and retain their initial conditions.
