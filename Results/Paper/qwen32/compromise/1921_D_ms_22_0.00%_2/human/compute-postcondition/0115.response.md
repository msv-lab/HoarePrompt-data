The code snippet `item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)` removes and returns the smallest element from the `max_heap` based on the heap property. Since the elements in `max_heap` are of the form `(-diff, a[i], index_in_b)`, the smallest element (which is the largest `diff` due to the negative sign) will be popped.

Given:
- `max_heap` is a list containing `n` tuples of the form `(-diff, a[i], index_in_b)`.
- `item` is assigned the value of the popped element from `max_heap`.

After the execution of the code, `item` will hold the tuple with the largest `diff` (smallest `-diff`), and the `max_heap` will have one less element.

Output State: **`t` is `-n`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, and `max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples of the form `(-diff, a[i], index_in_b)`. `item` is the tuple `(-diff, a[i], index_in_b)` that was popped from `max_heap`.**
