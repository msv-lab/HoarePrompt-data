The code snippet provided updates the value of `diff2` by calculating the absolute difference between the current element `i` from list `a` and the last element `b[m - 1]` from the sorted list `b`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Given the initial state, the value of `diff2` is recalculated, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 and `n` is at least 1, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `max_heap` contains the tuples `(-abs(i - b[0]), i, 0)` and `(-diff1, i, 0)`. Otherwise, `max_heap` contains the tuples `(-abs(i - b[0]), i, 0)` and `(-abs(new_i - b[m - 1]), i, m - 1)`, `i` is the next element in the list `a`.**
