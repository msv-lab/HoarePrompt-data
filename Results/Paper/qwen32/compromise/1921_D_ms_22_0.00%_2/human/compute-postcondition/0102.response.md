The code calculates the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of the sorted list `b`, and assigns this value to `diff1`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Given:
- `i` is `a[t]`
- `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers

The calculation `diff1 = abs(i - b[0])` uses the current value of `i` and the first element of `b`, which is `b[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `max_heap` is a list containing a tuple, `i` is `a[t]`, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`.**
