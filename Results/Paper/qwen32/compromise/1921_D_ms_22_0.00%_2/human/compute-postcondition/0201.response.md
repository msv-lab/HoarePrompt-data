Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, i, index)` with one tuple removed, `tp1` is 1, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `n` elements, and `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input. `item` is a tuple `(-diff, i, index)` where `diff` is the maximum of `abs(i - b[0])` and `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, `i` is an element from list `a`, and `index` is either `0` or `m - 1` depending on which difference was maximum. The current value of `item[2]` is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`. `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`. `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`. Additionally, `diff1` is greater than `diff2`.** 

In natural language: The value of `tp1` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged, including `max_heap`, `tp2`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `item`, `diff1`, and `diff2`.
