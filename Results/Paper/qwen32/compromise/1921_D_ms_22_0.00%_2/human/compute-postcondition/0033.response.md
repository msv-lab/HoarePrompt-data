The `while` loop in the given code will execute as long as `max_heap` is not empty. Therefore, to ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, `max_heap` must contain at least one element.

Given the state right before the `while` loop:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9
- `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9
- `max_heap` is a list containing `n` tuples, each tuple being `(-abs(a_i - b[0]), a_i, 0)` or `(-abs(a_i - b[m - 1]), a_i, m - 1)` depending on the comparison
- `tp1` is 0
- `tp2` is `m - 1`
- `ans` is 0

The only variable in the loop head is `max_heap`. To ensure that the loop executes, `max_heap` must have at least one element. Given the description, `max_heap` is initially populated with `n` tuples, so it should already have elements unless `n` is 0. However, since the problem states `1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5`, `n` cannot be 0.

Therefore, no adjustment is necessary to `max_heap` to ensure that the loop can execute the first time. The state can be repeated as is.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` is a list containing `n` tuples, each tuple being `(-abs(a_i - b[0]), a_i, 0)` or `(-abs(a_i - b[m - 1]), a_i, m - 1)` depending on the comparison, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, and `ans` is 0**
