You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The given problem requires counting the number of subsegments of array `a` of length `m` that can be rearranged to match at least `k` elements of array `b`. The provided solution uses a sliding window approach combined with the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to efficiently count and compare the elements of the subsegments of `a` with the elements of `b`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **First Window**:
   - The program initializes a counter `cnt_aa` for the first `m` elements of `a` and `cnt_bb` for the elements of `b`.
   - It calculates the intersection `D` of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, which gives the common elements between the first window of `a` and `b`.
   - It also calculates the differences `E` and `C` to represent the elements in `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` that are not in `D`.
   - It calculates the total number of matching elements `tot` in the first window and checks if it is at least `k`.

3. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program then slides the window one element at a time from left to right across `a`.
   - For each slide, it updates the counters `D`, `E`, and `C` by removing the element that is sliding out of the window (`out_aa`) and adding the element that is sliding into the window (`in_aa`).
   - It updates `tot` accordingly and checks if the new total is at least `k`.

4. **Counting Good Subsegments**:
   - The program keeps a count `fnd` of the number of good subsegments.
   - It prints the count `fnd` for each test case.

### Correctness:

The solution efficiently counts the number of good subsegments using a sliding window and counters, which ensures that the time complexity is manageable even for large inputs (`n` and `m` up to `2 * 10^5`).

The approach correctly handles the intersection of element counts and updates the counters as the window slides, ensuring that the solution is both correct and efficient.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
