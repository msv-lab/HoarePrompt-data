Postcondition: **`t` is unchanged, `nabors` is `nabors - 1` and greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers such that `0 < m < n`, `aa` is a list of integers with length `n`, `bb` is a list of integers, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the list `bb`. `C[in_aa]` is 0, and `D[out_aa]`, `E[out_aa]`, and `tot` remain unchanged. `fnd` is 1 if `tot >= k` else 0.**
