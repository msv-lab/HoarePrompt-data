Output State: **`t` (unchanged), `nabors` must be greater than the current iteration count, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `aa` is a list of integers from the input, `bb` is a new list of integers from the latest input.**
The variable `bb` is assigned a new list of integers obtained by splitting the latest input string and converting each split substring to an integer. The values of `t`, `nabors`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `aa` remain unchanged.
