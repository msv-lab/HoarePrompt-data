Postcondition: **`t` is unchanged, `nabors` is `nabors - 1` and greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers such that `0 < m < n`, `aa` is a list of integers with length `n`, `bb` is a list of integers, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the list `bb`. If `D[out_aa] > 0`, then `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1, and `tot` is the sum of the values in `D` minus 1. If `E[out_aa] > 0`, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. In both cases, `fnd` is 2 if `tot >= k` else 1. If `C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]`, then `C[in_aa]` is increased by 1; otherwise, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1.**
