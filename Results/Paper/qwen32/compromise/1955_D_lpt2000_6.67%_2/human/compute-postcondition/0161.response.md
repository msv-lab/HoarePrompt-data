Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `nabors` is `nabors - 1` and greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers such that `0 < m < n`, `aa` is a list of integers with length `n`, `bb` is a list of integers, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the list `bb`, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is 2 if `tot >= k` else 1, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `E[out_aa]` has been decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
