The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged, and the precondition that `nabors` must be greater than the current iteration count is still valid.

Output State: **`t` (unchanged), `nabors` must be greater than the current iteration count, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input.**
