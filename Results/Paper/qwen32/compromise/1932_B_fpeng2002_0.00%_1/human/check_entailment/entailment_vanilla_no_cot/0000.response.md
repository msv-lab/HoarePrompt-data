Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the year in which the n-th sign will occur. Specifically, the line `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` does not correctly determine the next occurrence of the i-th sign after the (i-1)-th sign has occurred.

The correct approach should be to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`. This can be done with the formula: `start_year = ((start_year + nums[x] - 1) // nums[x]) * nums[x]`.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = ((start_year + nums[x] - 1) // nums[x]) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)
```

This corrected version should produce the correct output for the provided examples.
