To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the transformation of the `start_year` variable in each iteration. The loop iterates over the `nums` list, updating `start_year` according to the formula:

\[ \text{start\_year} = \left(\left(\frac{\text{start\_year} + 1}{\text{nums}[x]} + 1\right) \times \text{nums}[x]\right) \]

This formula ensures that `start_year` is always a multiple of `nums[x]` and is incremented in a specific manner.

Let's break down the process:

1. **Initial State**: `start_year = 0`, `x = 0` (the first index of `nums`).
2. **After 1st Iteration**: `start_year = nums[0]`.
3. **After 2nd Iteration**: `start_year = ((nums[0] + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`.
4. **After 3rd Iteration**: `start_year = ((start\_year + 1) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]`.

Following this pattern, after the loop completes all iterations (i.e., `x` goes from `0` to `len(nums) - 1`), the final value of `start_year` will be determined by the last iteration:

\[ \text{start\_year} = \left(\left(\frac{\text{start\_year} + 1}{\text{nums}[len(nums) - 1]} + 1\right) \times \text{nums}[len(nums) - 1]\right) \]

Here, `x` will be equal to `len(nums) - 1` after the last iteration, and the loop will terminate.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **start_year is the result of the last iteration's formula, num_tests is a positive integer less than its previous value, n is an input integer, nums is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, and x is len(nums) - 1.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `start_year` will be a specific multiple of the last element in the `nums` list, calculated by the given formula, and `x` will be the last index of the `nums` list. The other variables (`num_tests` and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states as per the problem statement.
