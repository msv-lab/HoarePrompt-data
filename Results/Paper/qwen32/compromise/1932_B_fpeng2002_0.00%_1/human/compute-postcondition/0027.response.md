The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num_tests` is a positive integer less than its previous value. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `num_tests` must be greater than 0.

Since `num_tests` is a positive integer less than its previous value, we need to adjust it to ensure it is still greater than 0. This means `num_tests` should be set to any positive integer value. However, since we are asked to adhere closely to the state provided and make minimal adjustments, we can simply state that `num_tests` must be greater than 0.

No other states need to be adjusted as they do not affect the loop condition.

State: **`start_year` is the result of the last iteration's formula, `num_tests` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, and `x` is `len(nums) - 1`**
