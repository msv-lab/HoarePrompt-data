Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `start_year` is `((nums[0] + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`, `x` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `start_year` has been recalculated using the formula provided in the code snippet, and all other variables retain their initial states.
