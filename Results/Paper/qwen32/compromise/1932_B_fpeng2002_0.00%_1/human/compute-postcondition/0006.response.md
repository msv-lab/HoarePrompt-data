The only variables in the loop head are `x` and the range parameters `0` and `len(nums)`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the range function will produce at least one value for `x` to iterate over. This means `len(nums)` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `start_year` is 0.

The state of `num_tests`, `n`, and `start_year` do not affect the execution of the loop directly, so they do not need to be adjusted. However, `nums` needs to be adjusted to ensure that it has at least one element.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute is:
State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `start_year` is 0, `x` is 0**
