Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `start_year` is `nums[0]`, `x` is 0**

Explanation: The value of `start_year` is recalculated based on the formula provided in the code snippet. Since `start_year` was initially 0 and `x` is 0, the new value of `start_year` becomes `nums[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
