Reasoning:

The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description and the annotated states. Let's break down the problems:

1. **Special Case Handling in `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` includes a special case where if `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3, it returns 0. This is not aligned with the problem's logic. The function should compute the optimal sum for all possible values of `removals` and `negatives`, not return a hardcoded value for a specific pair.

2. **Logic for Computing the Optimal Sum**:
   - The logic in `func_2` is flawed. The function is supposed to compute the maximum possible sum after Alice and Bob have made their optimal moves. However, the calculation of `pos` and the handling of sums do not correctly reflect the optimal strategy for both players.
   - Specifically, the function should consider the following:
     - Alice's optimal strategy is to remove the smallest `k` elements to maximize the remaining sum.
     - Bob's optimal strategy is to flip the smallest `x` elements (after Alice's removal) to minimize the sum.
   - The current code does not correctly implement this logic. For example, it incorrectly calculates the sum `n` and does not properly handle the flipping of elements.

3. **General Strategy**:
   - The correct approach involves sorting the array and considering different scenarios for removals and flips. Alice should remove the smallest elements, and Bob should flip the smallest elements of the remaining array.
   - The function should iterate through possible numbers of removals and flips, calculating the resulting sum for each scenario, and then choose the maximum sum.

Given these issues, the code does not correctly implement the problem's requirements and therefore is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
