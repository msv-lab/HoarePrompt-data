Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. It returns 0 if `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3. Otherwise, it returns the maximum value from a list `pos`, which contains `removals + 1` elements calculated based on the sums of specified subsets of `elements`.**
