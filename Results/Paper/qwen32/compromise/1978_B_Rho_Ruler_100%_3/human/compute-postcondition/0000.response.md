The code snippet assigns values to the variables `low` and `high`. The variable `low` is set to `0`, and `high` is set to the minimum value between `n` and `b`.

Given the initial state where `n`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, the value of `high` will be either `n` or `b`, whichever is smaller. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of buns, `a` is an integer representing the usual price of a bun, and `b` is an integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price. `low` is 0, `high` is `min(n, b)`.**
