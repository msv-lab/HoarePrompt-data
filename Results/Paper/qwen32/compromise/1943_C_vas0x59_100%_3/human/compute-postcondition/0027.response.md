The code snippet `n = previous[path_ba[-1]]` updates the value of `n` to be the value stored in the `previous` list at the index specified by the last element of the `path_ba` list. Given the initial state, `path_ba` contains only one element, which is `b`. Therefore, `n` is updated to `previous[b]`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree structure; `d` is a list where `d[i]` is the shortest distance from vertex `a` to vertex `i` in the tree; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex `a` to each vertex in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`; `n` is `previous[b]`.**
