The code snippet `ops.append((c1, i))` appends a new tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. This means that `ops` now includes the newly added tuple `(c1, i)`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree structure; `d` is a list where `d[i]` is the shortest distance from vertex `a` to vertex `i` in the tree; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex `a` to each vertex in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path, starting with `b` and ending with `a`, and must have at least 3 elements; `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, c2)` and the newly added tuple `(c2, i)`, and the newly added tuple `(c1, i)`, and now also contains the newly added tuple `(c1, i)`; the length of `path_ba` is even; `ci2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`; `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`; `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`; `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`; `i` is `i + 4`.**

In simple terms: The list `ops` has been updated to include an additional tuple `(c1, i)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
