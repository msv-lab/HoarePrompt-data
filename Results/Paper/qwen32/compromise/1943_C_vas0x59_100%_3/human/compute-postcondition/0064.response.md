The code snippet `ops.append((c2, i))` appends a new tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. This means that the list `ops` will now contain one additional element.

Given the initial state, the values of `c2` and `i` are already specified, and `ops` is a list that contains tuples of the form `(c1, c2)` and `(c2, i)`, along with `(c1, i)`. By appending `(c2, i)`, the list `ops` will simply have one more element added to it.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree structure; `d` is a list where `d[i]` is the shortest distance from vertex `a` to vertex `i` in the tree; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex `a` to each vertex in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path, starting with `b` and ending with `a`, and must have at least 3 elements; `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, c2)` and the newly added tuple `(c2, i)`, and the newly added tuple `(c1, i)`, and now also contains the newly added tuple `(c2, i)`; the length of `path_ba` is even; `ci2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`; `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`; `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`; `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`; `i` is `i + 2`.**
