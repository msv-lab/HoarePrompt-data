Reasoning:  
The given program is not guaranteed to find the integer \( y \) (1 \(\leq\) \( y \) < \( x \)) that maximizes the expression \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). The program simply selects \( y = \frac{x}{2} \) (integer division), which is not necessarily the optimal choice for all values of \( x \).

To illustrate this, let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:

- For \( x = 7 \), the correct \( y \) should be 6, because \(\gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7\), which is the maximum possible value.
- For \( x = 10 \), the correct \( y \) should be 5, because \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\), which is the maximum possible value.
- For \( x = 21 \), the correct \( y \) should be 18, because \(\gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 3 + 18 = 21\), which is the maximum possible value.
- For \( x = 100 \), the correct \( y \) should be 98, because \(\gcd(100, 98) + 98 = 2 + 98 = 100\), which is the maximum possible value.
- For \( x = 6 \), the correct \( y \) should be 3, because \(\gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6\), which is the maximum possible value.

However, the program always selects \( y = \frac{x}{2} \), which does not necessarily yield the maximum value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). For example, when \( x = 7 \), the program selects \( y = 3 \), which results in \(\gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4\), which is not the maximum possible value.

Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
