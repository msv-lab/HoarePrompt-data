### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem by using a sliding window approach combined with frequency counting. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and why it should be correct based on the problem statement:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Frequency Counting**:
   - The program uses the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each element in `b` (`b_freq`).
   - It also counts the frequency of each element in the first subarray of length `m` from `a` (`window_freq`).

3. **Initial Matches Calculation**:
   - The initial number of matches is calculated by summing up the minimum of the frequencies of each element that appears in both `window_freq` and `b_freq`.

4. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program then slides the window across `a` one element at a time.
   - For each new position of the window:
     - It checks if the current number of matches is at least `k`. If so, it increments the count of good subarrays.
     - It updates the count of matches by removing the contribution of the element that is sliding out of the window and adding the contribution of the new element that is sliding into the window.
     - It updates the `window_freq` accordingly, removing elements that have a frequency of zero.

5. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, it performs a final check for the last window position.

### Verification:

The program correctly implements the logic for counting good subarrays using a sliding window technique. It efficiently updates the count of matches as it slides through the array `a`, ensuring that the solution is optimal and works within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program adheres to the problem statement and correctly counts the number of good subarrays for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
