The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition, but based on the provided constraints and relationships, it is implied that it processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function returns a value for each test case based on the given list `a`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, the function returns a value based on the list `a`.**
