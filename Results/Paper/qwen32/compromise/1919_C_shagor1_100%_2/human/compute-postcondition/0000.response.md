The provided code snippet is simply `pass`, which does nothing in Python. Therefore, none of the variables `t`, `n`, or `a` are affected by this code. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.**
