### Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by checking if the array can be split into two parts such that swapping them results in a non-decreasing array. However, there are several issues with the logic:

1. **Initial Check**: The code first checks if the array is already non-decreasing. If it is, it correctly prints "YES".
2. **Incorrect Logic for Swapping**: If the array is not initially non-decreasing, the code tries to find a point where the array can be split into two parts `x` and `y` such that `y + x` is non-decreasing. The current logic is flawed because it only checks if the suffix (`new`) is non-decreasing and if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to all elements in the suffix. This is not sufficient to ensure that `y + x` is non-decreasing.

   Specifically, the condition `check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])` ensures that the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to all elements in the suffix, but it does not guarantee that the elements within the suffix are in non-decreasing order relative to the elements in the prefix when swapped.

3. **Break Statements**: The `break` statements inside the loop mean that once the first potential split is checked, the loop exits regardless of whether it was successful or not. This is incorrect because there might be other valid splits further down the array.

To fix the code, we need to ensure that the entire suffix is non-decreasing and that the last element of the suffix is less than or equal to the first element of the prefix when they are swapped. Additionally, we should iterate through all possible splits to find a valid one.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the current implementation is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
