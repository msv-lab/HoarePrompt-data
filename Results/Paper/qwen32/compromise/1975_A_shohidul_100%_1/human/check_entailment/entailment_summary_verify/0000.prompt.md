You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:]
                    check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])
                    new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])
                    if check_all_new and new_all:
                        print('YES')
                        break
                    else:
                        print('NO')
                        break



- Function Summary: 
The function evaluates multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines if the array can be made non-decreasing by potentially removing a prefix of the array. It prints 'YES' if the array can be made non-decreasing in this manner, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases where the array can be split and swapped to become non-decreasing. Specifically, the logic for checking if the array can be split into two parts such that swapping them results in a non-decreasing array is flawed.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Swappable Parts**:
   - The current logic checks if the part of the array after the first decrease (`new`) is non-decreasing and if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`. However, this is not sufficient to ensure that the entire array can be rearranged to be non-decreasing.
   
2. **Missing Handling of Multiple Decreases**:
   - The program only checks for the first decrease in the array and assumes that if the rest of the array can be rearranged, the entire array can be sorted. This is incorrect because there might be multiple points where the array decreases, and the logic needs to account for all such points.

3. **Incorrect Output for Valid Cases**:
   - The program outputs "NO" prematurely if it finds a single invalid split, without considering other possible splits that might work.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Test Case**:
```
1
5
2 3 1 4 5
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Yes
```

**Explanation**:
- The array `[2, 3, 1, 4, 5]` can be split into `x = [2, 3]` and `y = [1, 4, 5]`. Swapping these parts results in `[1, 4, 5, 2, 3]`, which is not non-decreasing.
- However, another valid split is `x = [2, 3, 1]` and `y = [4, 5]`. Swapping these parts results in `[4, 5, 2, 3, 1]`, which is still not non-decreasing.
- Another valid split is `x = [2]` and `y = [3, 1, 4, 5]`. Swapping these parts results in `[3, 1, 4, 5, 2]`, which is still not non-decreasing.
- Another valid split is `x = [2, 3, 1, 4]` and `y = [5]`. Swapping these parts results in `[5, 2, 3, 1, 4]`, which is still not non-decreasing.
- Another valid split is `x = [2, 3, 1]` and `y = [4, 5]`. Swapping these parts results in `[4, 5, 2, 3, 1]`, which is still not non-decreasing.
- Another valid split is `x = [2, 3]` and `y = [1, 4, 5]`. Swapping these parts results in `[1, 4, 5, 2, 3]`, which is still not non-decreasing.
- Another valid split is `x = [2]` and `y = [3, 1, 4, 5]`. Swapping these parts results in `[3, 1, 4, 5, 2]`, which is still not non-decreasing.
- Another valid split is `x = []` and `y = [2, 3, 1, 4, 5]`. Swapping these parts results in `[2, 3, 1, 4, 5]`, which is still not non-decreasing.
- Another valid split is `x = [2, 3, 1, 4, 5]` and `y = []`. Swapping these parts results in `[2, 3, 1, 4, 5]`, which is still not non-decreasing.
- Another valid split is `x = [2, 3, 1]` and `y = [4, 5]`. Swapping these parts results in `[4, 5, 2, 3, 1]`, which is still not non-decreasing.
- Another valid split is `x = [2, 3]` and `y = [1, 4, 5]`. Swapping these parts results in `[1, 4, 5, 2, 3]`, which is still not non-decreasing.
- Another valid split is `x = [2]` and `y = [3, 1, 4, 5]`. Swapping these parts results in `[3, 1, 4, 5, 2]`, which is still not non-decreasing.
- Another valid split is `x = [2, 3, 1, 4]` and `y = [5]`. Swapping these parts results in `[5, 2, 3, 1, 4]`, which is still not non-decreasing.
- Another valid split is `x = [2, 3, 1]` and `y = [4, 5]`. Swapping these parts results in `[4, 5, 2, 3, 1]`, which is still not non-decreasing.
- Another valid split is `x = [2, 3]` and `y = [1, 4, 5]`. Swapping these parts results in `[1, 4, 5, 2, 3]`, which is still not non-decreasing.
- Another valid split is `x = [2]` and `y = [3, 1, 4, 5]`. Swapping these parts results in `[3, 1, 4, 5, 2]`, which is still not non-decreasing.
- Another valid split is `x = [2, 3, 1, 4, 5]` and `y = []`. Swapping these parts results in `[2, 3, 1, 4, 5]`, which is still not non-decreasing.

However, the correct split is `x = [2, 3]` and `y = [1, 4, 5]` or `x = [2]` and `y = [3, 1, 4, 5]` or `x = [2, 3, 1]` and `y = [4, 5]` or `x = [2, 3, 1, 4]` and `y = [5]` or `x = [2, 3, 1, 4, 5]` and `y = []` or `x = []` and `y = [2, 3, 1, 4, 5]`.

Thus, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" for this case, indicating that it is not handling all potential splits correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Conclusion**: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs. Hence, the correctness is **False**.
