Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `new` is a list containing elements from index `i` to the end of `a`, `check_all_new` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`, `new_all` is `True` if each element in `new` is less than or equal to the next element in `new`, otherwise `new_all` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables remain unchanged except that we exit the most internal loop or if statement due to the `break` statement.
