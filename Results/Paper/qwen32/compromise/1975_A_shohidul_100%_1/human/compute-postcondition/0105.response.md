Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index `i` to the end of `a`.
- `check_all_new` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to each element in `new`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`.
- `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `new`, `check_all_new`, `new_all`). It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is always `'YES'`, regardless of the values of the variables described in the initial state.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
