Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50) representing the length of the array `a`, followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6) representing the elements of the array `a`. There are `t` such test cases.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    check_all = all([(a[i - 1] <= a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])
    if check_all:
        print('YES')
    else:
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                new = a[i:]
                check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))]
                    )
                new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len
                    (new))])
                if check_all_new and new_all:
                    print('YES')
                    break
                else:
                    print('NO')
                    break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order up to the `n-1` elements. If `check_all` is `True`, then `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order up to the `n-1` elements. If `check_all` is `False`, then `a` is not guaranteed to be sorted in non-decreasing order up to the `n-1` elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than or equal to 2; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is True if `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order up to the `n-1` elements, otherwise False. The value of `check_all` remains unchanged regardless of whether the if or else part is executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than or equal to 2; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a list of integers; `check_all` is True if `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order up to the `n-1` elements, otherwise False; `_` is 1; if `check_all` was initially False, then `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order and `i` is equal to `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
