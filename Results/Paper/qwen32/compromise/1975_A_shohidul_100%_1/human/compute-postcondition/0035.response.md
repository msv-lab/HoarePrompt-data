Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is greater than 5.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `check_all` is `False`.
- `i` is 5.
- `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index 5 to the end.
- `check_all_new` is `True` if `a[0] >= new[i]` for all `i` in the range of `len(new)`, otherwise `False`.
- `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('YES')` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`. None of the variables mentioned in the initial state (`t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `i`, `new`, `check_all_new`, `new_all`) are used in this print statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

### Conclusion:
The output of the print statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
