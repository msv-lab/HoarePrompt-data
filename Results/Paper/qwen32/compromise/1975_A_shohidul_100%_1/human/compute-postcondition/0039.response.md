Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is greater than 5; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is `False`; `i` is 5; `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index 5 to the end; `check_all_new` is `True` if `a[0] >= new[i]` for all `i` in the range of `len(new)`, otherwise `False`; `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. Regardless of whether `check_all_new` and `new_all` are `True` or `False`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
