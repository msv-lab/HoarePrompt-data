Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is `False`. At the current index `i`, if `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then `new` is a list containing elements from `a[i:]`. If both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are `True`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False` (or both), and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.**
