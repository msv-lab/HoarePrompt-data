Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `check_all` is `False`.
- `i` is 4.
- `new` is a list containing elements from index 4 to the end of `a`.
- `check_all_new` is `True` or `False` depending on whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`.
- `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet directly outputs the string `'NO'`. This output does not depend on any of the variables or their values described in the initial state. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `i`, `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all` do not influence the output of this specific `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
