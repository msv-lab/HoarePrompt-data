Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is False, `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end of the list. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both True, then all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]` and non-decreasing. Otherwise, either `check_all_new` is False or `new_all` is False. In both cases, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
