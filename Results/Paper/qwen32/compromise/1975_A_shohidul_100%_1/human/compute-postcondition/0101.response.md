To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is greater than or equal to 2
- `n` is greater than 1
- `a` is a list of integers
- `_` is 1 (though this variable does not seem to be used in the loop head and thus can be ignored for this purpose)
- `check_all` is a boolean indicating if the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order up to the `n-1` elements
- `new` is a list created from index `i` to the end of `a` if `check_all` becomes False
- `check_all_new` and `new_all` are booleans used for additional checks on `new`

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value between 1 and `n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` remains unchanged as it defines the upper limit of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `t` remains greater than or equal to 2
- `n` remains greater than 1
- `a` remains the same list of integers
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value
- The values of `check_all`, `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all` depend on the conditions met in the previous iteration but remain unchanged for the purpose of adjusting the loop head variables.

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**
