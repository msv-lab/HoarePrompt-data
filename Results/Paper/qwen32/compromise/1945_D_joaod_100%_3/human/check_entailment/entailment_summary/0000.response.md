### Reasoning:

The provided Python program seems to attempt to solve the problem by iterating through the list of people in the queue from the end towards the beginning and calculating the minimum cost for Kirill to reach his desired position `m`. However, there are some issues with the logic of the program that suggest it might not be correct.

1. **Cost Calculation Logic**: 
   - The program keeps track of a `total` cost which is supposed to accumulate the costs as Kirill moves through the queue.
   - The `best` variable is intended to keep track of the minimum cost to reach a position <= `pos_final` (m-1, since positions are 0-indexed).
   - However, the logic of adding costs (`total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]`) seems flawed. The cost `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is the cost to swap with the person at position `v`, and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` is the cost to pay to the person at position `v` when Kirill is moving past them. The program does not correctly account for the fact that Kirill can choose to swap with any `j` such that `j < i` and pay `b_k` for all `k` such that `j < k < i`. The program simply adds the cost of swapping or passing without considering the optimal choice of `j`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where `m = 1` or `m = n` correctly. For example, if `m = 1`, Kirill needs to be at the front of the queue, and the program should consider all possible swaps to reach the front.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - A correct approach would involve using a priority queue or a greedy algorithm to keep track of the minimum cost to reach each position up to `m`. The idea would be to always swap with the person who has the minimum cost to move Kirill closer to the front, considering the costs `a` and `b` appropriately.

Given the issues with the cost calculation logic and the lack of a clear strategy to find the optimal sequence of swaps, the provided program is likely incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
