You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`, and two lists `a` and `b` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum cost to reach a specified position `m` from the start, considering the costs defined in lists `a` and `b`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis

Kirill is at the end of a queue and wants to move up to be among the first `m` people. He can bribe people in front of him to swap places. For each swap, he pays `a_i` coins to the person he swaps with and `b_k` coins to every person between them.

### Logic of the Program

The program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of people in the queue (`na_frente`) and the maximum allowable final position for Kirill (`pos_final`).
3. It reads the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`.
4. It initializes `total` to 0, which will keep track of the total cost.
5. It initializes `best` to a very large number, which will store the minimum cost to reach a position within the first `m` positions.
6. It iterates through the queue from the last person to the first person:
   - If the current person is within the first `m` positions and the cost to swap with this person plus the total cost is less than `best`, it updates `best`.
   - It adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total` for each person.
7. It prints the value of `best` for each test case.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
   - The program incorrectly adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total` for each person, regardless of whether Kirill actually swaps with them or not. This is incorrect because Kirill should only add `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` when he swaps with the person at position `v`, and `custo_pra_passar_b[k]` for all `k` between the positions he swaps.

2. **Logic for `best` Update**:
   - The program updates `best` whenever it finds a position `v` within the first `m` positions, but it doesn't consider the cost of passing by the people between the current position and `v`.

3. **Handling of `pos_final`**:
   - The program correctly adjusts `pos_final` to be zero-based, but it doesn't handle the case where `pos_final` is the last position correctly.

### Correctness

Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a position within the first `m` positions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
