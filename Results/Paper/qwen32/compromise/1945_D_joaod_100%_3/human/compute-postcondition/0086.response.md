Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `cases` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 1, `na_frente` is an integer as read from the input minus 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer as read from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers as read from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers as read from the input, `c` is `c + 1`, `v` is `v - 1`. If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. `total` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

In simple terms, the `total` has been increased by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. All other variables remain unchanged unless `best` was greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, in which case `best` has been updated to this new `total`.
