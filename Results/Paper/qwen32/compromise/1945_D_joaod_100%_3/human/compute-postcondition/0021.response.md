Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `cases` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 1; `na_frente` is an integer as read from the input minus 1 (and must be at least 0); `pos_final` is an integer as read from the input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers as read from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers as read from the input; `total` is `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`; `best` is `sys.float_info.max`; `v` is greater than `pos_final`; `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`**

In this state, the value of `total` has been updated to be equal to `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
