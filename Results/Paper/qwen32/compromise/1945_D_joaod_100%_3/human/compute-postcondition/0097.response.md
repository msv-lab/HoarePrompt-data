The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string components, converts each of these components to an integer, and stores them in a list named `custo_pra_trocar_a`. This operation does not affect the values of `c`, `cases`, `na_frente`, or `pos_final`.

Output State: **`c` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `cases` must be greater than the new value of `c`, `na_frente` is an integer from the input, `pos_final` is an integer from the input, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers from the input.**
