Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `cases` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 1; `na_frente` is an integer as read from the input minus 1; `pos_final` is an integer as read from the input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers as read from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers as read from the input.**

In simpler terms, `pos_final` has been decremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
