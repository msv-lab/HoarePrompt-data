Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `cases` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 1, `na_frente` is an integer as read from the input minus 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer as read from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers as read from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers as read from the input, `c` is `c + 1`, `v` is `v - 1`, `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`**

In simple terms, the output state is that the variable `best` is now equal to the sum of `total` and the element at index `v` of the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`. All other variables retain their initial values except for `c` and `v`, which have been updated to `c + 1` and `v - 1`, respectively.
