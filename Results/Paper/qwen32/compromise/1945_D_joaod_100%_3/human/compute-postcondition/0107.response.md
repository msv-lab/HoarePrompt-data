Postcondition: **`c` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `cases` must be greater than the new value of `c`, `na_frente` must be at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer from the input decremented by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers from the input, `total` is 0, `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Otherwise, `best` remains unchanged.**
