Postcondition: **`num` is 0, `iterable` is 4, `loop` is greater than 4, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `big` is an empty list, `less` is a list containing `a`, and `no` is an empty list. Otherwise, `big` and `less` are empty lists, and `no` is a list containing `a`.**
