The value of `num` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is `min(less) - max(big)` (since `num` was initially `min(less) - max(big) + 1`), `iterable` is 4, `loop` is greater than 4, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `big` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 1, `less` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 2, `no` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is the next element in the list `no` after `i_current`.

Output State: **`num` is `min(less) - max(big)`, `iterable` is 4, `loop` is greater than 4, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `big` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 1, `less` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 2, `no` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is the next element in the list `no` after `i_current`.**
