Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, constraints are represented by distinct pairs (a, x) where a is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, `loop` is greater than 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer read from input, `a` is the second integer read from input, `iterable2` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `iterable2` at the end of the previous iteration. If `x` equals 2, `less` contains the value of `a` appended to it. Otherwise, `no` is a list containing its previous elements plus the value of `a`.**
