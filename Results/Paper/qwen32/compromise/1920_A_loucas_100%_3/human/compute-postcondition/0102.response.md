The given code snippet is:

```python
no = []
```

This line of code reassigns the list `no` to an empty list. None of the other variables (`num`, `iterable`, `loop`, `innerLoop`, `big`, `less`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1 - countInRange`, `iterable` is 4, `loop` must be greater than 4, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `big` is [], `less` is [], `no` is []**.
