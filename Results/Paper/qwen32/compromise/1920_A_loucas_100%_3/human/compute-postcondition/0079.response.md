Postcondition: **`num` is 0, `iterable` is 3, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is greater than 2, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `big` is a list containing `a` if `x` is 1, an empty list if `x` is 2, or an empty list otherwise, `less` is a list containing `a` if `x` is 2, an empty list if `x` is 1, or an empty list otherwise, `no` is a list containing `a` if `x` is neither 1 nor 2, and `iterable2` is 3.**
