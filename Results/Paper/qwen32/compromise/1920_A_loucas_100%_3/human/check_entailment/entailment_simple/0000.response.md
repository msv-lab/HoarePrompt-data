### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement and the annotated states.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it initializes three lists: `less`, `big`, and `no` to store constraints of types 2, 1, and 3 respectively.

2. **Reading Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, the program reads the type `a` and the value `x`.
   - Depending on the type `a`, it appends `x` to the appropriate list (`big` for type 1, `less` for type 2, `no` for type 3).

3. **Calculating Initial Range**:
   - The program calculates the initial number of possible values for `k` using the formula `num = min(less) - max(big) + 1`. This formula correctly computes the number of integers between the smallest upper bound (`min(less)`) and the largest lower bound (`max(big)`), inclusive.

4. **Adjusting for "Not Equal" Constraints**:
   - If the calculated `num` is less than 1, it means there are no integers that satisfy both the lower and upper bounds, so it prints `0` and continues to the next test case.
   - Otherwise, it iterates through the `no` list and subtracts 1 from `num` for each value in `no` that falls within the range `[max(big), min(less)]`.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the adjusted `num` for each test case.

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the program with the first example test case:

- **Constraints**: 
  - `1 3` (k ≥ 3)
  - `2 10` (k ≤ 10)
  - `3 1` (k ≠ 1)
  - `3 5` (k ≠ 5)

- **Processing**:
  - `big` = [3]
  - `less` = [10]
  - `no` = [1, 5]
  - `num = min(less) - max(big) + 1 = 10 - 3 + 1 = 8`
  - Adjustments for `no`:
    - `1` is not in the range [3, 10], so `num` remains 8.
    - `5` is in the range [3, 10], so `num` becomes 7.

- **Result**: The program outputs `7`, which matches the expected result.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
