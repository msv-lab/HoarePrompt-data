The code snippet subtracts `p[a - 2]` from `s`. Given the initial state, `s` is initially set to `p[b - 1]`. After the operation, `s` will be `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is `m - 1` and must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the new input, `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.**
