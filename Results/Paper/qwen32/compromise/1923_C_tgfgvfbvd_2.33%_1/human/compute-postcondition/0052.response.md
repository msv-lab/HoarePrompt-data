The code snippet `c += x` increments the value of `c` by the value of `x`. Given the initial state, `c` was initially 0, and `x` is the next element in the list `l`. After executing the code, `c` will be equal to `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `p` is a list containing the integer 0, `c` is `x`, `x` is the next element in `l`.**
