The only object in the loop head is the variable `x`, which iterates over the list `l`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how `x` changes.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (no change needed).
- `n` is the first integer read from the input (no change needed).
- `m` is the second integer read from the input (no change needed).
- `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 2 integers (no change needed).
- `p` is a list containing the value of `c` and the new value `c + 2*x` (no change needed as this is a result of the previous iteration).
- `c` is `c + x + x` (no change needed as this is a result of the previous iteration).
- `x` is the next element in `l` (this needs to be updated).

Since `x` is the current element being processed in the loop, at the start of the next iteration, `x` should be the next element in the list `l`. If `x` was the first element in the previous iteration, it should now be the second element, and so on.

Let's assume that in the previous iteration, `x` was the `k`-th element of the list `l`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `x` should be the `(k+1)`-th element of the list `l`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 2 integers, `p` is a list containing the value of `c` and the new value `c + 2*x`, `c` is `c + x + x`, `x` is the next element in `l`**.

To be more specific, if `x` was the first element in the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `x` should be the second element of `l`. If `x` was the second element in the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `x` should be the third element of `l`, and so on.

Given the information, let's assume `x` was the first element in the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `x` should be the second element of `l`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 2 integers, `p` is a list containing the value of `c` and the new value `c + 2*x`, `c` is `c + x + x`, `x` is the second element in `l`**.
