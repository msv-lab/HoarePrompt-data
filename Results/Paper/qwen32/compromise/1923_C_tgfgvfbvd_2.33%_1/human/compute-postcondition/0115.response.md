The code snippet `s -= p[a - 2]` modifies the value of `s` by subtracting `p[a - 2]` from it. Given that `s` was initially `p[b - 1]`, the new value of `s` will be `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `n` remains the first integer read from the input.
- `m` remains the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0.
- `l` remains a list of integers read from the input.
- `p` remains a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `c` remains the sum of all elements in `l`.
- `a` and `b` remain the two integers read from the new input.
- `s` is now `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the new input, `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.**
