The only variable in the loop head is `x`, which iterates over the list `l`. Therefore, we need to adjust `x` to the next element in the list `l` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `n` is the first integer read from the input.
- `m` is the second integer read from the input.
- `l` is a list of integers with at least two elements.
- `p` is a list containing the integers 0 and `n`.
- `c` is `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` would have taken the value of the first element in the list `l`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` should now take the value of the second element in the list `l`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `l` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `p` is a list containing the integers 0 and `n`, `c` is `n`, `x` is the second element in the list `l`**
