The given Python code snippet contains only a single `print` statement:

```python
print('YES')
```

This `print` statement outputs the string `'YES'` directly. The initial state provides several variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, and `s`) and their relationships, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the content of the `print` statement itself.

Output: **YES**
