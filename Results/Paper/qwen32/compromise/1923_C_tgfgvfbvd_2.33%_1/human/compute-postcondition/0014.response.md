To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables `c` and `p` based on the list `l`. The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `l`, adds `x` to the cumulative sum `c`, and appends the updated value of `c` to the list `p`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 10^4 (not modified by the loop).
   - `n`: The first integer read from the input (not modified by the loop).
   - `m`: The second integer read from the input (not modified by the loop).
   - `l`: A list of integers (not modified by the loop).
   - `p`: An initially empty list.
   - `c`: An integer initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each element `x` in `l`, the following operations occur:
     - `c` is incremented by `x`.
     - The new value of `c` is appended to the list `p`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `c` will hold the sum of all elements in `l`.
   - The list `p` will contain the cumulative sums after each iteration, starting from the first element up to the last.

Let's denote the elements of `l` as `l[0], l[1], ..., l[k-1]`, where `k` is the length of `l`. The final state will be:
- `c` will be equal to the sum of all elements in `l`, i.e., `c = l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[k-1]`.
- `p` will be a list containing the cumulative sums, i.e., `p = [l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[k-1]]`.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, and `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.**

In simpler terms, `c` will be the total sum of the list `l`, and `p` will be a list of running totals as each element of `l` is added sequentially.
