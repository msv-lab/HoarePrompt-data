The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, and `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input.**
