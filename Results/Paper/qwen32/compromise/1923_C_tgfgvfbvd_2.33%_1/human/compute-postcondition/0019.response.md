The code snippet subtracts `p[a - 2]` from `s`. Given the initial state, `s` is initially `p[b - 1]`. After the operation, `s` becomes `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.

Therefore, the updated value of `s` is the difference between the cumulative sum up to the `b-1` index and the cumulative sum up to the `a-2` index in the list `p`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, and `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input; `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Additionally, `a` is at least 2.**
