Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `l` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `p` is a list containing the integers 0 and `n`, `c` is `n + x`, `x` is the second element in the list `l`.**

Natural Language: The value of `c` has been updated to be the sum of its previous value (`n`) and the value of `x` (which is the second element in the list `l`). All other variables remain unchanged.
