The code snippet provided assigns the value of `p[b - 1]` to the variable `s`. This means that the value of `s` will now be the element at index `b - 1` in the list `p`.

Given the initial state, the following variables remain unchanged:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `n` is the first integer read from the input.
- `m` is `m - 1` and must be greater than 0.
- `l` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
- `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the new input.

The only change is the value of `s`, which is now set to `p[b - 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is `m - 1` and must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the new input, `s` is `p[b - 1]`.**
