Let's analyze the given program to see if it correctly determines whether a subarray is "good" according to the problem statement.

### Problem Recap:
A subarray is considered "good" if there exists another array `b` such that:
1. The sum of elements in the subarray equals the sum of elements in `b`.
2. No element in the subarray is equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
3. All elements in `b` are positive.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the prefix sums of the array `c` and stores them in the list `p`. This allows for efficient calculation of the sum of any subarray.
   
2. **Processing Queries**:
   - For each query, the program calculates the sum of the subarray using the prefix sums.
   - It then checks if the sum of the subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray (`s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`).
   - If the condition is met, it prints "YES", otherwise "NO".

### Checking the Condition:
- The condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` is derived from the need to ensure that we can construct an array `b` where each element is different from the corresponding element in the subarray and still maintains the same sum.
- If the sum of the subarray is at least twice its length, it is possible to construct such an array `b` by assigning values to `b` such that each `b[i]` is either `1` or `c[i] + 1` (or some other value ensuring `b[i] > 0` and `b[i] != c[i]`).

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
