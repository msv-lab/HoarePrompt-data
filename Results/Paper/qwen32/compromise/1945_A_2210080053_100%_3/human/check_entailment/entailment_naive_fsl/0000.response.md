Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Tents for Extroverts and Universals:**
   The program combines the number of extroverts and universals (`b += c`) and then attempts to calculate the number of tents needed for them by using integer division (`-b // 3`). However, this approach does not respect the requirement that each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two others. It also does not properly account for the remaining participants after placing introverts and extroverts in tents.

2. **Handling of Remainders:**
   The program uses a conditional expression to return `-1` if `c < b % 3`. This condition is not correctly checking if the remaining participants can be accommodated. For example, if there are leftover extroverts that cannot form a group of three, the program should check if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   The program does not handle cases where there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots after placing introverts and extroverts. For example, if there are 1 introvert, 2 extroverts, and 1 universal, the program should return `-1` because the extroverts cannot be paired with each other and there is not enough universals to form a group of three with the extroverts.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:
- Input: `1 2 1`
- Expected Output: `3` (1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for the extrovert and universal, and 1 tent for the remaining universal)
- Program Output: `2` (Incorrect, as it does not properly handle the remaining universal)

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
