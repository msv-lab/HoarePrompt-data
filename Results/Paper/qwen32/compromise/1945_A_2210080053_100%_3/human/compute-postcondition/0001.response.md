To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand what the loop does in each iteration. 

The loop reads each line of input (after the first line which contains the number of test cases), splits it into three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, and then performs the following operations:
1. It adds `c` to `b`.
2. It calculates the value of `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` and prints it.
   - The expression `-b // 3` computes the integer division of `-b` by `3`.
   - The expression `b % 3` computes the remainder of `b` divided by `3`.
   - The expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` is a tuple where the first element is `a - -b // 3` and the second element is `-1`. The expression evaluates to the first element if `c < b % 3` is `False` (i.e., `c >= b % 3`), and to the second element if `c < b % 3` is `True`.

After processing each test case, the loop prints the result of the expression for that test case.

Since the loop processes each test case independently and prints the result immediately, the final state of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` after the loop finishes is not retained. The only output is the series of printed results for each test case.

Therefore, the output state is simply the series of printed results for each test case, which is not stored in any variables but is instead output directly.

Output State: **The output state consists of the series of printed results for each test case, which are the values of the expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` for each test case.**
