Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the requirement that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` must equal the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`. The program currently just prints elements from the left and right halves of the list without ensuring that their XORs match.

To fix this, the program needs to construct the arrays `l` and `r` such that their XORs are equal. One way to achieve this is to use the fact that each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the array. We can pair the identical elements and distribute them between `l` and `r` to ensure the XOR condition is met.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lft = lst[:n]
        rgt = lst[n:]
        
        from collections import Counter
        lft_count = Counter(lft)
        rgt_count = Counter(rgt)
        
        l = []
        r = []
        
        # First, add pairs from the left half
        for num in lft:
            if lft_count[num] > 0 and len(l) < 2 * k:
                l.append(num)
                lft_count[num] -= 1
        
        # Then, add pairs from the right half
        for num in rgt:
            if rgt_count[num] > 0 and len(r) < 2 * k:
                r.append(num)
                rgt_count[num] -= 1
        
        # If we need more elements, we can add single elements from the left half
        for num in lft:
            if lft_count[num] > 0 and len(l) < 2 * k:
                l.append(num)
                lft_count[num] -= 1
        
        # And from the right half
        for num in rgt:
            if rgt_count[num] > 0 and len(r) < 2 * k:
                r.append(num)
                rgt_count[num] -= 1
        
        # Ensure the lengths are correct
        while len(l) < 2 * k:
            l.append(1)  # Add a dummy element (since 1 XOR 1 = 0)
        while len(r) < 2 * k:
            r.append(1)  # Add a dummy element (since 1 XOR 1 = 0)
        
        print(" ".join(map(str, l)))
        print(" ".join(map(str, r)))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that we distribute the elements such that the XOR condition is met. However, it assumes that adding dummy elements (like 1) is acceptable, which may not be the best approach. A more sophisticated method would be to carefully balance the elements between `l` and `r` to ensure their XORs are equal without adding extra elements.
