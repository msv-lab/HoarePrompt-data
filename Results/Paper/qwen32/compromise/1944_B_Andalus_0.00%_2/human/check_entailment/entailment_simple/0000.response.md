### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by dividing the given array into two halves and then constructing the arrays `l` and `r` based on the criteria provided. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases `T`. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k` and the array `a` of length `2n`.

2. **Splitting the Array**: The array `a` is split into two halves: `lft` (the first `n` elements) and `rgt` (the last `n` elements).

3. **Identifying Duplicates and Singles**:
   - `ldb` stores elements that appear twice in `lft`.
   - `rdb` stores elements that appear twice in `rgt`.
   - `sng` stores elements that appear only once in `lft`.

4. **Constructing `l` and `r`**:
   - The program first tries to add pairs of duplicate elements from `ldb` to `l` and `r` until it reaches `k` elements or runs out of duplicates.
   - If more elements are needed to reach `k`, it adds elements from `sng` to both `l` and `r`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the constructed arrays `l` and `r`.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Handling Duplicates**: The program correctly identifies and adds pairs of duplicate elements to both `l` and `r`. Since these pairs are identical, their XOR will be zero, which is useful in ensuring the final XOR of `l` and `r` match.
  
- **Handling Singles**: If `k` is odd or there are not enough duplicates to fill `l` and `r` to length `2k`, the program adds single elements from `sng` to both `l` and `r`. This ensures that the XOR of elements in `l` and `r` can still match.

- **Correctness of XOR**: Since the XOR of a number with itself is zero, the pairs of duplicates contribute a zero to the XOR sum. The remaining elements added from `sng` are the same in both `l` and `r`, ensuring their XORs are equal.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly constructs the arrays `l` and `r` such that their XORs are equal and they meet the subset criteria. Given the problem constraints and the logic of the program, it should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

**Correctness: True**
