Output State: **`lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `ldb` contains at least two elements that have duplicates immediately before them, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have duplicates immediately before or after them, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately before them, `n` and `k` are assigned the values provided by the input, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order, `sz` and `elem` remain unchanged because a `break` statement was encountered.**

In simpler terms: The values of `lft`, `ldb`, `sng`, `rdb`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, and `rgt` remain the same. The `break` statement does not affect these variables. The variables `sz` and `elem` also remain unchanged.
