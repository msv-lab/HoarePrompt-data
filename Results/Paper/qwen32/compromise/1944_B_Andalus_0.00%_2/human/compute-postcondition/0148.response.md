To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses and affects the variables `ldb` and `sng`.

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`. For each iteration, it checks if the current element `lft[i]` is equal to the previous element `lft[i - 1]`. If they are equal, it appends `lft[i]` to `ldb`. Otherwise, if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]` (and `i < n - 1`), it appends `lft[i]` to `sng`.

After all iterations, `i` will have taken on all values from `1` to `n - 1`. This means that the loop will have checked all adjacent pairs in `lft` up to the second-to-last element.

### Output State Analysis:
- **`ldb`**: Contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately before them.
- **`sng`**: Contains all elements in `lft` that are neither the same as the element before them nor the same as the element after them, except for the last element.

### Final Output State:
- `lft` remains unchanged as it is only used for comparison.
- `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element.
- `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are unique in their immediate neighborhood (not the same as the element before them or the element after them).

Given the loop's behavior, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element, and `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all iterations:
- `lft` stays the same.
- `ldb` has all elements that are duplicates of the previous element in `lft`.
- `sng` has all elements in `lft` that are unique among their immediate neighbors.
