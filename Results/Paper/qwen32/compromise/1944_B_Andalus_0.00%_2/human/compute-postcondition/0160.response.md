The given code snippet is:

```
sz = 0
```

This code simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `sz`. The other variables `lft`, `ldb`, and `sng` remain unchanged as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors, `sz` is 0.**
