To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's carefully analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `sz` can be either 0, 2, or 4.
- `sng` is a list, and all elements up to the initial value of `sz` have been printed.
- `rdb` is a list with more than one element.
- If `sz` is 4, then `k - sz` must be greater than or equal to 2.
- If `sz` is not greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is not broken out of. Otherwise, it is broken out of.
- `elem` is the next element in `rdb`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, and the `end=' '` parameter ensures that no newline character is added after the print statement, allowing the next print statement to continue on the same line.
- The value of `elem` is the next element in the list `rdb`. Since `rdb` has more than one element, `elem` is well-defined and is the next element to be processed in `rdb`.

### Output:
Since `elem` is the next element in `rdb`, and it is printed twice, the output will be `elem elem` (where `elem` is the next element in the list `rdb`).

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the next element in the list `rdb`)**
