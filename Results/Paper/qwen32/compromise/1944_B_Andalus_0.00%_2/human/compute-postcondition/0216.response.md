Output State: **`rdb` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the next element from `rdb` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not change the values of `rdb` or `elem`. Therefore, `rdb` still must contain at least one element, and `elem` is still the next element from `rdb`.
