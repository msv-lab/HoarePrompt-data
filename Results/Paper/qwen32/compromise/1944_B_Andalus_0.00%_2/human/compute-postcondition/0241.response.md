The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `lst`. None of the other variables (`lft`, `ldb`, `sng`, `rdb`, `sz`, `n`, `k`) are directly affected by this code snippet.

Given the initial state, the variables `lft`, `ldb`, `sng`, `rdb`, `sz`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The new variable `lst` is introduced and assigned the list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors, `rdb` remains unchanged, `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus the number of elements printed from `sng`, `n` and `k` are assigned the values provided by the input, `lst` is a list of integers from the input.**
