To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`lft`**: This list remains sorted and unchanged.
2. **`ldb`**: This list contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element.
3. **`sng`**: This list contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors and must have at least 3 elements.
4. **`sz`**: This variable is the minimum of `2 * len(ldb)` or `k` plus 2.
5. **`elem`**: This variable is the third element in the `sng` list.

Given the print statement `print(elem, end=' ')`, the output will be the third element of the `sng` list, followed by a space. Since we do not have the exact contents of `lft`, `ldb`, or `sng`, we can describe the output in terms of the `sng` list.

Output: **elem (where elem is the third element in the list `sng`)**
