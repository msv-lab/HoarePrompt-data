Output State: **`rdb` must not be empty; `sz` is increased by 2; if `sz` is now greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.**

In natural language, the `sz` variable has been incremented by 2. The condition to break out of the most internal loop or if statement is now dependent on the new value of `sz`. If this new value of `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop or if statement will be exited. The `rdb` variable remains unchanged and must still not be empty.
