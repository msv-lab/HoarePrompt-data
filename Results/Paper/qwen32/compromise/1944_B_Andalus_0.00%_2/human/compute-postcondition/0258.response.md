The code snippet `ldb.append(lft[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lft` to the list `ldb`. Given that `i` is 4, the element `lft[4]` is appended to `ldb`. 

Since `ldb` initially contains `lft[i]` if `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, and now an additional element `lft[4]` is being appended, `ldb` will now include `lft[4]` regardless of whether it was equal to `lft[3]` or not, as the condition for appending is no longer checked after this operation.

The other variables (`lft`, `sng`, `rdb`, `sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `rgt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order; `ldb` is a list containing `lft[i]` if `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]` plus `lft[4]`; `sng` is a list containing `lft[i]` if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, otherwise `sng` is an empty list; `rdb` is an empty list; `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus the number of elements printed from `sng`; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is assigned the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers from the input; `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order; `i` is 4**.
