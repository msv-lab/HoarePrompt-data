To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `rdb` must not be empty.
- There is a condition involving `sz` and `k`, but it does not directly affect the `print` statement. The condition is: If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.
- The `print` statement is `print(elem, elem, end=' ')`.

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement prints the variable `elem` twice, separated by a space, and does not end with a newline (due to `end=' '`).
- The variable `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but based on the context, it is likely an element from the `rdb` list or another relevant data structure that is being iterated over or processed in the code (not shown here).

### Conclusion:
Since `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can only describe its value in terms of its role in the code. Assuming `elem` is an element from `rdb` (as `rdb` is the only list mentioned and must not be empty), the print statement will output the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is an element from the rdb list)**
