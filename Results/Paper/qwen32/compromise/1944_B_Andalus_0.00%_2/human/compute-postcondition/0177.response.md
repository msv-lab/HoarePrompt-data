Postcondition: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element and must have at least 2 elements, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors. If `sz` is initially increased by 2 (when `k - sz` was initially greater than or equal to 2), otherwise `sz` remains unchanged. `elem` is the next element in `ldb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
