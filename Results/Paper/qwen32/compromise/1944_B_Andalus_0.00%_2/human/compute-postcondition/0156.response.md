The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 4, and `n` must be greater than 4.

State: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element plus `rgt[i]` if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors, and `n` must be greater than 4. `i` is 4. If `rgt[4]` is equal to `rgt[3]`, `rdb` has `rgt[4]` appended to it.**
