To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the information given in the initial state and analyze the variables involved.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`lft`**: This list remains sorted and unchanged.
2. **`ldb`**: This list contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element and must have at least 2 elements.
3. **`sng`**: This list contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors.
4. **`sz`**: This variable is initially increased by 2 if `k - sz` was initially greater than or equal to 2, otherwise it remains unchanged.
5. **`elem`**: This variable is the next element in `ldb`.
6. **Condition for exiting**: If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

### Analyzing the Print Statement:
- The `print` statement is printing `elem` twice, separated by a space, and does not move to a new line after printing (due to `end=' '`).

### Determining the Value of `elem`:
- `elem` is defined as the next element in `ldb`, which contains duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element.
- Since `ldb` contains duplicates, `elem` will be one of these duplicate elements.

### Output Description:
- The output will be `elem` printed twice, separated by a space.
- The exact value of `elem` is not specified, but it is known to be an element that appears consecutively in `lft`.

### Final Output:
Output: **elem elem (where elem is a duplicate element from lft that appears consecutively)**
