The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the loop statement `for i in range(1, n):`, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 5, and `n` must be greater than 5.

State: **`lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order; `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately before them; `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have duplicates immediately before or after them; `rdb` contains the element `rgt[i]` if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, and if `rgt[4] == rgt[3]`, `rdb` also includes `rgt[4]`; `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus the number of elements printed from `sng`; `n` is at least 5; `k` is assigned the value provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers from the input; `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order; `i` is 5.**
