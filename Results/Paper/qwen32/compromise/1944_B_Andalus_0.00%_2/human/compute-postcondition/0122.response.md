The code provided reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `lst`. This operation does not affect the previously mentioned variables `sng`, `sz`, `T`, `n`, or `k`.

Output State: **All elements of `sng` up to the index `min(k, len(sng)) - 1` are printed, `sz` is equal to `min(k, len(sng))`, `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input.**
