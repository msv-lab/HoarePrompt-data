Output State: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element and must have at least 1 element, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors, `sz` is 0, and `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables `lft`, `ldb`, `sng`, `sz`, and the condition `sz >= k` remain unchanged. The code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
