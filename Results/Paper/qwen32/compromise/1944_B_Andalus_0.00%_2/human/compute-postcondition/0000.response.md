The code snippet reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `T`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, but the variable `t` is not directly affected by the code snippet. Instead, a new variable `T` is introduced and assigned the value of the input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `T` is the input integer representing the number of test cases.**
