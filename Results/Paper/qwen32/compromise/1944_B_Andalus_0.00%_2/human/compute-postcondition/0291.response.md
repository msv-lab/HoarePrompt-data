To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and understand the context in which the `print` statement is executed.

### Initial State Recap:
1. **`lft`**: The first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
2. **`ldb`**: Contains at least two elements that have duplicates immediately before them.
3. **`sng`**: Contains all elements in `lft` that do not have duplicates immediately before or after them.
4. **`rdb`**: Contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately before them.
5. **`n` and `k`**: Assigned values provided by the input.
6. **`lst`**: A list of integers from the input.
7. **`rgt`**: `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order.
8. **Loop Control**: If `sz >= k`, the loop or if statement is broken out of. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is increased by 2 and `elem` is the next element in `ldb`.

### Key Focus:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

From the description, we know:
- **`elem`**: This variable is assigned to the next element in `ldb` when the condition `k - sz >= 2` is met.

### Understanding `elem`:
- `ldb` is a list that contains elements from `lft` which have duplicates immediately before them. Since `ldb` contains at least two such elements, `elem` will be one of these elements.

### Output Analysis:
- The `print` statement prints `elem` twice, separated by a space, and does not end with a newline (due to `end=' '`).

### Conclusion:
Since `elem` is an element from `ldb` which contains elements with duplicates immediately before them, the exact value of `elem` cannot be determined without the specific values of `lst` and `n`. However, based on the provided information, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **elem elem (where elem is an element from ldb, which contains elements with duplicates immediately before them in lft)**
