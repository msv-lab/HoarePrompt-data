In the provided task, the for loop iterates over `rdb`. Therefore, the only state that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is the state of `rdb`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the loop variable and iterable**: The loop variable is `elem`, and the iterable is `rdb`.
2. **Determine the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute if `rdb` contains at least one element.
3. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop executes, `rdb` must have at least one element. The states of `lft`, `ldb`, `sng`, and `sz` do not affect whether the loop executes, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors, `sz` is 0, `rdb` must contain at least one element**
