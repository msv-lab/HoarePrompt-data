To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and understand the variables involved.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` and `T` are integers within the range of 1 to 5000, but their specific values are not relevant for this print statement.
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, sorted in ascending order.
- `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`, sorted in ascending order.
- `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them and must have at least two elements.
- `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately preceding them.
- `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are unique and not at the boundaries.
- `elem` is the third element in `ldb`.
- `sz` is a variable that determines the flow of the loops and conditions, but its exact value is not provided for this specific print statement.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```
This statement will print the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, without a newline at the end.

### Determining the Value of `elem`:
- `elem` is defined as the third element in `ldb`.
- `ldb` contains elements from `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them and must have at least two elements.

Given this, `elem` is a specific integer that appears at least twice consecutively in the sorted list `lft`.

### Output:
Since we don't have the specific values of `lst`, `lft`, and `ldb`, we can only describe `elem` in terms of its definition.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the third element in the list `ldb`, which contains elements from `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them and must have at least two elements)**
