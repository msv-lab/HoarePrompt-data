The only variable in the loop head of the given `for` loop is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` for the next iteration. The loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value between `1` and `n-2` (inclusive), because the loop will execute while `i` is less than `n`.
2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000
- `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000
- `n` is an integer greater than 1
- `k` is the second integer from the input
- `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order
- `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order
- If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` contains `lft[i]` (which is equal to `lft[i - 1]`), and `rdb` and `sng` are empty lists.
- If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is an empty list, and if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, `sng` contains `lft[i]`; otherwise, `sng` is an empty list.
- `rdb` remains an empty list.

Since only `i` can be adjusted, we increment `i` by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `i` is incremented by 1, `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng` are determined based on the new value of `i` as per the loop logic**
