Output State: **`rdb` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the next element from `rdb` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `rdb` and `elem` remain unchanged. The only change is that the program execution will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
