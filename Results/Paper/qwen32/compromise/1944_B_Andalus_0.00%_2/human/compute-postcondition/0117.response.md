Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `sng` is a list with at least two elements.
- `sz` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `k`.
- `elem` is the next element in the list `sng`.
- If `sz` is not less than `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no further action is taken regarding the loop or if statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- `elem` is the next element in the list `sng`. Since `sng` is a list with at least two elements, `elem` will be the current element being processed in the list.
- The `print` statement will output the value of `elem` followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` argument), and it will not start a new line after printing `elem`.

### Output:
Since `elem` is the next element in the list `sng`, the output will be the value of `elem` followed by a space. However, without knowing the exact value of `elem` from the list `sng`, we can only describe the output in terms of `elem`.

Output: **elem (where elem is the next element in the list `sng`)**
