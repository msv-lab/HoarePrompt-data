The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k` respectively. This operation does not affect the variables `sng`, `sz`, or `T` directly. The initial state mentions that `sz` is equal to `min(k, len(sng))` and `T` is `T - 1`, but since `k` is being reassigned, `sz` will need to be recalculated in a subsequent context where `k` is used. However, based on the given code and initial state, we only update `n` and `k`.

Output State: **All elements of `sng` up to the index `min(k, len(sng)) - 1` are printed, `sz` is equal to `min(k, len(sng))`, `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input.**
