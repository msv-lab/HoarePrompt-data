The code snippet `sng.append(lft[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lft` to the list `sng`. This means that `sng` will have an additional element, which is `lft[i]`.

Given the initial state:
- `lft` is a list
- `i` is `i + 2`
- `n` remains the same
- If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` has an additional element which is `lft[i]`. Otherwise, if `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` has an additional element `lft[i]` appended to it.

After the execution of `sng.append(lft[i])`, the list `sng` will have `lft[i]` as an additional element. The other conditions and values of `lft`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged unless further operations are performed.

Output State: **`lft` is a list, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` remains the same, `sng` has an additional element `lft[i]` appended to it**.
