The code snippet contains a `break` statement, but the condition `sz >= k` is not met, so the `break` statement does not affect the execution flow in this context. The values of `sng`, `sz`, `elem`, and the condition `sz < k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sng` is a list with at least three elements; `sz` is incremented by 2 but is still less than `k`; `elem` is the third element of `sng`. Since the condition `sz >= k` is not met, the code does not break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
