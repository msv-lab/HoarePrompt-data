To determine what will be printed when the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement executes, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the context in which `elem` is used.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`lft`**: This list remains sorted and unchanged.
2. **`ldb`**: This list contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element.
3. **`sng`**: This list contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors and must have at least one element.
4. **`sz`**: This variable is the minimum of `2 * len(ldb)` or `k`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no additional changes occur.

### Key Points:
- The code snippet provided is `print(elem, end=' ')`. This means `elem` will be printed followed by a space, and the cursor will not move to a new line after printing.
- The variable `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but based on the context, it is likely that `elem` is an element from one of the lists (`lft`, `ldb`, or `sng`).

### Analysis:
To determine the exact value of `elem`, we need to consider the context in which this `print` statement is placed. Since the context is not provided, we can only infer that `elem` is being printed within a loop that iterates over one of the lists (`lft`, `ldb`, or `sng`).

### Conclusion:
Given the information, `elem` could be any element from `lft`, `ldb`, or `sng` depending on the loop context. However, the exact element cannot be determined without additional context. Therefore, the most precise description we can provide is that `elem` is an element from one of these lists.

Output: **elem (where elem is an element from one of the lists `lft`, `ldb`, or `sng`)**
