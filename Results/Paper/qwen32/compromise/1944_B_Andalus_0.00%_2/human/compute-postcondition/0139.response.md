The code snippet `ldb.append(lft[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lft` to the list `ldb`. Given that `i` is `i + 1` from the initial state, we need to consider the new value of `i` when appending the element. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`lft` is a list, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains the same, `ldb` has an additional element which is `lft[i]`.**

In natural language: The list `ldb` now includes an additional element, which is the element at the index `i` of the list `lft`. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `n` has not changed.
