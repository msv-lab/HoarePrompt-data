To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the context in which the print statement is executed.

### Initial State:
1. `sng` is a list with at least one element.
2. There is a condition involving `sz` and `k` that might affect the flow of the program, but it does not directly impact the print statement itself.
3. The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement is present, indicating that `elem` is a variable that holds some value.

### Analysis:
- The print statement `print(elem, end=' ')` suggests that `elem` is a variable whose value is to be printed, followed by a space.
- The value of `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, which means we need to infer its value based on the context in which it is used.
- Since `elem` is used in the print statement, it is likely that `elem` is an element from the list `sng` or a variable that holds a value derived from `sng`.

### Inference:
- Given that `sng` is a list and there is no specific information about how `elem` is assigned, we can assume that `elem` is an element from `sng` that is being iterated over or processed in some way.
- Without additional context about how `elem` is assigned, we cannot determine the exact value of `elem`. However, we can describe the output in terms of `elem`.

### Output:
The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem`, followed by a space. Since the exact value of `elem` is not provided, we describe it as an element from the list `sng`.

Output: **elem (where elem is an element from the list `sng`)**
