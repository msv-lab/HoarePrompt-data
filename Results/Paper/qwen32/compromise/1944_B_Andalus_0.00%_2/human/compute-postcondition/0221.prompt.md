Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors, and `sz` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for elem in rdb:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    if k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors, `rdb` must contain at least one element. If `k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is now `sz + 2` (where `sz + 2` is greater than or equal to `k + 2` or `2` if `sz` was initially less than `k`). Otherwise, `sz` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `rdb` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the next element from `rdb`. If `k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is increased by 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no additional changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `rdb` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the next element from `rdb`. If `k - sz >= 2`, `sz` is incremented by 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to `rdb` or `elem`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
