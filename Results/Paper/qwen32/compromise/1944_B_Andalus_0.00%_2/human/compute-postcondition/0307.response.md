The only variable in the loop head is `elem`. Therefore, we need to adjust `elem` to ensure the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have duplicates immediately before or after them and must have at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must still have at least one element, and `elem` should be the next element in `sng`.

Let's denote the current `elem` as the `i`-th element of `sng`. For the next iteration, `elem` should be the `(i+1)`-th element of `sng`.

State: **`lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order; `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately before them; `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have duplicates immediately before or after them and must have at least 1 element; `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately before them; `n` and `k` are assigned the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers from the input; `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order; `sz` is the smallest multiple of 2 that is equal to or greater than `k` plus 1. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `elem` is the next element in `sng`.**

Since we do not have the specific elements of `sng`, we can only describe the state in terms of the next element in `sng`.
