To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, let's carefully analyze the provided initial state and the given code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `sng` is a list with at least two elements.
2. `sz` is incremented by 1.
3. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- **`sng`**: This is a list with at least two elements. However, the specific elements of the list are not provided in the initial state.
- **`elem`**: This variable is not explicitly defined in the provided initial state. It is likely that `elem` is an element from the list `sng` that is being iterated over or processed in some loop.
- **`sz` and `k`**: These variables are involved in a condition that might break a loop if `sz` is incremented and reaches `k`. However, their exact values or the context of the loop are not provided.

Since `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can assume that `elem` is a variable that holds the current element of the list `sng` in some loop iteration. For example, if there is a loop iterating over `sng`, `elem` would take on the value of each element in the list one by one.

### Conclusion:
The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` followed by a space, without moving to a new line. Since the specific value of `elem` is not provided, we can describe it as the current element being processed in the iteration over the list `sng`.

### Output:
Output: **elem (where elem is the current element being processed in the iteration over the list `sng`)**
