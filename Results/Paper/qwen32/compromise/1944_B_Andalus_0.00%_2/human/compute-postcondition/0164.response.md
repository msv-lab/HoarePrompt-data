Postcondition: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element and must have at least 1 element, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors, `sz` is 0. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute the else part (which is not specified in this case).**
