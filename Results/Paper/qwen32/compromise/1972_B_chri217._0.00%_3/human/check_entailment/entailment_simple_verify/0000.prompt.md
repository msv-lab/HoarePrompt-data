You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program: 
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[1])
    s = data[2]
    print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    num_up = s.count('U')
    if num_up % 2 == 1:
        return 'YES'
    else:
        return 'NO'



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[1])
    s = data[2]
    print(func_1(s))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of 'U' and 'D' characters, representing the initial state of the coins on the table, where 'U' indicates a coin facing up and 'D' indicates a coin facing down. The length of the string s is a positive integer n such that 1 <= n <= 100.
def func_1(s):
    num_up = s.count('U')
    if (num_up % 2 == 1) :
        return 'YES'
        #The program returns 'YES'
    else :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins ("U" in the string). Here's a breakdown of why this is correct:

1. **Game Analysis**: The game revolves around the number of facing-up coins. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position. This is because each move reduces the number of facing-up coins by an odd number (either 1 or 3, depending on the configuration). Thus, if Alice starts with an odd number of facing-up coins, she can always ensure that Bob faces an even number of facing-up coins on his turn, eventually leading to Bob's loss.

2. **Even Facing-Up Coins**: Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that Alice faces an even number of facing-up coins on her turn. This strategy will eventually lead to Alice's loss.

3. **Implementation**: The program simply counts the number of 'U's in the string `s` and checks if this count is odd or even. If it's odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when there is only one coin (`n=1`). If this coin is facing up ("U"), Alice wins (`YES`), and if it's facing down ("D"), Bob wins (`NO`).

Since the program correctly captures the winning strategy based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins, it works for all potential cases described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
