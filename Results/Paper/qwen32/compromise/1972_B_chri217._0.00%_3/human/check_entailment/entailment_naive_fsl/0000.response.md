Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins ("U" in the string). Here's a breakdown of why this is correct:

1. **Game Analysis**: The game revolves around the number of facing-up coins. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position. This is because each move reduces the number of facing-up coins by an odd number (either 1 or 3, depending on the configuration). Thus, if Alice starts with an odd number of facing-up coins, she can always ensure that Bob faces an even number of facing-up coins on his turn, eventually leading to Bob's loss.

2. **Even Facing-Up Coins**: Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that Alice faces an even number of facing-up coins on her turn. This strategy will eventually lead to Alice's loss.

3. **Implementation**: The program simply counts the number of 'U's in the string `s` and checks if this count is odd or even. If it's odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when there is only one coin (`n=1`). If this coin is facing up ("U"), Alice wins (`YES`), and if it's facing down ("D"), Bob wins (`NO`).

Since the program correctly captures the winning strategy based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins, it works for all potential cases described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
