### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` to determine if they correctly solve the problem as described.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: To determine the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
- **Logic**:
  - If `extroverts` is divisible by 3, it means all extroverts can be accommodated in tents of 3, and any remaining universals can be used to fill up any leftover spots.
  - If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, the remainder when `extroverts` is divided by 3 represents the number of additional people needed to fill the last tent. If this remainder is 1 or 2, the function checks if there are enough universals to fill the tent.
  - If the remainder plus the number of universals is less than 3, it is impossible to form a valid tent, and the function returns `None`.
  - Otherwise, it calculates the total number of tents needed by dividing the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3 and rounding up to ensure all people are accommodated.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: To determine the total number of tents required for all participants.
- **Logic**:
  - It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
  - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it is impossible to accommodate extroverts and universals according to their preferences, so `func_2` returns -1.
  - Otherwise, it adds the number of tents needed for introverts (which is equal to the number of introverts, as each introvert needs their own tent) to the result from `func_1` and returns the sum.

### Verification:
Let's verify the correctness of the solution with the provided examples:

1. **Input**: `1 2 3`
   - `func_1(2, 3)`:
     - `extroverts % 3 == 2` and `2 + 3 >= 3`, so it returns `ceil((2 + 3) / 3) = 2`.
   - `func_2(1, 2, 3)`:
     - `ret = 2`, so it returns `1 + 2 = 3`.
   - **Output**: `3` (Correct)

2. **Input**: `1 4 1`
   - `func_1(4, 1)`:
     - `extroverts % 3 == 1` and `1 + 1 < 3`, so it returns `None`.
   - `func_2(1, 4, 1)`:
     - `ret = None`, so it returns `-1`.
   - **Output**: `-1` (Correct)

3. **Input**: `1 4 2`
   - `func_1(4, 2)`:
     - `extroverts % 3 == 1` and `1 + 2 >= 3`, so it returns `ceil((4 + 2) / 3) = 2`.
   - `func_2(1, 4, 2)`:
     - `ret = 2`, so it returns `1 + 2 = 3`.
   - **Output**: `3` (Correct)

4. **Input**: `1 1 1`
   - `func_1(1, 1)`:
     - `extroverts % 3 == 1` and `1 + 1 >= 3`, so it returns `ceil((1 + 1) / 3) = 1`.
   - `func_2(1, 1, 1)`:
     - `ret = 1`, so it returns `1 + 1 = 2`.
     - But the correct output should be `-1` because we cannot form a tent with 1 extrovert and 1 universal.
     - This indicates an issue with the logic in `func_1` for this specific case.

### Conclusion:
Upon closer inspection, we see that `func_1` does not handle the case where `extroverts % 3 == 1` and `universals == 1` correctly. The function should return `-1` in such cases because it's impossible to form a valid tent.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
