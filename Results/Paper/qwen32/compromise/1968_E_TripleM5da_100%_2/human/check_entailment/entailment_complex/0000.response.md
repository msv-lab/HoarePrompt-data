Reasoning:

The given program is intended to handle multiple test cases where for each test case, an integer `n` is provided, and the program needs to output `n` points on an `n x n` grid that maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of points.

Let's analyze the program's behavior and correctness:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.

2. **Output Strategy**:
   - The program prints the point `(1, 1)`.
   - It then prints the point `(1, 2)`.
   - For all subsequent points (from 3 to `n`), it prints points of the form `(i, i)`.

3. **Effectiveness of the Strategy**:
   - The point `(1, 1)` provides a baseline.
   - The point `(1, 2)` introduces a Manhattan distance of `1` from `(1, 1)`.
   - Points `(i, i)` for `i` from `3` to `n` introduce increasing Manhattan distances from `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, and also from each other.

However, the strategy does not maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances. Specifically:
- The program only places points on the main diagonal and two specific points, which is not a strategy that guarantees the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances.
- For example, with `n = 3`, the program outputs `(1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3)`, resulting in Manhattan distances of `{0, 1, 2, 3}`. But, as shown in the problem statement, the arrangement `(2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1)` achieves Manhattan distances `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`, which is better.

Given the above analysis, the program does not always produce the optimal solution for maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\).

Correctness: **False**
