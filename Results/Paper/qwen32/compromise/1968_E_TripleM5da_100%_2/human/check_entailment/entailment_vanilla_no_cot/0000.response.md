Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not always maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of \(n\). The program outputs a fixed pattern for each \(n\), starting with points (1,1) and (1,2), and then adding points (i,i) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n\). This pattern does not guarantee that the number of distinct Manhattan distances will be maximized.

For example, consider \(n=3\). The program will output the points (1,1), (1,2), and (3,3). The Manhattan distances between these points are:
- Between (1,1) and (1,2): 1
- Between (1,1) and (3,3): 4
- Between (1,2) and (3,3): 3

So, \(\mathcal{H} = \{1, 3, 4\}\), which has a size of 3. However, as shown in the problem statement, the optimal arrangement for \(n=3\) is (2,1), (2,3), and (3,1), which gives \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), a set of size 4.

Thus, the program does not always produce the optimal solution and is therefore incorrect.
