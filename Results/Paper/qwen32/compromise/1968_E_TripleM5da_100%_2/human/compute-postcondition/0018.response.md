In the given initial state, we have the following information:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `i` is explicitly set to 3.
- `n` must be at least 3.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(i, i)
```

Here, the variable `i` is explicitly given the value 3. Therefore, when the `print(i, i)` statement is executed, it will output the value of `i` twice.

Output: **3, 3**
