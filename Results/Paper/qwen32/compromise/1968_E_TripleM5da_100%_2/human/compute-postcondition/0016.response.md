Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` must be at least 3.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(i, i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly given a value of 0.
- The variable `t` and `n` are mentioned in the initial state, but they are not used in the print statement.
- The print statement `print(i, i)` will output the value of `i` twice.

### Conclusion:
Since `i` is 0, the print statement will output 0, 0.

### Output:
Output: **0, 0**
