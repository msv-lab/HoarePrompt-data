The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop variable `i` starts at 3 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 4. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4**
