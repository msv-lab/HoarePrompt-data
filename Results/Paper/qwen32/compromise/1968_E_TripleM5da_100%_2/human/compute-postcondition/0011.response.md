Let's analyze the given problem step by step.

The loop provided is:
```python
for i in range(0, int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the problem statement, we know the following:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `i` is `n + 1`, where `n` is the input value.

The `for` loop iterates over the range from `0` to `int(input()) - 1`. This means that `i` will take values starting from `0` up to `n-1`.

Given that `i` is `n + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it implies that the loop has just finished executing because `i` has exceeded the maximum value that the loop would have assigned to it, which is `n-1`.

To execute the loop one more time, `i` must be reset to `0` (the starting value of the range) and the loop condition must be satisfied, which means `n` (the input value) must be greater than `0`.

Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted, we need to reset `i` to `0` for the loop to start again.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 0, `n` is the input value**
