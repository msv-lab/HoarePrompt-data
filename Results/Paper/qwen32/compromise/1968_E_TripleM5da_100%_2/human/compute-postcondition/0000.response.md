To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute if `int(input())` returns a value greater than 0. Given the context, `int(input())` corresponds to the variable `n` in the problem description.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute if `int(input())` (which is `n`) is greater than 0.
2. According to the problem description, `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 10^3`. This ensures that `n` will always be greater than 0, so the loop will execute.
3. The variable `i` is the loop variable and is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop. We don't need to adjust `i` before the loop starts because it is automatically set by the `range` function.

The state before the loop starts is already sufficient to ensure that the loop will execute because `n` is guaranteed to be in the range `[2, 10^3]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the following t lines, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3**
