The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Given the initial state, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the following `t` lines, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^3. After executing the code, `n` will be updated to the integer value provided by the input, but `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and `n` is the integer value provided by the input, where 2 <= `n` <= 10^3.**
