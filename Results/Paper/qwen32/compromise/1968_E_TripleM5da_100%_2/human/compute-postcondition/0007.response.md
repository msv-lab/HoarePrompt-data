Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

- **Initial State**:
  - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50
  - `i` is 5
  - `n` must be at least 3

- **Python Code Snippet**:
  ```python
  print(i, i)
  ```

From the initial state, we know that `i` is explicitly defined as 5. The print statement is asking to print the value of `i` twice.

Since `i` is 5, the print statement will output the value 5 twice.

Output: **5 5**
