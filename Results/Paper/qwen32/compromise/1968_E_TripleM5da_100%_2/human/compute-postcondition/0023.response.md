Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is `n` + 1, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` reassigns the variable `n` to the value of the input, which is converted to an integer. The value of `i` is updated to be `n + 1` based on this new value of `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged.
