### Reasoning:
The problem requires finding the optimal position to place a road dividing the village into left and right sides such that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied with their side preference. The optimal position is the one that minimizes the absolute difference between the middle of the village and the position of the road, with ties broken by choosing the smaller position.

**Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
- Reads the number of houses `n` and the string `a` representing the preferences of the residents.
- Constructs a cumulative count array `S` where `S[i]` contains the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to the `i`-th house.
- Iterates through each possible position `i` to check if placing the road after the `i`-th house satisfies the conditions:
  - At least half of the '0's are on the left side of the road.
  - At least half of the '1's are on the right side of the road.
- If a valid position is found, it checks if it is closer to the middle of the village than the previously found positions, updating the answer accordingly.
- Prints the optimal position `i`.

**Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
- Handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The logic in `func_1` correctly iterates through all possible positions to check the conditions.
- The cumulative count array `S` is used efficiently to determine the number of '0's and '1's on either side of the road at any position `i`.
- The condition checks (`left * 2 < lsum` and `right * 2 < rsum`) ensure that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
- The answer is updated based on the condition that minimizes `|n/2 - i|`, and ties are broken by choosing the smaller `i`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description and handles multiple test cases efficiently. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
