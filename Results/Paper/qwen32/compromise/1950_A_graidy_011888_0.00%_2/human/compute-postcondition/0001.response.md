The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop condition is `i <= 1000`. Given that `i` is 1 right before the loop, the condition `i <= 1000` is already satisfied.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9; `i` is 1**
