The code snippet `removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` performs a heap push followed by a heap pop. This means that `item` is added to the heap, and then the smallest element in the heap is removed and assigned to `removed_item`.

Given the initial state, `heap` contains `item`. After executing the code, `item` is pushed onto `heap`, making `heap` contain two instances of `item` temporarily. Then, the smallest element in `heap` is popped out and assigned to `removed_item`. Since `heap` initially contained only one `item`, and `item` is pushed again, the smallest element (which is `item`) will be popped out.

Thus, `removed_item` will be equal to `item`. The `heap` will still contain one instance of `item` because the push and pop operations effectively replace the original `item` with the new `item` pushed.

The other variables (`k`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `remaining_items`, `test_cases`, `combined`, `current_profit`, `max_profit`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` contains the `item`; `k` is 0; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is greater than 0; `combined` is not an empty list (excluding the last element); `item` is the second-to-last element that was in `combined` before the pop operation; `removed_item` is equal to `item`; if `removed_item` is truthy, `current_profit` is decreased by `item[0]`; `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`. If `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is decreased by `item[1]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]`.**
