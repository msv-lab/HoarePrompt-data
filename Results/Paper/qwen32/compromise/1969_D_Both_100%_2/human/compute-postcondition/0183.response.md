The code snippet `current_profit -= item[1]` decreases the value of `current_profit` by the second element of the tuple `item`.

Given the initial state, `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined`, and `item[1]` refers to the second element of that tuple. Therefore, `current_profit` is reduced by this value.

All other variables remain unchanged except for `current_profit`.

Output State: **`heap` contains `item` and the smallest element from the original `heap` is replaced by `item`; `removed_item` is the smallest element from the original `heap`; `combined` contains at least one more tuple (one less than before); `n` is `n_value`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and still greater than 0; `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined`; `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - item[1]`; `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.**
