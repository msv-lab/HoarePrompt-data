The code snippet `n, k = func_2()` indicates that the function `func_2()` returns two values which are then assigned to the variables `n` and `k`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are integers representing the number of items and the number of items Bob can take for free respectively, and given that `func_2()` presumably returns these values, the new values of `n` and `k` will be whatever `func_2()` returns.

The other variables (`heap`, `remaining_items`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, `combined`, and `test_cases`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of integers representing the prices of items for Alice, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, `bonuses` is a list of integers representing the bonuses Alice receives from selling items to Bob, `max_profit` is an integer representing the maximum profit Alice can achieve, `current_profit` is an integer representing the current profit Alice has, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the negative price and bonus of an item, `test_cases` must be greater than 0.**
