Postcondition: **`heap` contains the last `k` elements of the original `combined` list in the order they were popped; `k` is 0; `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `remaining_items`, `test_cases` remain unchanged. If `combined` is not empty, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`. Otherwise, `current_profit` remains unchanged. Additionally, `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`.**
