The given code snippet simply assigns the value of `current_profit` to `max_profit`. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`heap` contains the `item`; `k` is 0; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is greater than 0; `combined` is not an empty list (excluding the last element); `item` is the second-to-last element that was in `combined` before the pop operation; `removed_item` is equal to `item`; `current_profit` is unchanged; `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`.**
