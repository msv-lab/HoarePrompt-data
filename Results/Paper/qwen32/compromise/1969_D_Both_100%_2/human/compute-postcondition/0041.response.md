The code snippet assigns the value of `current_profit` to `max_profit`. This means that the value of `max_profit` is now updated to whatever `current_profit` was at the time of assignment. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`heap` contains the last `k` tuples from the original `combined` list in the order they were popped (which is still 0, so it remains empty); `k` is 0; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is greater than 0; `combined` has one less element than before; `item` is the last element that was in `combined`; `removed_item` is equal to `item`. If `removed_item` is truthy, `current_profit` is reduced by `removed_item[0]`. Additionally, `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit` (before the assignment); `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit`.**
