The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `k` times. Therefore, the only state that directly affects whether the loop can execute is `k`.

For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0. The other variables mentioned (`heap`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `remaining_items`, `test_cases`, `combined`, `current_profit`, and `max_profit`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`heap` is an empty list; `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()` and must be greater than 0; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is greater than 1; `combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple; `current_profit` is 0; `max_profit` is 0.**
