The code snippet `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())` removes the last tuple from the `combined` list and pushes it onto the `heap`. Given the initial state, `combined` originally had one more tuple than it does now, and `heap` contained the last tuple from the original `combined` list if `combined` was non-empty.

After executing the code:
- `heap` now contains the last tuple from the original `combined` list (which was already there) and the new last tuple from the updated `combined` list (which was just removed).
- `combined` has one less tuple than it did initially.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` contains the last tuple from the original `combined` list and the new last tuple from the updated `combined` list; `k` is `k_value - 2` and must be greater than 0; `combined` is a list of tuples with one less tuple than before if `combined` was non-empty; `n` is `n_value`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and still greater than 0; `current_profit` is 0; `max_profit` is 0.**
