Postcondition: **`heap` contains the previously last element of `combined` (if `combined` was not empty before) plus the new last element of `combined` after the pop operation if `combined` is not empty. If `combined` is empty, `heap` remains unchanged. `combined` has one less element than before if it was not empty. `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()` minus 1 and must be greater than 0. `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`. `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`. `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `remaining_items` is an empty list. `test_cases` is greater than 1. `current_profit` is 0. `max_profit` is 0.**
