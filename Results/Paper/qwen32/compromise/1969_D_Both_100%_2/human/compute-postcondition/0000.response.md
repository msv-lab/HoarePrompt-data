The given code snippet is `test_cases = func_1()`. This line of code calls a function named `func_1()` and assigns its return value to the variable `test_cases`. None of the other variables mentioned in the initial state are directly affected by this line of code.

Since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine the exact value or type of `test_cases`. However, we can infer that `test_cases` will hold whatever value `func_1()` returns.

Output State: **`heap` is a list that will be used as a min-heap, `remaining_items` is a list that may store items not yet processed, `n` is an integer representing the number of items, `k` is an integer representing the number of items Bob can take for free, `prices` is a list of integers representing the prices of items for Alice, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, `bonuses` is a list of integers representing the bonuses Alice receives from selling items to Bob, `max_profit` is an integer representing the maximum profit Alice can achieve, `current_profit` is an integer representing the current profit Alice has, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the negative price and bonus of an item, `test_cases` holds the return value of `func_1()`.**
