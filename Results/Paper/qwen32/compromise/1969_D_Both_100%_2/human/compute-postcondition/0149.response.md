Postcondition: **`heap` contains the last tuple from the original `combined` list and, if `combined` was non-empty, also the new last tuple from the updated `combined` list. `k` is `k_value - 2` and must be greater than 0. `combined` is a list of tuples with one less tuple than before if `combined` was non-empty. `n` is `n_value`. `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`. `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `remaining_items` is an empty list. `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and still greater than 0. `current_profit` is 0. `max_profit` is 0.**
