The code snippet creates a list of tuples called `combined` by zipping together the `neg_prices` list and the `bonuses` list. This means each tuple in `combined` will contain a pair of elements, one from `neg_prices` and one from `bonuses` at the same index.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `combined`. All other variables retain their original states.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the negative price and bonus of an item, `test_cases` must be greater than 0.**
