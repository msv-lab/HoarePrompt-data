The code snippet sets `remaining_items` to an empty list. This affects only the `remaining_items` variable, while all other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list; `k` is the number of iterations (equal to the original length of `combined`); `combined` is empty; `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and still greater than 0; `current_profit` is the net profit after processing all items; `max_profit` is the maximum profit encountered during the loop.**
