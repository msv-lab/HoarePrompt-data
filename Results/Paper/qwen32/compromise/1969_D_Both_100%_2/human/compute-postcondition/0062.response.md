Postcondition: **`heap` contains the `item`; `k` is 0; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is greater than 0; `combined` is not an empty list (excluding the last element); `item` is the second-to-last element that was in `combined` before the pop operation; `removed_item` is equal to `item`; `current_profit` is unchanged; `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit` before the if-else block.**
