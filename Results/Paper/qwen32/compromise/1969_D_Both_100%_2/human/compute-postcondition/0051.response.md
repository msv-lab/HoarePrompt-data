Output State: **`heap` contains the `item`; `k` is 0; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is greater than 0; `combined` is an empty list; `item` is the last element that was in `combined`; `removed_item` is equal to `item`; if `removed_item` is truthy, `current_profit` is decreased by `item[0]`; `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is the addition of the variable `max_profit`, which is assigned the value of `current_profit`. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions.
