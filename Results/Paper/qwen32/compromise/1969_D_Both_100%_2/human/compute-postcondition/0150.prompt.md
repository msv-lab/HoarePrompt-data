Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `heap` is an empty list; `k` is `k_value`; `combined` is a list of tuples formed by zipping `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple; `n` is `n_value`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and still greater than 0; `current_profit` is 0; `max_profit` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(k):
    if combined:
        heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `heap` contains the last tuple from `combined` if `combined` is non-empty; `k` is `k_value` and must be greater than 0; `combined` is a list of tuples with one less tuple if `combined` was non-empty; `n` is `n_value`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and still greater than 0; `current_profit` is 0; `max_profit` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `heap` contains the last tuple from the original `combined` list if `combined` was non-empty; `k` is `k_value - 1` and must be greater than 0; `combined` is a list of tuples with one less tuple than before if `combined` was non-empty; `n` is `n_value`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and still greater than 0; `current_profit` is 0; `max_profit` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `heap` contains the last tuple from the original `combined` list and, if `combined` was non-empty, also the new last tuple from the updated `combined` list. `k` is `k_value - 2` and must be greater than 0. `combined` is a list of tuples with one less tuple than before if `combined` was non-empty. `n` is `n_value`. `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`. `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `remaining_items` is an empty list. `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and still greater than 0. `current_profit` is 0. `max_profit` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
