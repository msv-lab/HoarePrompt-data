Postcondition: **`heap` contains the previously last element of `combined` (if `combined` was not empty before) plus the new last element of `combined` after the pop operation if `combined` is not empty; `combined` has one less element than before if it was not empty; `k` is 1; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is greater than 1; `current_profit` is 0; `max_profit` is 0. If `combined` is empty, none of these changes occur.**
