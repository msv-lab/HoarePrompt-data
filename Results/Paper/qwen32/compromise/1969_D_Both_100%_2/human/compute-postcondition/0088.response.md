To determine the output state, we need to understand the effect of the line `current_profit = func_3(combined, heap)` on the existing variables. Given that `func_3` is a function that takes `combined` and `heap` as arguments and returns a value which is then assigned to `current_profit`, we need to consider what `func_3` does.

Since the exact implementation of `func_3` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific value that `current_profit` will take. However, we know that `current_profit` will be updated to whatever value `func_3` returns.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the only variable that changes is `current_profit`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` contains the last `k` elements of the original `combined` list in the order they were popped; `combined` is not empty; `k` is 0; `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `remaining_items`, `test_cases`, `max_profit` remain unchanged; `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`.**
