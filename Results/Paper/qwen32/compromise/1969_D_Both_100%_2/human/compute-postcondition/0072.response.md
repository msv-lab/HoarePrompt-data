Output State: **`heap` is an empty list; `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is greater than 1; `combined` is an empty list; `current_profit` reflects the net profit after processing all items; `max_profit` is 0.**

Explanation: The only change made by the code is that `max_profit` is explicitly set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
