Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

# Annotated Functions:

read_input = sys.stdin.readline
func_4()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature. This function does not have any parameters and thus no preconditions can be derived from the signature alone.
def func_1():
    return int(read_input())
    #The program returns an integer value that is the result of converting the input read by `read_input()` to an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_2`.
def func_2():
    return map(int, read_input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that applies the int function to each element of the list obtained by splitting the string returned from read_input().
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes no input parameters and returns a map object. This map object contains integers, which are derived by converting each element of a list. The list is created by splitting a string obtained from the `read_input()` function.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: primary_items is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the price of an item for Alice and Bob respectively. secondary_heap is a list of tuples with the same structure as primary_items, representing items that have been considered and possibly optimized for in a previous step.
def func_3(primary_items, secondary_heap):
    total = sum(item[0] for item in secondary_heap)
    for item in primary_items:
        if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
            total += item[0] + item[1]
        
    #State: primary_items
    return total
    #The program returns the value of `total`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the total value by summing up the prices of items from both `primary_items` and `secondary_heap`, considering only those items from `primary_items` where the sum of the prices for Alice and Bob is non-negative.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: heap is a list that will be used as a min-heap, remaining_items is a list that may store items not yet processed, n is an integer representing the number of items, k is an integer representing the number of items Bob can take for free, prices is a list of integers representing the prices of items for Alice, neg_prices is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, bonuses is a list of integers representing the bonuses Alice receives from selling items to Bob, max_profit is an integer representing the maximum profit Alice can achieve, current_profit is an integer representing the current profit Alice has, combined is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the negative price and bonus of an item.

        print(max_profit)
        
    #State: heap is an empty list; k is the number of items Bob can take for free; n is the number of items from the last test case; prices is the list of prices from the last test case; neg_prices is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in prices from the last test case; bonuses is the list of bonuses from the last test case; remaining_items is an empty list; test_cases is 0; combined is an empty list; current_profit reflects the net profit after processing all items from the last test case; max_profit holds the maximum profit encountered across all test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and prints the maximum profit Alice can achieve by selling items to Bob, considering the prices of the items, the bonuses Alice receives, and the fact that Bob can take up to `k` items for free. It processes multiple test cases, each with its own set of items, prices, and bonuses, and outputs the maximum profit for each test case.
