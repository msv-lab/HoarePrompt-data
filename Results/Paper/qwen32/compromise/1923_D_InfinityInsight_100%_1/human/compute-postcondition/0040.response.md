The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1. Since the loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n)`, the next value of `i` should be the next integer, which is 2.

None of the other variables (`a`, `n`, `left`, `ans`, `last`, `x`, `inx`, `inx2`) are part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is at least 2, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0` and ending with the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times except `ans[i]` which is `i + 1 - inx` if `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`, `last` is a list of length `n` where each element after the first is either the index `i` where a change was observed or the last index where a change was observed, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`, and `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`. If `inx` is less than `0`, the values of `inx` and `inx2` remain unchanged, `i` is 2**
