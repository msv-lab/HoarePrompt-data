The provided code snippet initializes a list named `left` with a single element, `0`. This assignment does not affect the variables `a` or `n`. The variable `a` remains a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, and `n` remains the integer representing the number of slimes, which is the length of `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, and `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n = len(a)` and `1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5`. Each element in `a` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`. `left` is a list containing a single element `0`.**
