Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a list `a` of integers representing the sizes of slimes and an integer `n` representing the number of slimes, where `n` is the length of `a` and each element in `a` is between 1 and 10^9. The function returns a list `ans` where each element at index `i` (for `i` from `1` to `n-1`) is `1` if `a[i]` is less than `a[i-1]`, or `i + 1 - inx` where `inx` is determined by `func_1(left, x)` and `last[i-1]`.**
