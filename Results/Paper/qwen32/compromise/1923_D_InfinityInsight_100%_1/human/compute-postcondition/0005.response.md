Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n = len(a)` and `n >= 2`, `left` is a list containing a single element `0`, `last` is a list containing two elements `[-1, i]`, `ans` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times. The current element `a[i]` is not equal to the previous element `a[i - 1]`.**

In simpler terms, the `last` list now contains two elements: `-1` and the current index `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
