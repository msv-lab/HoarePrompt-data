The code snippet appends the sum of the last element of the `left` list and the variable `i` to the `left` list. Therefore, the last element of the `left` list is updated, and the list `left` is extended by one element.

Given that `a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes and must have at least one element, this condition remains unchanged. The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, so its value is assumed to be provided elsewhere in the code.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes and must have at least one element; `left` has an additional element which is the sum of its last element and `i`.**
