The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Since the loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n)`, the next value of `i` should be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is at least 4, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0` and ending with the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times except `ans[2]` which is `3 - inx`, `last` is a list of length `n` where each element after the first is either the index `i` where a change was observed or the last index where a change was observed, `x` is `left[2] - a[2] - 1`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[1]`, `i` is 3**
