### Reasoning:

The given task is to determine the minimum number of seconds required for each slime to be eaten by another slime, provided the eating rules. The program uses two main functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to achieve this.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function performs a binary search to find the position where a given value `x` can be inserted in the list `a` while maintaining sorted order.
   - If `x` is found in the list, it returns the index of `x` plus one.
   - If `x` is not found, it returns the index where `x` can be inserted.
   - If `x` is less than 0, it returns -1.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum number of seconds required for each slime to be eaten.
   - It initializes three lists: `left` for cumulative sums, `last` to track the last index of change in slime sizes, and `ans` to store the results.
   - It calculates cumulative sums for the slime sizes and stores them in `left`.
   - For each slime, if it is smaller than its previous neighbor, it can be eaten in one second.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the position where the current slime could have been eaten using `func_1` and `last`.
   - It updates the result list `ans` accordingly.

3. **Main Program**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of slimes and their sizes.
   - It calls `func_2` for the original list of slime sizes.
   - It calls `func_2` for the reversed list of slime sizes and reverses the result.
   - It combines the results from both directions to get the minimum number of seconds required for each slime to be eaten.
   - It prints the results for each test case.

### Verification:

- The combination of `func_2` being called for both the original and reversed list ensures that the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten is correctly calculated, considering all possible eating scenarios.
- The use of cumulative sums and binary search in `func_1` ensures efficient calculation of the required positions.
- The logic in `func_2` correctly handles the conditions for a slime to be eaten and calculates the minimum time accordingly.

### Conclusion:

Based on the provided reasoning and the verification of the functions and the main program, the given program appears to be correct as it adheres to the problem description and efficiently calculates the required results.

**Correctness: True**
