You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the minimum number of seconds each slime takes to be eaten by another slime, or determine if it is impossible for a slime to be eaten. The rules are:
- A slime can eat its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than the neighbor.
- The process continues until no slime can eat its neighbor.

### Program Explanation
The program is divided into two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

#### Function 1: `func_1(a, x)`
- This function appears to be designed to find the index of the smallest element in the list `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`. If no such element exists, it returns -1.
- It uses `bisect_left` to find the insertion point for `x` in the sorted list `a`. If the element at that position is equal to `x`, it returns the index + 1; otherwise, it returns the insertion point index.

#### Function 2: `func_2(a, n)`
- This function is the main function that calculates the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten.
- It initializes several lists:
  - `left`: cumulative sums of the slime sizes.
  - `last`: keeps track of the last index where a different slime size was encountered.
  - `ans`: the answer list that will store the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten.
- It iterates over the slime sizes and updates the `left` and `last` lists.
- For each slime, it checks if it can be eaten by its left neighbor. If so, it sets the answer to 1.
- If not, it calculates a value `x` and uses `func_1` to find the appropriate index in the `left` list.
- It then updates the answer based on the index found.

### Correctness Evaluation
The program seems to have logical flaws and does not correctly implement the problem's requirements:
1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**: The function `func_1` does not correctly determine the position where a slime can eat another slime based on the problem's rules.
2. **Incorrect Calculation of `x`**: The value `x` calculated as `left[i] - a[i] - 1` does not make sense in the context of the problem.
3. **Incorrect Use of `last` and `left` Lists**: The `last` and `left` lists are not used correctly to determine the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten.
4. **No Consideration of Right Neighbors**: The program only considers the left neighbor, ignoring the possibility of a slime being eaten by its right neighbor.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to properly determine the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten based on the given rules.
