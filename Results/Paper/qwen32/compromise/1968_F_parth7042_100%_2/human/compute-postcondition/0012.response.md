Output State: **`t` is an integer value of `data[0]` and must be at least 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 3; `results` is an empty list; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[0]` contains the value `[0]`.**

In simple terms, the list `mp[0]` now contains the integer `0`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
