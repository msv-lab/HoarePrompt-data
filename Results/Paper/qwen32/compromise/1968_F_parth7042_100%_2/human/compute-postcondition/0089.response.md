Output State: **`t` is an integer value of `data[0]` and must be at least 0, decremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]` and must be at least 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[index])`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is `6 + 2 * n + 1`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[0]` now contains `[0]`; `results` is a list containing the result of each of the `q` queries, either 'YES' or 'NO'.**

In natural language: The value of `pf[i]` has been updated to be the result of `pf[i - 1]` XOR `a[i]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
