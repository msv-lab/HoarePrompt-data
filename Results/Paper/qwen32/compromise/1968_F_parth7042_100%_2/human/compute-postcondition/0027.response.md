The code appends the value of `i` to the list in the `mp` dictionary that corresponds to the key `pf[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3 and `pf[3]` is `int(data[4]) ^ int(data[5])`. Therefore, the list `mp[pf[3]]` will have the value `3` appended to it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value of `data[0]` and must be at least 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `a[0]` is 0, `a[1]` is 0, `a[2]` is `int(data[4])`, `a[3]` is `int(data[5])`, and all other elements are 0; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 6; `results` is an empty list; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[0]` is 0, `pf[1]` is 0, `pf[2]` is `int(data[4])`, `pf[3]` is `int(data[4]) ^ int(data[5])`, and all other elements are 0; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[0]` contains the list `[0, 1]`, `mp[int(data[4])]` contains the list `[2, 2]`, `mp[int(data[4]) ^ int(data[5])]` contains the list `[3]`; `i` is 3**.**
