Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the length of a list `a` of integers, and an integer `q` representing the number of queries. Each integer in the list `a` satisfies the condition `0 <= a_i < 2^30`. For each query, it accepts two integers `l` and `r` such that `1 <= l < r <= n`. The function processes these inputs and returns the result of each query, which is not specified in detail here.**
