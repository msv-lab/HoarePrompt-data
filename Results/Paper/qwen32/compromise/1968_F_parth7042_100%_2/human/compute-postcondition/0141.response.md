The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, none of the variables' values will change due to this statement. The loop will simply proceed to its next iteration without executing any further instructions in the current iteration.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value of `data[0]` decremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]`; `q` is an integer value of `data[index - 3]` and must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and the subsequent `n` elements are the integer values of `data[index - 4]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is `index + 6`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and the subsequent `n` elements are the cumulative XOR of `a[j]` for `j` from 1 to `i`; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list of indices `i` where the cumulative XOR up to `i` is `pf[i]`; `results` is a list containing the result of each of the `q` queries, either 'YES' or 'NO', with the last element now being 'YES'; `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 3]`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is the list of indices `i` where the cumulative XOR up to `i` is `pf[r]`; `v2` is the list of indices `i` where the cumulative XOR up to `i` is `pf[l - 1]` (updated from `mp[pf[l - 1]]`); `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`; `q` is `q - 1`; `it1` is the insertion point of `l` in `v1` found using `bisect_left`.**

In simple terms, none of the variables have changed their values, and the loop will proceed to the next iteration.
