The code snippet `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list stored at the key `pf[i]` in the `mp` dictionary. Given the initial state, `mp[pf[i]]` already contains a list (either `[0]` if `pf[i]` was `0` or an empty list if `pf[i]` was not `0` before this operation), and `i` is appended to this list.

Since `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list`, if `pf[i]` was not already a key in `mp`, it would automatically be created with an empty list as its value before `i` is appended.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value of `data[0]` and must be at least 0, decremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]` and must be at least 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[index])`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is `6 + 2 * n + 1`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[pf[i]]` now contains `[0, i]` if `pf[i]` was `0` before, or `[i]` if `pf[i]` was not `0` before; `results` is a list containing the result of each of the `q` queries, either 'YES' or 'NO'.**

In simpler terms, the list at `mp[pf[i]]` now includes `i` as an additional element. If `pf[i]` was `0` before, the list will be `[0, i]`; otherwise, it will be `[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
