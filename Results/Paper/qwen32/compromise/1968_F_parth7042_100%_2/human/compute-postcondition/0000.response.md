The provided code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings. This list is assigned to the variable `data`. The initial state specifies several variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, `r`) but does not provide their specific values. The code does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, or `r` directly; it only introduces a new variable `data`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30; for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line.**
