The provided code snippet reinitializes the `mp` variable as a `defaultdict` with a default factory of `list`. This means that any new key added to `mp` will have its value initialized as an empty list. All other variables retain their previous values and states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value of `data[0]` and must be at least 0, decremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is `5 + 2 * n + 1`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list`; `results` is a list containing the result of each of the `q` queries, either 'YES' or 'NO'.**
