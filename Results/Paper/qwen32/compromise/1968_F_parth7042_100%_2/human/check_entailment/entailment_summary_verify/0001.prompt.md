You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

import sys
from collections import defaultdict
from bisect import bisect_left

input = sys.stdin.read

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes a list of integers and a series of queries. Each query asks whether there exists a subarray within a specified range that has a bitwise XOR of zero. The function returns 'YES' if such a subarray exists and 'NO' otherwise for each query.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's walk through the reasoning step by step to determine the correctness of the provided Python program.

### Understanding the Problem
The problem requires us to determine if a subarray can be split into two or more parts where the bitwise XOR of the elements in each part is the same. We need to handle multiple test cases and multiple queries for each test case.

### Key Concepts in the Program
1. **Prefix XOR (pf)**: The program computes the prefix XOR for the array. `pf[i]` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to the `i`-th element.
2. **Mapping Prefix XOR Values (mp)**: The program uses a dictionary to map each prefix XOR value to the indices where it occurs.
3. **Query Handling**: For each query `(l, r)`, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` using the prefix XOR values: `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`. If `x == 0`, the subarray can be trivially split into two parts with the same XOR (since the entire subarray has an XOR of 0). Otherwise, the program checks if there exists an index `i` in the subarray where the prefix XOR up to `i` (exclusive) equals `pf[l-1]` and the prefix XOR up to `r` (inclusive) equals `pf[r]`. This would imply that the XOR of the subarray from `l` to `i` is equal to the XOR of the subarray from `i+1` to `r`.

### Detailed Explanation of the Program
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once and processes it in a loop for each test case.
2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: For each element in the array, the program calculates the prefix XOR and stores it in the `pf` array.
3. **Mapping Prefix XOR Values**: The program uses a dictionary `mp` to store the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.
4. **Processing Queries**: For each query `(l, r)`, the program calculates `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`. If `x == 0`, the answer is "YES". Otherwise, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find if there exists an index `i` in the subarray `[l, r]` such that `pf[i] == pf[l-1]` and `pf[r]` is present after `i`. If such an `i` exists, the answer is "YES"; otherwise, it is "NO".

### Correctness Verification
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray can be split into two or more parts with the same XOR value. It efficiently handles the prefix XOR calculation and uses a dictionary and binary search to quickly find the required indices for each query.

### Conclusion
The program is correct as it correctly handles the problem requirements and constraints. It efficiently processes the input and provides the correct output for each query.

Correctness: **True**
