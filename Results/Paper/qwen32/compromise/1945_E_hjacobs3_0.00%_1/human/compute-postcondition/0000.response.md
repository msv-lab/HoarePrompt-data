The code snippet provided only calculates the length of the `array` and assigns it to the variable `n`. No other variables are modified, and no operations are performed that would affect the values of `array` or `find`.

Output State: **array is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to n, and find is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n); n is the length of the array.**
