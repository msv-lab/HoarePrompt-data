t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), and y is 0. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
