In the provided code snippet, the for loop iterates `T` times, where `T` is the number of test cases. The loop head only contains the variable `_` and `T`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we only need to adjust the state of `T`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of integers) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given that the loop will execute `T` times, the only requirement is that `T` must be greater than 0. The provided state already satisfies this condition since `1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4`.

Thus, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5); `y` is 0; The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**
