Postcondition: **`T` is `T-1`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `x` is at least 2, `y` is the third integer from the new input, `list0` is the new sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `num` is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`. If `num` is equal to 1, `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.**
