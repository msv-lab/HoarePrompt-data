### Reasoning:

The given problem requires counting the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks from a set of sticks such that they can form a non-degenerate triangle. For three lengths to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be strictly greater than the length of the third side.

The provided program does not correctly address this requirement. Instead, it focuses on counting combinations of sticks based on the frequency of their lengths, which does not ensure that the triangle inequality holds.

Here are the issues with the program:
1. **Triangle Inequality Violation**: The program does not check the triangle inequality condition (`a + b > c`, `a + c > b`, `b + c > a`) for any combination of three sticks.
2. **Incorrect Approach**: The program counts combinations based on the frequency of stick lengths without considering the actual lengths and their relationships.
3. **Logic Flaw**: The program does not handle the cases where the lengths might be different but still satisfy the triangle inequality.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to:
- Sort the stick lengths.
- Use a three-pointer approach or nested loops to check all combinations of three sticks and verify the triangle inequality for each combination.

### Correctness:
