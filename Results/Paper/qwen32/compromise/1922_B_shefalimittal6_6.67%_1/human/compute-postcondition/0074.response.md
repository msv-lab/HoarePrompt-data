The given code snippet updates the `num_of_lens` dictionary by incrementing the count of the integer `x` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `nums`, and `res`) are not directly affected by this line of code.

Here is the detailed breakdown:
- `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1. If `x` was not already a key in `num_of_lens`, it is added with the value 1. If `x` was already a key, its value is increased by 1.

Since `x` is not specified in the initial state, we will denote it as `x` in the output state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the count of `x` is incremented by 1; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must contain at least one element; `res` is the sum of math.comb(cnt, 3) for all cnt ≥ 3 and math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum for all cnt ≥ 2, where total_sum is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals cnt.**
