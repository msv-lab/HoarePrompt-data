Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 3)`; `cnt` is an integer with a value of at least 3.**

In simple terms, the value of `res` has been updated to the result of the combination formula `math.comb(cnt, 3)`, where `cnt` is an integer with a value of at least 3. All other variables retain their initial values.
