Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum + math.comb(cnt, 3)`. If `cnt` is 2, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. Otherwise, `res` remains 0. `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals `cnt`.**

However, there seems to be a small discrepancy in the if part description where `res` is defined as `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum + math.comb(cnt, 3)`. Given that `math.comb(cnt, 3)` is added twice, it should likely be `res` is `2 * math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. Assuming this correction, the postcondition should be:
