Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers with at least one integer; The current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. Otherwise, `res` remains 0; `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals `cnt`.**

In natural language: The value of `total_sum` has been calculated as the sum of all values in the dictionary `num_of_lens` except for the value that is equal to `cnt`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
