The only object in the loop head is the variable `x` which is assigned from the list `nums`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `nums`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` needs to be incremented by 1 so that `x` can take the next value from `nums`.

Given that `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 2\), after the current iteration, `t` should be incremented by 1. The variable `x` should then be set to `nums[t + 1]`.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted:
- `t` should be incremented by 1.
- `x` should be set to `nums[t + 1]`.

The other variables (`n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, `res`) do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `n` is the input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the count of `x` is incremented by 1, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must contain at least one element, `res` is the sum of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for all `cnt` ≥ 3 and `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for all `cnt` ≥ 2, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals `cnt`, `x` is `nums[t + 1]`**
