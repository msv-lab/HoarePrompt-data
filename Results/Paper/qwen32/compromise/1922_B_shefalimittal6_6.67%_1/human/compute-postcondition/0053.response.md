Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers with at least one integer; The current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. Otherwise, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`; `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals `cnt`.**

In natural language: The value of `res` is updated by adding the product of `math.comb(cnt, 2)` and `total_sum` to its previous value. All other variables retain their initial values.
