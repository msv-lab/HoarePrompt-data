The code snippet provided updates the value of `res` by adding `math.comb(cnt, 3)` to it. This means we need to adjust the value of `res` based on the current value of `cnt`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the input integer
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair
- `nums` is a list of integers with at least one integer
- `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` to be processed
- `res` is initially calculated based on the value of `cnt` and `total_sum`
- `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals `cnt`

The code modifies `res` as follows:
- `res += math.comb(cnt, 3)`

The value of `res` after this operation will be the original value of `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` to be processed; `res` is the original `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)`; `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals `cnt`.**
