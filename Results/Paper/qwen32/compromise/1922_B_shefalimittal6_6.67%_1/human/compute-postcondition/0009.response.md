The only object in the loop head is the variable `x`, which is the iteration variable for the list `nums`. According to the loop, `x` takes on the value of each element in the list `nums` one at a time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is the current element being processed, and `num_of_lens[x]` has been incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in the list `nums` following `x`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `x` takes on the next value in `nums`. Since we do not have information about the specific values in `nums`, we can only describe the state in terms of the next element in the list.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value incremented by 1, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least two elements, `x` is the next element in `nums`. The value of `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1.** 

However, to be more precise about the state, we should indicate that `x` is now the next element in `nums` after the previously processed element. Since we don't have the exact values, we can denote the next element as `nums[index + 1]` where `index` is the position of the previously processed `x` in `nums`. But since we are only allowed to adjust the objects in the loop head, we just denote `x` as the next element.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value incremented by 1, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least two elements, `x` is the next element in `nums`.**
