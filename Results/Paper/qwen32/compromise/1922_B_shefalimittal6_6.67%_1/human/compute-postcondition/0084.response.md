The code snippet `res += math.comb(cnt, 3)` calculates the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 3 at a time and adds this value to `res`. The value of `res` is updated accordingly, while other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `res` is initially 0. After executing the code, `res` will be equal to `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.

Output State: **`t` is `n - 1`, `n` is the input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least one unique element, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 3)`, and `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.**
