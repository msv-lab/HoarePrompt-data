The code snippet updates the dictionary `num_of_lens` by incrementing the count of the key `x` by 1. If `x` does not exist in the dictionary, it initializes the count to 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `nums`, and `res` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the count of `x` is incremented by 1; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element; `res` is the accumulated sum of combinations based on the counts in `num_of_lens`.**
