The code provided reads an integer `t` from the input. This integer `t` represents the number of test cases. The values of `n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` for each test case are not yet read or processed by the given code snippet. Therefore, the only change is that `t` is now assigned the value read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. `t` is assigned the value read from the input.**
