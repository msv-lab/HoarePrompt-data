Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `nums` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `nums`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
    if cnt >= 2:
        total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
        res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cnt` is an integer. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`; if `cnt` is 2, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`; otherwise, `res` remains 0. `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is `2 * math.comb(cnt, 3) + 2 * math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. If `cnt` is 2, `res` is `2 * math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains 0. `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals `cnt`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is incremented by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
