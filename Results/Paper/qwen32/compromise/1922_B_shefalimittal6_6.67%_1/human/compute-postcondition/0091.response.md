Output State: **`t` is `n - 1`, `n` is the input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one unique element, `cnt` is `next_cnt`, `res` is calculated based on the value of `next_cnt` and `total_sum` plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the value equal to `next_cnt`**

Natural language: The value of `res` has been updated by adding the result of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` to its previous value. All other variables retain their initial values.
