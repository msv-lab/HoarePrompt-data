### Reasoning:

The original assessment is **incorrect** in its conclusion that the provided program is incorrect. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - To maximize this beauty, the array should be rearranged such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The provided program calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array for each test case.
   - For a sorted array in ascending order, the beauty is maximized because the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

3. **Mathematical Insight**:
   - If the array is sorted in ascending order, the beauty is the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - The sum of these differences is equivalent to the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array.
   - For example, in the array \([43, 54, 80, 90, 100]\), the beauty is \((54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57\).
   - This sum can also be calculated as \(100 - 43 = 57\), which is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements.

4. **Verification with Test Cases**:
   - **Test Case 1**:
     - Input: `3 2 1 3`
     - Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]`
     - Beauty: \((2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2\)
     - Max - Min: \(3 - 1 = 2\)
   - **Test Case 2**:
     - Input: `3 69 69 69`
     - Sorted: `[69, 69, 69]`
     - Beauty: \((69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0 + 0 = 0\)
     - Max - Min: \(69 - 69 = 0\)
   - **Test Case 3**:
     - Input: `5 100 54 80 43 90`
     - Sorted: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
     - Beauty: \((54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57\)
     - Max - Min: \(100 - 43 = 57\)
   - **Test Case 4**:
     - Input: `4 3 4 3 3`
     - Sorted: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
     - Beauty: \((3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1\)
     - Max - Min: \(4 - 3 = 1\)
   - **Test Case 5**:
     - Input: `2 2 1`
     - Sorted: `[1, 2]`
     - Beauty: \((2 - 1) = 1\)
     - Max - Min: \(2 - 1 = 1\)

In all test cases, the program correctly computes the maximum beauty of the array by calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum elements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
