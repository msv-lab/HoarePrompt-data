Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, one should arrange the array in a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This can be achieved by sorting the array and then summing up the differences between consecutive elements. However, the given program only finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints their difference, which is not equivalent to the maximum beauty of the array as defined in the problem statement.

The correct approach would be to sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the sum of differences between consecutive elements. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        nums.sort()
        beauty = sum(nums[i] - nums[i-1] for i in range(1, l))
        print(beauty)
```

This program sorts the array and then calculates the beauty by summing up the differences between consecutive elements, which is the correct approach to solve the problem.
