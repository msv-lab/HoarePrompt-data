Let's break down the initial state and the given code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
- `l` is an integer value obtained from the input.
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the new input.
- `x` is the maximum value in the first `l` elements of `nums`.
- `y` is the minimum value in the first `l` elements of `nums`.
- `e` is incremented by `l`.
- `i` is set to `l`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(x - y)
```

### Analysis:
- `x` is the maximum value in the first `l` elements of `nums`.
- `y` is the minimum value in the first `l` elements of `nums`.
- The `print(x - y)` statement will output the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the first `l` elements of `nums`.

### Output:
The output will be the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the first `l` elements of the `nums` list. Since the exact values of `nums` and `l` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `x - y`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output this difference.

Output: **x - y (where x is the maximum value in the first l elements of nums, and y is the minimum value in the first l elements of nums)**
