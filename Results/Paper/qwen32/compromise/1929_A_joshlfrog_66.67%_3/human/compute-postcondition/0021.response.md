The code snippet `y = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `y`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `y` is updated to the value of `nums[2]`. The value of `x` remains unchanged based on the provided conditions, and `y` is updated to the value of `nums[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 2, `x` is unchanged, `y` is `nums[2]`.**
