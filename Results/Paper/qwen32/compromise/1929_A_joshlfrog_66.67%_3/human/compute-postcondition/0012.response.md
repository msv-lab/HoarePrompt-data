Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 0, `x` is either 0 or `nums[0]` (depending on whether `nums[0]` was greater than the initial value of `x`), and `y` is `nums[0]` if `nums[i]` is less than `y`; otherwise, `y` remains 100000000.**
