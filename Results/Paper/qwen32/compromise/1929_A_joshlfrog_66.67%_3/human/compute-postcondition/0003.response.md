The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `nums`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `l`. The new variable `nums` is introduced and populated with the input values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
