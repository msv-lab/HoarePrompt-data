To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(n + 1):`, which means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `n`.

Let's analyze the requirements for the loop to execute:

1. **`n`**: This is an input integer. For the loop to execute, `n` must be such that `n + 1` is greater than 0, because `range(n + 1)` will generate numbers from 0 up to `n` inclusive. Therefore, `n` must be at least -1 to ensure that the loop runs at least once (since `range(0)` is an empty range, and `range(1)` will include 0).

2. **`i`**: The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts. The loop will initialize `i` to 0 at the start of the first iteration.

Given these requirements, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `n` is at least -1. The other variables (`arr`, `mpp`, `first`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` must be at least -1, `i` is 0 (automatically set at the start of the loop)**

However, since `i` is automatically set at the start of the loop, we do not need to explicitly state it in the final adjusted state. Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`n` must be at least -1**
