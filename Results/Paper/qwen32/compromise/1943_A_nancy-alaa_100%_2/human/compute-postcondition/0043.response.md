Given the initial state:

- `n` must be at least -1.
- `i` is not a key in the dictionary `mpp`.

The task is to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(i)`.

Since there is no information provided about the specific value of `i` other than it not being a key in the dictionary `mpp`, we can only describe the output in terms of `i`.

The code simply prints the variable `i` as it is. There is no computation or transformation applied to `i` before printing.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `i`.

Output: **i (where i is the value of the variable i)**
