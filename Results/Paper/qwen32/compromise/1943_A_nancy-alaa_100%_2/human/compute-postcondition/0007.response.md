Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4.
   - This variable `t` is mentioned but not used in the provided print statement.
   
2. **`n`**: An input integer that must be at least 0.
   - This variable `n` is mentioned but not used in the provided print statement.

3. **`arr`**: A list of integers obtained by splitting the input line and converting each split component to an integer.
   - This list `arr` is mentioned but not used in the provided print statement.

4. **`mpp`**: A Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
   - This Counter object `mpp` is mentioned but not used in the provided print statement.

5. **`first`**: A boolean variable set to False.
   - This variable `first` is mentioned but not used in the provided print statement.

6. **`i`**: Not a key in `mpp`.
   - This variable `i` is mentioned and is not a key in the `mpp` Counter object. It is not defined with any specific value other than the fact that it is not a key in `mpp`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(i)
```
- The variable `i` is not defined with a specific value in the initial state, except for the fact that it is not a key in `mpp`. Since `i` is not a key in `mpp`, it could be any value that is not present in `arr`.

### Output Determination:
Since `i` is not defined with a specific value and the only information we have is that it is not a key in `mpp`, the exact value of `i` cannot be determined from the given information. However, we can describe the output in terms of the given constraints.

### Final Output:
The variable `i` is not defined with a specific value in the initial state, except that it is not a key in the `mpp` Counter object. Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `i`, which is not a key in `mpp`.

Output: **i (where i is not a key in mpp)**
