The given code snippet changes the value of the variable `first` from `False` to `True`. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` must be at least 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split by spaces, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is True, and `i` is a key in `mpp` with a frequency of 1.**
