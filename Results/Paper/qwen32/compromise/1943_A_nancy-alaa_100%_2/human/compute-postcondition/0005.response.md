To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

The `for` loop statement is:
```
for i in range(n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Here, `i` is the loop variable, and `n` is the upper limit of the range (exclusive), which means the loop will execute `n + 1` times, starting from `i = 0` up to `i = n`.

### Analysis:

1. **Variable `i`:**
   - Before the loop starts, `i` is not explicitly defined in the given state. However, the loop initializes `i` to `0` during the first iteration, so no adjustment is needed for `i` before the loop starts.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - The loop will execute `n + 1` times. For the loop to execute at least once, `n + 1` must be greater than `0`, which means `n` must be at least `0`. Given that `n` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `n` is `0` or greater.

### Adjustments:

- **`n` must be at least `0`:** To ensure the loop executes, `n` should be `0` or greater. The provided state does not specify any constraints on `n` other than it being an integer, so we need to add this constraint.

### Final State:

The state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least `0`. The other variables (`t`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input line and converting each split component to an integer; `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`; `first` is False**
