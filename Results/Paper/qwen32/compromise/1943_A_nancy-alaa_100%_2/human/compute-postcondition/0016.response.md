Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input line and converting each split component to an integer; `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`; `first` is a boolean. If `first` is True and `i` is a key in `mpp` with `mpp[i]` equal to 1, then `first` remains True. Otherwise, `first` remains True and the condition inside the if statement is not satisfied.**
