Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob, nor does it compute the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends. The program directly tries to find the MEX of the array `a` without considering the optimal moves made by Alice and Bob.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Optimal Play Simulation**: The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. Alice is supposed to maximize the MEX, and Bob is supposed to minimize it. The program does not account for this strategic play.

2. **MEX Calculation**: The program attempts to find the MEX of the array `a` by checking for the smallest non-negative integer not present in `a`. However, this is not the correct approach because the array `c` (which is built during the game) should be used to determine the MEX, not the original array `a`.

3. **Logic Flaws**: The logic in the program to determine the MEX is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that if a number appears only once and after another number has appeared only once, it should be printed. This logic does not align with the problem's requirements.

To illustrate the incorrectness, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
4
0 0 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of the Correct Output:**
- Alice and Bob play optimally.
- One possible sequence of moves could be:
  1. Alice picks `0`, `a = [0, 1, 1]`, `c = [0]`
  2. Bob picks `0`, `a = [1, 1]`, `c = [0]`
  3. Alice picks `1`, `a = [1]`, `c = [0, 1]`
  4. Bob picks `1`, `a = []`, `c = [0, 1]`
- The MEX of `c = [0, 1]` is `2`.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
The program will output `2` for this case, but the logic used is not robust and does not generalize to all cases. For example, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
3
0 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation of the Correct Output:**
- Alice and Bob play optimally.
- One possible sequence of moves could be:
  1. Alice picks `0`, `a = [1, 2]`, `c = [0]`
  2. Bob picks `1`, `a = [2]`, `c = [0]`
  3. Alice picks `2`, `a = []`, `c = [0, 2]`
- The MEX of `c = [0, 2]` is `1`.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
The program will output `1` for this case, but the logic is still flawed and does not account for the optimal play by Alice and Bob.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly simulate the game and does not compute the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.
