To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the strategy to find a pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized, using at most \(3n\) queries.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Finding the Maximum Element:**
   - The program starts by finding the index of the maximum element in the permutation using \(n-1\) queries.
   - It initializes `max_item_idx` to 0 and iterates over the range from 1 to \(n-1\).
   - For each index \(i\), it queries the OR result between `max_item_idx` and \(i\) with itself, i.e., `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `max_item_idx` to \(i\).
   - This approach correctly identifies the index of the maximum element in the permutation.

2. **Finding the Pair with Maximum XOR:**
   - The program then tries to find the pair \((i, j)\) that maximizes the XOR value.
   - It initializes `pair_idx` to `max_item_idx` and iterates over all indices \(i\).
   - For each index \(i\), it queries the OR result between `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` with `max_item_idx` and \(i\), i.e., `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `pair_idx` to \(i\).
   - If the result is `=`, it performs an additional query to determine if \(i\) should be the new `pair_idx` by comparing the OR result between `pair_idx` and \(i\) with itself, i.e., `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)`.
     - If the result is `>`, it updates `pair_idx` to \(i\).
   - This approach aims to find the pair that maximizes the XOR value, but it may not be optimal or correct in all cases.

### Potential Issues:
- The strategy for finding the pair with the maximum XOR value is not optimal and may not work correctly in all scenarios.
- The additional query when the result is `=` is not guaranteed to find the pair with the maximum XOR value.
- The program does not consider all possible pairs and may miss the optimal pair.

### Conclusion:
Given the potential issues with the strategy for finding the pair with the maximum XOR value, the program may not always produce the correct result. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
