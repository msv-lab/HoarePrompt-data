You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding:
The problem requires us to determine how many natural numbers \( k \) fit the given constraints:
- \( k \) is the number of positions in the first segment of the sequence.
- The sequence repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
- Vasya's position in the line is \( n \).
- Vasya's number in the sequence is \( x \).

### Analysis of the Program:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case:
1. It reads \( n \) and \( x \).
2. It initializes an empty list `output` to store valid \( k \) values.
3. It checks two conditions:
   - If \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \):
     - It calls `func_1(n + x - 2)` to get divisors of \( n + x - 2 \).
     - For each divisor \( s \), if \( (s + 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (s + 2) / 2 \ge x \), it adds \( (s + 2) / 2 \) to `output`.
   - If \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \):
     - It calls `func_1(n - x)` to get divisors of \( n - x \).
     - For each divisor \( s \), if \( (s + 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (s + 2) / 2 \ge x \), it adds \( (s + 2) / 2 \) to `output`.
4. It removes duplicates from `output` and prints the length of `output`.

### Function `func_1`:
- This function calculates all divisors of a given number \( x \).
- It returns a list of divisors sorted in descending order.

### Correctness Check:
Let's check if the logic correctly identifies valid \( k \) values:
- The logic considers two cases based on the parity of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).
- For each case, it finds divisors of the respective number and checks if they can form valid \( k \) values.
- The condition \( (s + 2) \% 2 == 0 \) ensures that \( (s + 2) / 2 \) is an integer.
- The condition \( (s + 2) / 2 \ge x \) ensures that the calculated \( k \) is large enough to accommodate Vasya's number \( x \).

However, there are a few issues with the provided program:
- The function `func_1` is called before it is defined in the code, which will result in a `NameError`.
- The function `func_1` should return a list of unique divisors, but the current implementation returns each divisor twice (once in `output1` and once in `output2`), which can lead to incorrect results.
- The logic to determine valid \( k \) might not be fully correct. The conditions \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \) do not directly relate to the problem's requirements. The correct approach should involve checking the position \( n \) within the repeating sequence of length \( 2k - 2 \).

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the function definition and the logic to determine valid \( k \), the program is not correct as it stands.
