The function `sep_num(x)` is incorrectly defined based on the problem description. The correct function should take two parameters, `n` and `x`, where `n` is Vasya's position in the line and `x` is the number Vasya received during the settling. Therefore, the correct function definition should be `def sep_num(n, x):`. Additionally, `n` and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9.
