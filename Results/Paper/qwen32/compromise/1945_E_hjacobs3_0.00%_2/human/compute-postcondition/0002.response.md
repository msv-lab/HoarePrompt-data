In the given task, the `while` loop condition is `l <= r`. This means that for the loop to execute at least once, the condition `l <= r` must be true before the loop starts.

Let's analyze the variables involved in the loop condition:
- `l` (left) is initialized to 0.
- `r` (right) is initialized to `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the `array`.

For the loop to execute the first time, `l` (which is 0) must be less than or equal to `r` (which is `n - 1`). Since `n` is the length of the `array` and `1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5`, `n - 1` will always be greater than or equal to 0 for valid values of `n`. Therefore, the condition `l <= r` will always be true if `n` is at least 1.

Given that the initial values of `l` and `r` already satisfy the condition `l <= r` for valid `n`, no modification is needed to the state to ensure that the loop executes at least once.

Therefore, the state remains the same:

State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), `find` is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n) that needs to be found in the permutation, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`**
