The code snippet provided only reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The variables `a`, `b`, and `m` are mentioned in the initial state but are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of the integer value read from the input to `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, `a`, `b`, and `m` are unchanged where 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18, and there are t test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**
