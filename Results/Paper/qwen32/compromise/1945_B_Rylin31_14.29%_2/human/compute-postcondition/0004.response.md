Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. For each test case, it computes and prints a result based on these integers. The result is the sum of the integer divisions of `mn` (which is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`) by `a` and `b`, with an additional `1` added to the result if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is `1`. The function outputs `t` lines, each corresponding to the result of one test case.**
