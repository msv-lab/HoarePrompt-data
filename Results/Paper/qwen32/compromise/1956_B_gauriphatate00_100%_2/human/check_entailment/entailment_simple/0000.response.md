### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to calculate the maximum number of points the player (you) can get by playing optimally. However, the logic in the function `func_1` does not accurately reflect the optimal strategy for the game as described in the problem statement.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Objective of the Game**: The goal is to maximize your score by selecting cards optimally, given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.
2. **Current Logic**: The current implementation simply counts how many numbers appear exactly twice in your hand and returns that count. This does not take into account the strategic placement of cards and the interaction between your moves and Nene's optimal responses.
3. **Optimal Strategy**: The optimal strategy involves making moves that maximize your points while also considering Nene's optimal responses. This requires a more complex approach, such as using a greedy algorithm or dynamic programming to simulate the game and account for both players' moves.

### Conclusion:

The current implementation does not correctly simulate the game and does not account for the strategic interactions between the players. Therefore, the program is not correct based on the problem description.

### Correctness: **False**
