Reasoning: The program provided does not correctly solve the problem described. The function `func_1` simply counts the number of integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly twice in the list `a`. However, the problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally, considering that Nene always plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

The current implementation does not take into account the game dynamics, the turns, or the strategy that both players use. It merely counts pairs in your hand, which is not sufficient to determine your maximum score given Nene's optimal play.

Correctness: **False**
