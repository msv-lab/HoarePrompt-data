Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `path`, a string representing a sequence of space-separated integers, and `n`, an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100. The integers in `path` represent the periodicities of the signs, each being between 1 and 10^6 inclusive. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information.**
