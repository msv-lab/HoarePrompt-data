The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from standard input, splits it by spaces, and assigns the resulting list of strings to the variable `data`. The initial state of `path` and `n` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`path` is a string representing a sequence of space-separated integers, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from `path`.**
