You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: path is a list of characters, where each character can be either '@' or '*'.
def func_1(path):
    n = len(path)
    if (n == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: `path` is a list of characters, where each character can be either '@' or '*'; `n` is the length of `path` and `n` is greater than 0
    dp = [0] * n
    if (path[0] == '@') :
        dp[0] = 1
    else :
        if (path[0] == '*') :
            dp[0] = -float('inf')
        #State: `path` is a list of characters, where each character can be either '@' or '*'; `n` is the length of `path` and `n` is greater than 0. If the first element of `path` is '*', then the first element of `dp` is set to `-float('inf')`. Otherwise, `dp` remains a list of `n` zeros. The first element of `path` is '*'.
    #State: `path` is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*', `n` is the length of `path` and `n` is greater than 0. If the first element of `path` is '@', then the first element of `dp` is `1`. Otherwise, the first element of `dp` is `-float('inf')`. The rest of `dp` remains a list of zeros.
    if (n > 1) :
        if (path[1] == '*') :
            dp[1] = -float('inf')
        else :
            dp[1] = dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)
        #State: `path` is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*', and `n` is the length of `path` with `n` greater than 1. If the first element of `path` is '@', then the first element of `dp` is `1`; otherwise, the first element of `dp` is `-float('inf')`. The second element of `dp` is `-float('inf')` if the second element of `path` is '*', otherwise it is `dp[0] + 1` if the second element of `path` is '@', or `dp[0]` if the second element of `path` is not '@'. The rest of `dp` remains a list of zeros.
    #State: `path` is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*', and `n` is the length of `path` with `n` greater than 0. If `n` is 1, `dp` remains a list where the first element is `1` if the first element of `path` is '@', otherwise it is `-float('inf')`, and the rest of `dp` is zeros. If `n` is greater than 1, the first element of `dp` is `1` if the first element of `path` is '@', otherwise it is `-float('inf')`. The second element of `dp` is `-float('inf')` if the second element of `path` is '*', otherwise it is `dp[0] + 1` if the second element of `path` is '@', or `dp[0]` if the second element of `path` is not '@'. The rest of `dp` remains zeros.
    for i in range(2, n):
        if path[i] == '*':
            dp[i] = -float('inf')
        else:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)
        
    #State: dp = [1, -float('inf'), 2, 3]
    return max(x for x in dp if x > -float('inf'))
    #The program returns 3.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `path`, which is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*'. The function returns 0 in Case_1 and 3 in Case_2.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns 3.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
