Output State: **`path` is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*', `n` is the length of `path` and `n` is greater than 1. If the first element of `path` is '@', then the first element of `dp` is `1`. Otherwise, the first element of `dp` is `-float('inf')`. The second element of `dp` is `dp[0] + 1` if the second element of `path` is '@', otherwise it is `dp[0]`. The rest of `dp` remains a list of zeros. The second element of `path` is not '*'**.

In simpler terms: The first element of `dp` remains the same based on the initial condition of `path`. The second element of `dp` is updated to be the first element of `dp` plus 1 if the second element of `path` is '@', otherwise it remains the same as the first element of `dp`. The rest of `dp` and `path` are unchanged.
