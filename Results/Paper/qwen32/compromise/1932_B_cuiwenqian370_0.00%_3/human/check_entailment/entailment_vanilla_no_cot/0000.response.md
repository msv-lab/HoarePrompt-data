Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not solve the problem described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not relevant to the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen based on the given periodicities.

The program seems to be designed for a different problem, possibly related to counting certain symbols in a string, rather than calculating the year of the apocalypse based on the periodicity of signs. The correct approach would involve iterating through each sign's periodicity and calculating the year in which each subsequent sign occurs, starting from the year after the previous sign occurred.
