t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; the first and second lines of each test case are strings of length n consisting of the characters '<' and '>', representing the directions of the arrows in the first and second row of the grid, respectively; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
