In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the variable `_` and the range function, which takes an integer input from the user. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The other variables (`n`, the strings of arrows) are defined inside the loop body and do not affect the loop's execution directly.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `_` and the integer value obtained from `int(input())`. The variable `_` is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use. The loop will execute based on the integer value provided by the user input, which is the number of test cases `t`.

2. **Conditions for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, the integer value from `int(input())` must be at least 1. This is because if `t` is 0 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

3. **State Adjustment**: The state before the loop starts should ensure that the input value `t` is at least 1 to allow the loop to execute. The values of `n` and the strings of arrows are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

Given this understanding, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

**State:** **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
