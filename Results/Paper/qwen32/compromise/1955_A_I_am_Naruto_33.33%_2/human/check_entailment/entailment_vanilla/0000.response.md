Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective**: Determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts, given the individual price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts.
- **Logic**:
  - If `n` is 1, the cost is simply `a`.
  - If `n` is greater than 1, we need to consider two scenarios:
    1. **Scenario 1 (Regular Purchase)**: Buying each yogurt at the regular price `a`, resulting in a total cost of `a * n`.
    2. **Scenario 2 (Promotion Purchase)**: Buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price `b`, and then buying any remaining yogurt at the regular price `a`. The total cost in this scenario is `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.
  - The minimum cost is the smaller value between `ans1` (regular purchase) and `ans2` (promotion purchase).

### Program Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterating over each test case.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- If `n` is greater than 1, it calculates:
  - `ans1` as `a * n` (total cost if buying all yogurts at regular price).
  - `ans2` as `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)` (total cost if buying pairs of yogurts at promotional price and any remaining yogurt at regular price).
- It then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
- If `n` is 1, it directly prints `a` as the cost.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described above and handles all edge cases (e.g., when `n` is 1 or when `n` is even or odd).

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
