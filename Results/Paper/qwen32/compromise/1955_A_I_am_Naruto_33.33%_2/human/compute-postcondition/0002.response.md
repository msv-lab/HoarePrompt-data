The function `func` accepts an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, the function accepts three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`. The constraints for these integers are 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30. After processing each test case, the function returns a value based on the given inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. The function then returns a value based on these inputs for each test case.**
