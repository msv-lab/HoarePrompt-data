To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop based on the given input conditions and the logic within the loop.

The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the program reads three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`. Depending on the value of `n`, it calculates either `a * n` or a combination of `b * n // 2` and `a * n % 2`, and prints the minimum of these values. If `n` is 1, it directly prints `a`.

Since the loop processes each test case independently and outputs a result for each, the state of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` will change with each iteration, but the overall output state will be a series of printed results, one for each test case.

The output state is thus a series of printed values corresponding to the results of each test case. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` from the initial state will not be preserved in the output state as they are input variables and are not retained or modified outside the loop.

Output State: **A series of printed results, each corresponding to the minimum cost calculated for each test case.**
