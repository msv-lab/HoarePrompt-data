The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we need to adjust only this variable for the next iteration of the loop. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was used to index into the lists `a` and `b`. Since the loop increments `j` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1.

Given that `j` was used to index up to `n-1` in the previous iterations, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be `j + 1` and must be less than `n`.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a new integer input by the user (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a new list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9). If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 1 and `i` remains 0. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `i` is 1, `j` is `j + 1`**
