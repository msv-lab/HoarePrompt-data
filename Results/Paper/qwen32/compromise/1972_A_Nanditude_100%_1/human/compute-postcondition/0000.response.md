The code snippet provided reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. This input does not affect the lists `a` and `b` or the integer `n` directly. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain as they were in the initial state. The variable `t` is newly introduced and holds the number of test cases.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of length `n` (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9), `b` is a list of length `n` (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9)**.
