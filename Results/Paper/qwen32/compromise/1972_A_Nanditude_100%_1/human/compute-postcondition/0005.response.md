The code snippet provided initializes a variable `cnt` to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this code snippet.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the integer input by the user (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a new list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9), `cnt` is 0.**
