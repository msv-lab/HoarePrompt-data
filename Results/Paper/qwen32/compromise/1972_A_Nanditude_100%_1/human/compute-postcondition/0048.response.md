The code snippet provided is:
```python
b = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

This line of code will take a new list of integers as input from the user, split it by spaces, convert each element to an integer, and assign this list to the variable `b`. This means the previous value of `b` (which was a list of length `n` consisting of integers) will be replaced by this new list.

The other variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `cnt`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is `t`, `n` is the same integer input by the user, `a` is the new list of integers input by the user, `b` is the new list of integers input by the user, `cnt` is the count of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a`, `i` is the count of elements in `a` that have been compared and found to be less than or equal to elements in `b` (or `n` if all elements in `a` have been compared), `j` is `n`**.
