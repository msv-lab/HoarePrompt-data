To determine what will be printed by the `print(cnt)` statement, let's break down the problem based on the given initial state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, it's part of the initial state).
- `n` is an integer input by the user, with the constraint \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `a` is a list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user.
- `b` is a list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user, with the constraint \(1 \leq b_1 \leq b_2 \leq ... \leq b_n \leq 10^9\).
- `cnt` is the count of elements in `b` that are less than elements in `a` until `a[i]` is no longer exceeded by `b[j]`.
- `i` is the count of elements in `a` that have been matched or exceeded by elements in `b`.

### Calculation of `cnt`:
The variable `cnt` is calculated by comparing elements of the two lists `a` and `b`. Here's the step-by-step process:
1. Initialize `cnt` to 0.
2. Iterate through each element `a[i]` in the list `a`.
3. For each `a[i]`, iterate through the elements in `b` until you find an element `b[j]` that is greater than or equal to `a[i]`.
4. Count the number of elements in `b` that are less than `a[i]` before finding such a `b[j]`.
5. Update `cnt` with the count of these elements.

### Explanation:
- Since `b` is sorted in non-decreasing order, for each `a[i]`, you can efficiently count how many elements in `b` are less than `a[i]` by iterating through `b` until you find the first element that is not less than `a[i]`.
- The variable `cnt` will hold the total count of such elements for all `a[i]`.

### Output:
The `print(cnt)` statement will output the value of `cnt` which is the total count of elements in `b` that are less than elements in `a` until `a[i]` is no longer exceeded by `b[j]`.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the total count of elements in `b` that are less than elements in `a` until `a[i]` is no longer exceeded by `b[j]`)**
