The only variable in the loop head is `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` should be 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is `t`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are lists of integers input by the user, `j` is 1, and `cnt` is either 0, 1, or 2. If `b[j] < a[i]`, then `cnt` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `i` is either 1 or 2 and `cnt` is either 0 or 1.**
