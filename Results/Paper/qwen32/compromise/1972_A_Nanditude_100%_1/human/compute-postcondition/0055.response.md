Output State: **`t` is `t`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the new list of integers input by the user, `b` is the new list of integers input by the user, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is `n`, and `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`.**

Natural language: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
