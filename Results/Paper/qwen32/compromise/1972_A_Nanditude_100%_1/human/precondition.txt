t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: n (a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100), a (a list of integers of length n such that 1 <= a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n <= 10^9), and b (a list of integers of length n such that 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9).
