**Reasoning:**

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by constructing the lexicographically smallest three-letter word based on the encoded integer value `n`. Let's break down the logic and verify its correctness:

1. **For `n <= 26`:** 
    - The smallest possible word should be formed with the smallest possible letters. The only way to make a sum of `n` with three letters where `n` is at most 26 is to have the first two letters as 'a' and the third letter as the one corresponding to the value `n - 1` (since 'a' corresponds to 1).
    - The program correctly handles this case with the line `word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.

2. **For `27 <= n <= 52`:**
    - Here, we need to form a sum that is more than 26 but not more than 52. The smallest possible word would start with 'a', and the second letter would be chosen such that the sum of the positions of the first two letters is as close to `n` as possible without exceeding it. The third letter would be 'z' (position 26).
    - The program correctly handles this case with the line `word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.

3. **For `n > 52`:**
    - In this case, the sum is large enough that we can have letters other than 'a' in the first two positions. The goal is to minimize the word lexicographically, so we should choose the smallest possible letters for the first two positions and the third letter as 'z'.
    - The program correctly handles this case with the line `word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.

However, there is a mistake in the handling of the `n > 52` case. The correct formula should be `word += alphabet[n - 52 - 1] + 'zz'` because `n - 52` gives the position of the first letter in the alphabet, and we need to subtract 1 to get the correct index in the `alphabet` string (which is 0-based).

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect due to the off-by-one error in the `n > 52` case.

**Correctness: False**
