Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for all possible values of `n` within the given range (3 ≤ n ≤ 78). Let's analyze the logic in the program and see where it might go wrong:

1. The program first checks if `n > 52`. If true, it constructs the word by taking the letter corresponding to `n - 53` and appending 'zz'. This part of the logic seems correct for `n` values greater than 52, as it ensures the sum of the positions is `n` and the word is lexicographically smallest by using 'zz' as the last two letters.

2. If `n` is between 27 and 52, the program constructs the word by appending 'a', the letter corresponding to `n - 28`, and 'z'. This logic is not correct because it does not guarantee the smallest possible word. For example, if `n = 27`, the program would output 'acz', but the lexicographically smallest word that sums to 27 is 'aba'.

3. If `n` is between 3 and 26, the program constructs the word by appending 'aa' and the letter corresponding to `n - 3`. This logic is also incorrect because it does not guarantee the smallest possible word. For example, if `n = 3`, the program would output 'aaa', which is correct, but for `n = 4`, it would output 'aab', whereas the correct output should be 'aaa'.

To fix the program, a more systematic approach should be used to find the lexicographically smallest word by iterating through possible combinations of three letters and checking their sums. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        for a in range(26):
            for b in range(26):
                for c in range(26):
                    if a + b + c + 3 == n:
                        print(alphabet[a] + alphabet[b] + alphabet[c])
                        break
                else:
                    continue
                break
            else:
                continue
            break

func()
```

However, this brute-force approach is inefficient. A more optimized approach would be to use a greedy algorithm to construct the word from the smallest letters possible. Here's an optimized version:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        # Start with the smallest possible letters
        a = b = c = 0
        # Try to maximize the last letter (c) while keeping the sum <= n
        while a + b + c + 3 < n:
            c += 1
        # Try to maximize the middle letter (b) while keeping the sum <= n
        while a + b + c + 3 < n:
            b += 1
            c = 0
            while a + b + c + 3 < n:
                c += 1
        # Adjust the first letter (a) if necessary
        a += n - (a + b + c + 3)
        print(chr(a + 97) + chr(b + 97) + chr(c + 97))

func()
```

This optimized version ensures that the word is constructed in a lexicographically smallest manner.
