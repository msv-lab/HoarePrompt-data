To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the problem and the program step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` and appending them to an array `c` (Alice's turn) or just removing them from `a` (Bob's turn). The goal is to determine the final MEX of `c` when both players play optimally.

### Optimal Strategy
1. **Alice's Goal**: Maximize the MEX of `c`.
2. **Bob's Goal**: Minimize the MEX of `c`.

### Key Observations
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
- If Alice can ensure that the smallest missing number in `c` is as large as possible by the end of the game, she wins.
- Bob will try to prevent this by removing elements that Alice might use to increase the MEX.

### Correct Approach
To find the final MEX, we need to determine which numbers are present in the array `a` and how many times each number appears. The optimal strategy involves:
- Alice adding numbers to `c` such that the smallest missing number is maximized.
- Bob removing numbers that would help Alice achieve a higher MEX.

### Analysis of the Provided Program
The provided program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each number in `a`. It then iterates through the numbers from `0` to `n-1` to find the smallest number that either does not appear in `a` or appears only once (after Alice's turn).

However, the logic in the program is flawed:
- The program checks if a number is not in `mpp.keys()` (i.e., does not appear in `a`), and if so, prints that number as the MEX.
- If a number appears only once, it also prints that number as the MEX, but only after a flag `first` is set to `True`.

### Flaws in the Program
1. **Incorrect Handling of Single Occurrences**: The program incorrectly assumes that the first number appearing only once should be the MEX. This is not necessarily true because Bob can remove this number.
2. **Ignoring Bob's Moves**: The program does not account for Bob's moves, which can significantly affect the final MEX.
3. **Incorrect Logic for MEX Calculation**: The program does not correctly simulate the game or account for the optimal strategies of both players.

### Correctness
Given the flaws in the program's logic and its failure to correctly simulate the game and account for both players' optimal strategies, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
