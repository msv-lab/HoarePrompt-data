### Reasoning:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by determining the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends. However, the logic in the code does not correctly implement the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:
1. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array. The code tries to find this by iterating through the numbers and checking their presence in the array, but it does not correctly simulate the game where Alice and Bob are making optimal moves.
2. **Optimal Moves**: Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she should try to add higher numbers to `c` whenever possible. Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he should try to add lower numbers to `c` or prevent Alice from adding higher numbers.
3. **Logic in the Code**: The code checks for the first missing number or the first unique number after another unique number, but this does not align with the optimal strategies of the players.

A correct approach would involve:
- Counting the occurrences of each number.
- Simulating the game where Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice trying to maximize the MEX and Bob trying to minimize it.
- The correct MEX can be determined by considering the counts of each number and simulating the game accordingly.

### Correctness:
The provided code does not correctly simulate the game or determine the MEX based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
