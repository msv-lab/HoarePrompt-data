Given the initial state, we know the following:
- `i` is explicitly set to 1.
- `n` is mentioned to be greater than 1, but its exact value is not specified.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print(i)
```

Since `i` is explicitly defined as 1, the `print` statement will output the value of `i`.

Output: **1**
