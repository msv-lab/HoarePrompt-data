Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 2`, `i` is `i + 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `i` has been updated to `i + 2`. The condition `n` must be greater than `i + 2` is still valid. The `break` statement indicates that we exit the most internal loop or if statement. No other variables are affected.
