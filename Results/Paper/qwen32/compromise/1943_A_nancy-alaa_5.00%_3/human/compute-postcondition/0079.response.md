Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is not a key in the dictionary `mpp`.

The provided code snippet is:
```python
print(i)
```

We need to determine what will be printed when this statement executes.

Since `i` is explicitly stated to be 0, the `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
