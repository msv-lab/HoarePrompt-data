Given the initial state:

- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
- `first` is initially set to `False`.
- The current value of `i` is a key in `mpp` with a frequency of 1, and `first` is set to `True`.

The `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i`, which is a key in the `Counter` object `mpp` with a frequency of 1.

Since `i` is explicitly defined as a key in `mpp` with a frequency of 1, we can determine that `i` is one of the unique integers in the list `arr`.

Output: **i (where i is a unique integer in the list `arr` with a frequency of 1)**
