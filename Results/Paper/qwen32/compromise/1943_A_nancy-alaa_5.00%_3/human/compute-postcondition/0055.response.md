Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the condition that `n` must be greater than `i + 1` remains unchanged. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
