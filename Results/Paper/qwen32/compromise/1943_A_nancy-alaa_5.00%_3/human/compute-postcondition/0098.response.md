The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2**
