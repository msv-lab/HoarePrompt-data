The code snippet `mpp = Counter(arr)` creates a new variable `mpp` which is a `Counter` object. This `Counter` object counts the frequency of each element in the list `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in `arr`.**
