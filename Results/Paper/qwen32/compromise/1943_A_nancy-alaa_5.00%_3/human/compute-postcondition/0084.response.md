The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional structure it is contained within. In this case, the values of the variables `i`, `n`, `mpp`, and `first` do not change. The only change is the program's flow due to the `break` statement, which means we are exiting the loop or conditional structure.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp`, `mpp[i]` is 1, and `first` is True; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
