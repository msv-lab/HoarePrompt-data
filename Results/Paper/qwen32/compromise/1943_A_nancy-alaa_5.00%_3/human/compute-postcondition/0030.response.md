Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2 · 10^4.
- `n` is greater than `i + 1`.
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in `arr`.
- `first` is a boolean value (its value is not specified).
- `i` is `i + 1`. This means `i` has been incremented by 1 before the `print(i)` statement.
- If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(i)` statement will output the value of the variable `i`. From the initial state, we know that `i` has been incremented by 1 before this statement. However, the exact value of `i` before the increment is not provided. Therefore, we can only describe the value of `i` in terms of its state before the increment.

Let's denote the value of `i` before the increment as `i_prev`. After the increment, `i` becomes `i_prev + 1`.

Since `i` is incremented just before the `print(i)` statement, the value printed will be `i_prev + 1`.

### Output:
The `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i` after it has been incremented by 1. The exact numerical value of `i_prev` is not provided, so we describe the output in terms of `i_prev`.

Output: **i_prev + 1 (where i_prev is the value of i before the increment)**
