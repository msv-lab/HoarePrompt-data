The `break` statement will terminate the innermost loop or conditional block it is placed in, but it does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The Output State is: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
