Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this specific task.
   - `n`: The first integer read from the input. It represents the number of elements in the list `a`.
   - `k`: Initially, `k` is updated to a certain value based on a formula involving the list `a`, but then it is set to 0. Since `k` is set to 0, it does not affect the print statement.
   - `a`: A sorted list of integers read from the input. The length of this list is `n`.
   - `r`: The last element of the list `a`, i.e., `a[n - 1]`.
   - `rem`: Set to 0.
   - `y`: Set to 0.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   ```python
   print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)
   ```

   - `r - 1`: This is the last element of the list `a` minus 1.
   - `(r - 1) * n`: This is the result of multiplying `r - 1` by the number of elements in the list `a`.
   - `(r - 1) * n + 1`: Adding 1 to the previous result.
   - `rem`: This is 0.
   - `y`: This is 0.
   - Therefore, the expression simplifies to `(r - 1) * n + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. Calculate `r - 1` where `r` is the last element of the sorted list `a`.
2. Multiply the result by `n` (the number of elements in the list).
3. Add 1 to the product.
4. Since `rem` and `y` are both 0, they do not change the result.

### Final Expression:

The expression `(r - 1) * n + 1` is the final value that will be printed.

### Output:

Given the above analysis, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **(r - 1) * n + 1 (where r is the last element of the sorted list a and n is the number of elements in the list a)**
