The only object in the loop head is the variable `ii`. The loop will execute as long as `ii` is less than the value provided by `int(input())`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `ii` by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, the values of `k`, `r`, `rem`, and `y` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head. The only change needed is to the loop variable `ii`.

State: **`k`, `r`, `rem`, and `y` are defined as per the conditions given, `ii` is incremented by 1**.

To provide a more concrete example, let's assume the value of `ii` at the end of the previous iteration was `x`. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `ii` would be `x + 1`.

State: **`k`, `r`, `rem`, and `y` are defined as per the conditions given, `ii` is `x + 1`**

Since the exact value of `ii` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we can generalize it as:

State: **`k`, `r`, `rem`, and `y` are defined as per the conditions given, `ii` is incremented by 1**
