To determine what will be printed by the `print((r - 1) * n + 1)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the expression step by step.

### Initial State Recap:
- `k` is not equal to 0.
- `r` is defined as `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
- `rem` is either 0 if the loop completes all iterations or `k % (i + 1)` if the loop does not complete.
- `y` is either 0 if the loop completes all iterations or `n - 1 - i` if the loop does not complete.

### Expression Analysis:
The expression to evaluate is `(r - 1) * n + 1`.

1. **Determine `r`:**
   - `r` is defined as `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
   - Here, `a[n - 1]` is the last element of the list `a`.
   - `k // n` is the integer division of `k` by `n`.

2. **Substitute `r` into the expression:**
   - The expression becomes `((a[n - 1] + k // n) - 1) * n + 1`.
   - Simplify inside the parentheses: `(a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1`.

3. **Further simplification:**
   - Distribute `n` across the terms inside the parentheses: `(a[n - 1] * n + (k // n) * n - n) + 1`.
   - Since `(k // n) * n` is equivalent to the largest multiple of `n` less than or equal to `k`, it simplifies to `k - (k % n)`.
   - Therefore, the expression becomes: `(a[n - 1] * n + k - (k % n) - n) + 1`.

### Final Output:
The final expression to be printed is `(a[n - 1] * n + k - (k % n) - n) + 1`.

Given the initial state, we do not have specific values for `a[n - 1]`, `k`, or `n`, so we describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(a[n - 1] * n + k - (k % n) - n) + 1 (where a[n - 1] is the last element of the list a, k is not equal to 0, and n is the length of the list a)**
