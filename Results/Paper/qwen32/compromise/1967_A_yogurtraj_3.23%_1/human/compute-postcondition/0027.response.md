To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

From the loop statement:
```
for i in range(0, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it means that `i` at the start of the next iteration will be the same as `i` at the end of the previous iteration.

Thus, the only variable that needs adjustment is `i`. The variable `n` remains unchanged because it is the upper bound of the loop and does not change within the loop iterations.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is incremented by 1** (which means `i` at the start of the next iteration is the same as `i` at the end of the previous iteration).

However, to be precise, let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_end`. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end + 1`.

So, if `i` was `i_end` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_end + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is `i_end + 1`** (where `i_end` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration). 

But since we don't have the exact value of `i_end`, we can generalize it as:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is incremented by 1** (implying `i` is now `i + 1` from the previous iteration).

For clarity, if we assume `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is incremented by 1**. 

Or more precisely:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`**.
