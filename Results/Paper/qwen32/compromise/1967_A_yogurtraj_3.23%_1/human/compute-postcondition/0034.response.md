The code snippet assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to the variable `r`. This means that `r` now holds the value of the element at index `i + 1` in the list `a`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and `k`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.

After executing the code snippet, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is `a[i + 1]`.**
