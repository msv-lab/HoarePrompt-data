The code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `r`. Specifically, it sets `r` to `a[n - 1] + k // n`. This means the previous definition of `r` (which depended on whether the loop completed or not) is overridden.

The values of `k`, `a`, `n`, `rem`, and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`k` is not equal to 0, `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`, `rem` is either 0 if the loop completes all iterations or `k % (i + 1)` if the loop does not complete, and `y` is either 0 if the loop completes all iterations or `n - 1 - i` if the loop does not complete.**
