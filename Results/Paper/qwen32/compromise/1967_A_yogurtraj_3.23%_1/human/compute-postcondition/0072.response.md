Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is either 0 or `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is either `n - 1 - i` or 0, `ii` is the current value of `ii` plus 1, `a` is the sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 2.**

Explanation: The value of `rem` is updated to be `k % (i + 1)`. All other variables retain their previous values as specified in the initial state.
