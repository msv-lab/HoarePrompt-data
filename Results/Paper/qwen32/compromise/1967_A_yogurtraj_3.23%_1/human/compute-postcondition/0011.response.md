The value of `y` is updated to `n - 1 - i`. All other variables retain their initial values as they are not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, and `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`.**
