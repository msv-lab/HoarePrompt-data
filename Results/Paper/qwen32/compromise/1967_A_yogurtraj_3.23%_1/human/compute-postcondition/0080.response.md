Postcondition: **`k` is not equal to 0, `r` is either `a[n - 1]` if the loop completes all iterations or `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` if the loop does not complete, `rem` is either 0 if the loop completes all iterations or `k % (i + 1)` if the loop does not complete, and `y` is either 0 if the loop completes all iterations or `n - 1 - i` if the loop does not complete.**
