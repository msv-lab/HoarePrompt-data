The given code snippet processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then computes the sum of the maximum value in the first `n-1` elements and the last element of the list, and prints this sum.

Since the code processes each test case independently and the state of variables `t`, `n`, and the list `nums` are reset at the start of each loop iteration, the final output state is simply the printed results for all `t` test cases. The variables `t`, `n`, and `nums` do not retain their values after the loop completes.

Output State: **The output state consists of `t` lines, each containing the sum of the maximum value in the first `n-1` elements and the last element of the list for each respective test case.**
