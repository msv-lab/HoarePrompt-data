Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis

The task requires dividing the books into two non-empty piles and selecting the book with the maximum number of pages from each pile. The goal is to maximize the total number of pages read from the two selected books.

### Program Analysis

The provided program reads the input for multiple test cases and for each test case:
1. It reads the number of books `n`.
2. It reads the list of pages in each book `nums`.
3. It calculates the maximum number of pages in the list except the last book (`max(nums[:-1])`) and adds the number of pages in the last book (`nums[-1]`).
4. It prints the result.

### Flaws in the Program

The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the total number of pages read. Here is why:

- The program simply takes the maximum of all books except the last and adds the last book's pages. This does not guarantee that the two books selected are from two non-empty piles.
- It does not consider all possible ways to divide the books into two piles and select the maximum pages from each pile.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Find the two largest numbers in the list of pages.
2. The sum of these two largest numbers will give the maximum total number of pages Alice can read, as these two books can be in separate piles.

### Correct Implementation

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Find the two largest numbers in the list
        nums.sort()
        max1 = nums[-1]
        max2 = nums[-2]
        print(max1 + max2)

# Example usage
# func()
```

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
