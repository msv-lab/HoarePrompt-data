Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be at least 2 and even, `p` is a list of `n` elements where the first `n-2` elements are 0, the element at index `n-2` is `n-4`, and the last element is `n-2`, `ind` is `n - 6`, `i` is `n - 2`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive. `n` remains an even integer of at least 2. The list `p` keeps its structure with the first `n-2` elements as 0, the element at index `n-2` as `n-4`, and the last element as `n-2`. The variable `ind` is decremented by 2, so it becomes `n - 6`. The variable `i` remains unchanged as `n - 2`.
