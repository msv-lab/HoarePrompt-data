The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n`. For each test case, it constructs and prints a list `p` of length `n` such that even-indexed elements are filled in descending order starting from `n`, and odd-indexed elements are filled in ascending order starting from `1` or `2` depending on whether `n` is odd or even.
