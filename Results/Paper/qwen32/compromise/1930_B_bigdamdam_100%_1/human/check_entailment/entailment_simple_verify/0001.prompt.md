You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        p = [0] * n
        ind = n
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
        ind = 1 + n % 2
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
        print(*p)

    #State: For each test case, the list `p` is constructed such that `p[2j] = n - 2j` for even indices `2j < n` and `p[2j+1] = 1 + 4k` for odd indices `2j+1 < n` where `k` is the index of the odd position starting from 0. The value of `t` remains the same.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it generates a valid permutation for each test case according to the problem's requirements.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Permutation Requirement**: The output should be a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.
2. **Condition to Satisfy**: For all pairs of indices (i, j) such that 1 ≤ i, j < n and i ≠ j, it should not be the case that both p[i] divides p[j] and p[i+1] divides p[j+1].

### Program Analysis

The program generates a permutation by:
- First placing the largest numbers in the even indices (0, 2, 4, ...).
- Then placing the smallest numbers in the odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...).

Let's examine the logic step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `p = [0] * n`: Creates a list `p` of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0.
   - `ind = n`: Initializes `ind` to `n`.

2. **Filling Even Indices**:
   - `for i in range(0, n, 2)`: Iterates over even indices.
   - `p[i] = ind`: Assigns the current value of `ind` to the current even index.
   - `ind -= 2`: Decreases `ind` by 2 for the next iteration.

3. **Filling Odd Indices**:
   - `ind = 1 + n % 2`: Initializes `ind` to 1 if `n` is odd, and to 2 if `n` is even.
   - `for i in range(1, n, 2)`: Iterates over odd indices.
   - `p[i] = ind`: Assigns the current value of `ind` to the current odd index.
   - `ind += 2`: Increases `ind` by 2 for the next iteration.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's consider the example from the problem statement:

- **Input**: `n = 4`
- **Generated Permutation**: `p = [4, 1, 2, 3]`

Let's verify if this permutation satisfies the condition:
- For i=0, j=2: `p[0]=4`, `p[2]=2`. 4 does not divide 2.
- For i=0, j=3: `p[0]=4`, `p[3]=3`. 4 does not divide 3.
- For i=1, j=3: `p[1]=1`, `p[3]=3`. 1 divides 3, but `p[2]=2` does not divide `p[4]` (out of bounds).
- For i=1, j=2: `p[1]=1`, `p[2]=2`. 1 divides 2, but `p[2]=2` does not divide `p[3]=3`.

Since none of the pairs violate the condition, the generated permutation is valid.

### Generalization

The program places the largest numbers in even indices and the smallest numbers in odd indices. This strategy ensures that for any pair of indices (i, j) where i and j are either both even or both odd, the condition is satisfied because the numbers are either strictly decreasing or strictly increasing, respectively. For mixed indices (one even, one odd), the condition is also satisfied because the numbers are sufficiently different in magnitude.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly generates a valid permutation for each test case according to the problem's requirements.
