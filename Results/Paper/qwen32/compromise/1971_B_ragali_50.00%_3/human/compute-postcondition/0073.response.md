Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`input_string.strip(' ')`**: This removes any leading or trailing spaces from `input_string`.
2. **`s`**: This is constructed by taking the second half of `input_string.strip(' ')` and appending the first half to it. This effectively rotates the string by half its length.
3. **`a`**: This is a set of all unique characters in `input_string.strip(' ')` that appear more than once. However, this variable is not used in the print statement.
4. **`i`**: This is the last character of `input_string.strip(' ')`. Again, this variable is not used in the print statement.
5. **`t`**: This variable remains unchanged but is not used in the print statement.
6. **`isreverse`**: This is the reversed string of `s`. However, this variable is not used in the print statement.
7. **`newstr`**: This is equal to `s`. However, this variable is not used in the print statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement takes the second half of `s` (`s[len(s) // 2:]`) and appends the first half of `s` (`s[0:len(s) // 2]`) to it.
- Since `s` is already constructed by rotating `input_string.strip(' ')` by half its length, performing this operation on `s` will rotate it back to its original form.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the original string `input_string.strip(' ')`.

### Output:
Output: **input_string.strip(' ')** (where `input_string.strip(' ')` is the input string with leading and trailing spaces removed)
