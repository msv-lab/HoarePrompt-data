Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000. This detail is not directly relevant to the print statement, as `t` is not used in the print statement.
- `s` is a non-empty input string with leading and trailing spaces removed. This means `s` is a string with no leading or trailing spaces.
- `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the string `s`. The set `a` contains exactly one unique character. This implies that the string `s` consists of the same character repeated one or more times.

The print statement is:
```
print('NO')
```

This print statement directly outputs the string 'NO'. The variables `t`, `s`, and `a` are not used in the print statement, so their values do not affect the output.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
