The code snippet `s = input().strip(' ')` assigns a new value to `s` by taking an input string and removing any leading and trailing spaces. The variables `a`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `s` already has a value that is a non-empty input string with leading and trailing spaces removed. The new `s` value will be determined by the new input provided, but since we are not given a specific new input, we will denote the new input string as `input_string.strip(' ')`.

The set `a` is based on the unique characters of the original `s`, and it will not change unless `s` changes, which it does in this case. Therefore, `a` will now be a set of unique characters from the new `s`.

The variable `i` is incremented by 1, so its value will be one more than its previous value.

The variable `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is `input_string.strip(' ')`, `a` is a set of unique characters from `s`, `i` is incremented by 1, `t` remains unchanged.**
