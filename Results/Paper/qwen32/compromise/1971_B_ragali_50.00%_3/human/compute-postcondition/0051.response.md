To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **String `s`**: 
   - It is a non-empty string with leading and trailing spaces removed.
   
2. **Set `a`**:
   - It contains all unique characters from the string `s`.
   - The length of `a` is 1 or less. This means that `s` can either be an empty string (which contradicts the non-empty condition) or a string consisting of one unique character repeated any number of times.

3. **Character `i`**:
   - It is the last character in the string `s` to be processed.
   - Given the length condition of `a`, `i` will be the unique character in `s` if `s` has only one unique character.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement directly prints the string `'NO'`.
- The values of `s`, `a`, and `i` do not influence the output of this specific print statement because the statement is hardcoded to print `'NO'`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output `'NO'` regardless of the specific values of `s`, `a`, and `i`.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
