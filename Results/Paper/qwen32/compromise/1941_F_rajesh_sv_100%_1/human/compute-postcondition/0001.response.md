The only variable in the loop head is `testcases`, which is determined by the return value of `func_3()`. For the loop to execute, `testcases` must be greater than 0. The state of `testcases` is the only thing we can adjust to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()` and must be greater than 0**
