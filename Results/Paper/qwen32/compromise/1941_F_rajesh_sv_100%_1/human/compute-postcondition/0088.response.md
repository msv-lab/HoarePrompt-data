Postcondition: **`A` is a sorted list of n integers, `m` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers with at least 2 elements, `F` is equal to `D`, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` that, when subtracted by its previous element, gives the maximum difference, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `f` is the second element of `F`, `l` is equal to `h`, and `ans` is the minimum of `max_diff`, `D[l] + f - left`, and `right - D[l] - f`.**

Since the else part is not provided and the if condition is `l == h`, the postcondition remains the same as the initial state described in the precondition when `l == h`.
