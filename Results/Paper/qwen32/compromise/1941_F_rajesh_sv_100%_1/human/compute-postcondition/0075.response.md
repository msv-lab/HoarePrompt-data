The code snippet provided reassigns the values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` using the expressions `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f`, respectively. Since these expressions are already used to define `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` in the initial state, the values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged after the code executes.

Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State with respect to the variables `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum`.

Output State: **`A` is a sorted list of n integers, `m` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers with at least 2 elements, `F` is equal to `D`, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` that, when subtracted by its previous element, gives the maximum difference, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `f` is the second element of `F`, `l` must be less than `h`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`**.
