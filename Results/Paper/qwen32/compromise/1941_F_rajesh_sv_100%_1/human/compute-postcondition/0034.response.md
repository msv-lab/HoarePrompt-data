Output State: **`A` is a sorted list of n integers, `m` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers returned by func_4(), `F` is equal to `D`, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` that, when subtracted by its previous element, gives the maximum difference, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is `max_diff`.**

In this output state, the variable `ans` has been assigned the value of `max_diff`. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
