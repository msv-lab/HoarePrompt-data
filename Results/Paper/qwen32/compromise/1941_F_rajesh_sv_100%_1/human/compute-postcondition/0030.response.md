Postcondition: **`A` is a sorted list of `n` integers representing the complexities of the prepared problems; `m` is unchanged; `k` is unchanged; `D` is a sorted list of unique integers returned by `func_4()`, and `F` is equal to `D`; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 5; `diff` is `A[5] - A[4]`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `A[5] - A[4]` and `index` is set to 5. If `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[5] - A[4]`. Otherwise, `next_max_diff` remains unchanged.**
