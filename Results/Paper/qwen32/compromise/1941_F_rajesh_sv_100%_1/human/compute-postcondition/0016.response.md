The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to reflect the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 3 (for example, if it was the third iteration), and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, and `n` remains unchanged.

Let's assume `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration. At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 4. The value of `n` remains the same since it is the upper bound of the loop.

State: **`A` is a sorted list of `n` integers representing the complexities of the prepared problems; `m` is unchanged; `k` is unchanged; `D` is a sorted list of unique integers returned by `func_4()`, and `F` is equal to `D`; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 4; `diff` is `A[i] - A[i - 1]`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `diff`, `next_max_diff` remains `-inf`, and `index` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `max_diff` remains unchanged, `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, and `index` remains `None`.**
