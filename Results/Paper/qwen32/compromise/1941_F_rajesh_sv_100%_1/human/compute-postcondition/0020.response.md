The code assigns the value of `i` to `index`. No other variables are changed by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`A` is a sorted list of `n` integers representing the complexities of the prepared problems; `m` is unchanged; `k` is unchanged; `D` is a sorted list of unique integers returned by `func_4()`, and `F` is equal to `D`; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 4; `diff` is `A[4] - A[3]`; `next_max_diff` is equal to `max_diff`; `max_diff` is `A[4] - A[3]`; `index` is 4.**
