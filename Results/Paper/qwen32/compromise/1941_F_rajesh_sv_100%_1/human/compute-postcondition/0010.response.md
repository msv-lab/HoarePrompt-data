The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to the variable `index`. None of the other variables are changed by this assignment.

Output State: **`A` is a sorted list of `n` integers representing the complexities of the prepared problems; `m` is unchanged; `k` is unchanged; `D` is a sorted list of unique integers returned by `func_4()`, and `F` is equal to `D`; `max_diff` is `A[i] - A[i - 1]`; `next_max_diff` is `-inf`; `index` is `i`; `n` must be greater than 1; `diff` is `A[i] - A[i - 1]`.**
