To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing all iterations, we need to analyze what the code does for each iteration.

The loop iterates `t` times, and in each iteration:
1. It reads two integers `n` and `k`.
2. It checks if `k` is equal to `4 * n - 2`.
   - If true, it prints `k // 2 + 1`.
   - If false, it prints `ceil(k / 2)`, which can be written as `(k + 1) // 2` in integer arithmetic.

The output for each iteration is either `k // 2 + 1` or `(k + 1) // 2`, depending on the value of `k`.

The output state will consist of `t` lines, each containing the result of the computation for the corresponding input pair `(n, k)`.

Output State: **For each of the `t` lines, the output will be either `k // 2 + 1` if `k == 4 * n - 2`, or `(k + 1) // 2` otherwise.**
