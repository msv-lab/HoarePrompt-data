Let's break down the given initial state and the code step by step to determine the output of the `print` statement.

### Initial State:
- `i` is defined as `x - 2`.
- `num` is defined as `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`.
- If `num` equals 1, then `count` is the number of times `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1` was 1 for `i` from `0` to `x - 2` plus 1.
- Otherwise, `count` is the number of times `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1` was 1 for `i` from `0` to `x - 2`.
- The `print` statement is `print(count + x - 2)`.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Determine `i`:**
   - `i` is `x - 2`.

2. **Determine `num`:**
   - `num` is calculated as `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`.
   - This value is used to determine the value of `count`.

3. **Determine `count`:**
   - `count` is the number of times the expression `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1` equals 1 for `i` ranging from `0` to `x - 2`.
   - If `num` equals 1, `count` is incremented by 1.

4. **Determine the `print` statement:**
   - The `print` statement is `print(count + x - 2)`.
   - This means we need to calculate the value of `count + x - 2`.

### Output Calculation:
- The final printed value is `count + x - 2`.

### Final Output:
The output depends on the values of `count`, `x`, and the specific values in `list0` and `n`. However, based on the given information, the output can be precisely described as:

Output: **count + x - 2 (where count is the number of times list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1 equals 1 for i from 0 to x - 2, incremented by 1 if num equals 1, and x is the given value)**
