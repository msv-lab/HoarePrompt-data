Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `x` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 2, `y` is the third integer read from the input, The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `list0` is a list containing `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` sorted in ascending order; `i` is `x - 1`, `count` is the total number of times `num` equals 1, where `num` is calculated as `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1` for each `i` from 0 to `x - 2`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `x - 1`, meaning the loop has gone through all the pairs of consecutive elements in `list0`. The variable `count` will hold the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` is exactly 2 (since `num` is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`, `num` being 1 means `list0[i + 1]` is exactly 1 more than `list0[i]`, which implies the difference between them is 2). All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state except for `i` and `count`.
