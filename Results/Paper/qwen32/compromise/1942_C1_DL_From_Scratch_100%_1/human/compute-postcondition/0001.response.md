The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `T`, so we can only adjust those. The loop will execute if `T` is at least 1. The current state already specifies that `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, which means the loop can execute as is without any adjustments to `T`. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of integers are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 * 10^5), `y` is 0, The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**
