The code snippet calculates the value of `num` as the difference between the element at index `i + 1` and the element at index `i` in the list `list0`, minus 1. The value of `x` is not affected by this operation and remains at least 2.

Output State: **`x` must be at least 2; `num` is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`.**
