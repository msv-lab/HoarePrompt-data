Output State: **`cur` is equal to `i` before `i` was incremented; `i` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
The value of `cur` remains as it was initially equal to `i` before `i` was incremented. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 as specified. The execution is interrupted by a `break` statement, which exits the most internal loop or if statement.
