Output State: **`T` is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers; `cur` is the last number in `N` that was greater than the previous `cur` value plus 1; `M` is a dictionary containing the count of each unique number in `N`. The sum of the counts of all unique numbers in `M` equals `S`.**

In natural language: The value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `T`, `S`, `N`, and `M` remain unchanged.
