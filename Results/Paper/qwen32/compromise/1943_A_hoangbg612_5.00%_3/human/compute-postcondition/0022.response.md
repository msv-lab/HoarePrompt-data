The code snippet assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. This change affects the value of `cur` directly, while the other variables remain unchanged. Since `num` is the next integer in the sorted list `N`, the value of `cur` will now be equal to `num`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers that has at least 1 integer; `num` is the next integer in `N`; `cur` is equal to `num`.**
