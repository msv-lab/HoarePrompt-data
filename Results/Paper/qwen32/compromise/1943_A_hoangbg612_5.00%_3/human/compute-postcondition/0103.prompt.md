Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is the sorted list of integers, `cur` is the last number processed in `N` plus 1 if the sum of the values in the dictionary `M` is equal to `S`. Otherwise, `cur` remains the last number processed in `N`. `M` is a dictionary with keys as consecutive integers starting from the smallest number in `N` and values as their counts in `N`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cur):
    if M[i] <= i:
        cur = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, the last number processed in `N` is at least 0, `M` is a dictionary with keys as consecutive integers starting from the smallest number in `N` and values as their counts in `N`, `S` is an input integer, and `cur` is greater than 0. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, then `cur` is set to `i` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, the last number processed in `N` is at least 0, `M` is a dictionary with keys as consecutive integers starting from the smallest number in `N` and values as their counts in `N`, `S` is an input integer, and `cur` is 0 if `M[i] <= i`, otherwise `cur` remains greater than 0. `i` is 0. If `M[i] <= i`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, the last number processed in `N` is at least 0, `M` is a dictionary with keys as consecutive integers starting from the smallest number in `N` and values as their counts in `N`, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to the next part of the code.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
