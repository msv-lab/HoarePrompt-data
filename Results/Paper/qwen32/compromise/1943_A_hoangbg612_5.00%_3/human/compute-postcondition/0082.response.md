The code snippet `cur = num` assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. The conditions and values of `T`, `S`, `N`, `M`, and the logic related to `cur + 1` are still valid as per the initial state. 

Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least two elements, `M` is a dictionary, `num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is `num`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cur`, and the loop or if statement continues.**
