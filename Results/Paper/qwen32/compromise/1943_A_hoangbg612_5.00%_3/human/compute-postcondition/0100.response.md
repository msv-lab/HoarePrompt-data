The code snippet `cur = i` assigns the value of `i` to `cur`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `cur` will be set to 1. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, the last number processed in `N` is at least 0, `M` is a dictionary with keys as consecutive integers starting from the smallest number in `N` and values as their counts in `N`, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is 1, `i` is 1**.
