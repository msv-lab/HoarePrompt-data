Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `N` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input; `S` is an input integer; `M` is an empty dictionary; `cur` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for num in N:
    if num > cur:
        if num > cur + 1:
            cur += 1
            break
        cur = num
        M[cur] = 1
    else:
        M[cur] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `N` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input and must have at least one element; `S` is an input integer; `M` is a dictionary. If `num > cur`, then `M` has one entry `{cur: 1}` and `cur` is set to `num`. If `num > cur + 1`, `cur` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` remains -1. If `num <= cur`, then `M` has one entry `{-1: 1}` and `cur` remains -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `N` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input and must have at least one element; `S` is an input integer; `M` is a dictionary; `num` is the next element in the list `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `M` has `cur` as a key with a value of `1` and `cur` is updated to `num`. Otherwise, the count of `num` in `M` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `N` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input and must have at least one element; `S` is an input integer; `M` is a dictionary; `num` is the next element in the list `N` after the current `num`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, `M` maps `cur` to `1` and `cur` is updated to `num`. Otherwise, `M` increments the value of `cur` by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
