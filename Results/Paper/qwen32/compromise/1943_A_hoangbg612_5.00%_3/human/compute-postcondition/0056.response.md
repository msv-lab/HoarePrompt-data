The code snippet `N.sort()` sorts the list `N` in ascending order. The values of `T`, `S`, and `cur` remain unchanged. The only change is in the list `N`, which now contains the same integers but in sorted order.

Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is the sorted list of integers from the input, `cur` remains the smallest index `i` such that `M[i] <= i`, or if no such `i` exists within the range, `cur` remains unchanged from its initial value.**
