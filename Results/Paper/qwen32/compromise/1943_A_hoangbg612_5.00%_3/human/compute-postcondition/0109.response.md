The code snippet `cur = -1` simply assigns the value `-1` to the variable `cur`. This does not affect the values of `N`, `S`, or `M`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input; `S` is an input integer; `M` is a dictionary with keys as consecutive integers starting from the smallest number in the original `N` and values as their counts in the original `N`; `cur` is -1.**
