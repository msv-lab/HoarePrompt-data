Postcondition: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least two elements, `M` is a dictionary, `num` is the next element in `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cur`, and the loop or if statement continues.**
