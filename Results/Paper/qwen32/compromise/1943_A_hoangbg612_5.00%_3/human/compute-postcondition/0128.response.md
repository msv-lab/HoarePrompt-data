The code snippet `M[cur] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `cur` in the dictionary `M` by 1. Given the initial state, `N` is a sorted list of integers, `S` is an input integer, `M` is a dictionary, and `num` is the next element in the list `N`, the variable `cur` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the code snippet would result in a `KeyError` if `cur` does not already exist in `M`. Since `cur` is not provided in the initial state, we can assume that the code is intended to work with a `cur` that is defined elsewhere in the program, possibly as an element from `N` or `num`.

Assuming `cur` is intended to be `num` (the next element in the list `N`), the code would increment the count of `num` in the dictionary `M` by 1. If `num` is not already a key in `M`, it would be added with a value of 1.

Given this assumption, the output state would be:

Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input and must have at least one element; `S` is an input integer; `M` is a dictionary where the count of `num` (the next element in the list `N`) is incremented by 1; `num` is the next element in the list `N`.**
