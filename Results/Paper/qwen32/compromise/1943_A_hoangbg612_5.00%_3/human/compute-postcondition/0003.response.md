The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `N`. The values of `T` and `S` remain unchanged by this code.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
