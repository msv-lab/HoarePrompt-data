The given code snippet is `M[cur] += 1`. This line of code increments the value associated with the key `cur` in the dictionary `M` by 1. 

From the initial state, we know:
- `T` is `T-1` (which seems like a placeholder or a typo, as it doesn't make sense for a variable to be defined in terms of itself minus one. We will assume `T` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified).
- `S` is an input integer (unchanged).
- `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements (unchanged).
- `M` is a dictionary (modified).
- `num` is the next element in `N` (unchanged).

The variable `cur` is not defined in the initial state, which means this code snippet would raise a `KeyError` if `cur` is not a key in `M`. Assuming `cur` is a valid key in `M`, the value of `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least two elements, `M` is a dictionary with the value of `M[cur]` incremented by 1, `num` is the next element in `N`.**
