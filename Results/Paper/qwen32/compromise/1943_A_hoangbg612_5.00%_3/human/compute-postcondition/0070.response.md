The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`, which is used to iterate over the sorted list `N`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `num` to the next element in the list `N`. The other variables `T`, `S`, `N`, and `M` should remain as they are, since they are not part of the loop head.

Given that `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, and `num` is the current element being processed, at the start of the next iteration, `num` should be the next element in `N`.

Let's denote the current value of `num` as `N[j]`. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `num` should be `N[j+1]`.

State: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `M` is a dictionary, `num` is `N[j+1]`**

However, since we don't have the specific index `j` of the current `num` in the list `N`, we can simply denote the next value in `N` as the next element after the current `num`.

State: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `M` is a dictionary, `num` is the next element in `N`**
