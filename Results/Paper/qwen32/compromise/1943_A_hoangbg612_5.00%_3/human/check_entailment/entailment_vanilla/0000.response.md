Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` and appending them to another array `c` (only Alice does this), until `a` is empty. The goal is to determine the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c` when both players play optimally.

### Key Points:
1. **Alice's Goal**: Maximize the MEX of `c`.
2. **Bob's Goal**: Minimize the MEX of `c`.
3. **MEX**: The smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Strategy:
- Alice and Bob will play optimally, meaning Alice will always try to increase the MEX, and Bob will try to decrease it.
- The MEX of `c` can be determined by the smallest number not present in `c` after all elements from `a` have been processed.

### Program Analysis:
The program attempts to determine the MEX of `c` by following these steps:
1. **Sorting**: The array `N` (which is a copy of `a`) is sorted.
2. **Tracking Numbers**: A dictionary `M` is used to track the count of each number in `N`.
3. **Finding MEX**: It iterates through the sorted numbers and tries to find the smallest number not present or not sufficiently counted to match its index.

### Detailed Steps:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `T` and for each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.
2. **Sorting**: The array `N` is sorted.
3. **Tracking Numbers**: A dictionary `M` is used to count occurrences of each number.
4. **Finding MEX**:
   - It initializes `cur` to `-1` and iterates through the sorted numbers.
   - If a number is greater than `cur + 1`, it means `cur + 1` is missing, so it breaks out of the loop.
   - If the number is equal to `cur + 1`, it increments `cur` and continues.
   - After the loop, if all numbers up to `cur` are present and counted appropriately, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - Finally, it checks if any number `i` from `0` to `cur` is not present or not counted enough times, and sets `cur` to that number.

### Issues:
- **Optimal Play**: The program does not explicitly simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. It assumes that the sorted order and counting will give the correct MEX.
- **Handling Duplicates**: The program does not correctly handle the case where numbers are duplicated and need to be counted multiple times.
- **Final MEX Calculation**: The logic for determining the final MEX is flawed. It does not correctly account for the optimal moves of both players.

### Correctness:
The program does not correctly simulate the optimal play of both players and does not correctly calculate the MEX based on the rules of the game.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
