The only variables in the loop head are `y` and the range parameters (`x - 1`, `0`, `-1`). Therefore, we can only adjust those ones to ensure the loop can execute.

For the loop to execute, the range must be valid, meaning the start value (`x - 1`) must be greater than or equal to the stop value (`0`). Since the step is `-1`, the loop will decrement `y` from `x - 1` down to `1` (inclusive).

Given that `x` is the next element in `test_cases` and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements where each integer `x` satisfies `2 <= x <= 1000`, we can ensure that `x - 1` will always be at least `1`, making the loop executable.

Thus, the state before the loop should include ensuring `x` is such that `x - 1` is at least `1`, which is already guaranteed by the problem constraints.

Therefore, the state does not need further adjustment for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`**
