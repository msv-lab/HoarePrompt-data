The given code snippet assigns the value of `y` to `best_y`. However, the value of `y` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine a specific value for `best_y` after the assignment. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases` with an additional `1` appended, `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum` and both are 2, `best_y` is `y`, `x` is the next element in `test_cases` and must be at least 2, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is 2.**
