Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases`, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing for all the elements in `test_cases`, `results` will contain the `best_y` value for each corresponding `x` in `test_cases`. The variables `max_sum` and `best_y` will be reset to 0 and 1, respectively, as they are not retained outside the loop for each `x`. The values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
