The only variable in the loop head is `y`. According to the loop statement, `y` starts from `x - 1` and decrements by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements
- `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`
- `x` is the next element in `test_cases`
- `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`
- `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`
- `y` is decremented by 1 from its previous value
- If `current_sum` was greater than `max_sum`, `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `best_y` is updated to `y`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `y` should be decremented by 1 from its current value, provided it is still greater than 0.

Let's denote the value of `y` at the end of the previous iteration as `y_prev`. For the loop to execute again, `y` should be set to `y_prev - 1` and it must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`, `y` is `y_prev - 1` where `y_prev` is the value of `y` at the end of the previous iteration and `y_prev - 1` > 0**
