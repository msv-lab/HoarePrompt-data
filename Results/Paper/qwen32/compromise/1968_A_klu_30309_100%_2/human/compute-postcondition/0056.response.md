The given code snippet sets `max_sum` to 0. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change while keeping all other variables in their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases` with an additional `1` appended, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`**.
