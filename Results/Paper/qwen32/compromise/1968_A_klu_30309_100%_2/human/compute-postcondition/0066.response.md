The only variable in the loop head is `y`. According to the loop statement, `y` starts from `x - 1` and decrements by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `y` has just completed an iteration and is about to decrement. Therefore, to adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to decrement `y` by 1.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `y` was some value.
- The loop decrements `y` by 1 in each iteration.
- Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `y` should be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `y` at the end of the previous iteration, we can assume that `y` was at some value `k` and is now `k - 1` at the start of the next iteration.

However, we know that `y` starts from `x - 1` and decrements by 1 each time. So, if `y` was `x - 1` in the first iteration, then in the next iteration, `y` should be `x - 2`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases` with an additional `1` appended, `best_y` is `y` if `current_sum` was greater than `max_sum`, otherwise `best_y` remains 1, `x` is the next element in `test_cases` and must be at least 2, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is 2, `max_sum` is 2, `y` is `x - 2`**
