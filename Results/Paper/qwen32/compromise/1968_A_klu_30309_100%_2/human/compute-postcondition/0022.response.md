The code snippet assigns the value of `current_sum` to `max_sum`. This means that `max_sum` is updated to the value of `current_sum`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 1 element, `results` is an empty list, `x` is at least 2, `y` is `y`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `max_sum` is `current_sum`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
