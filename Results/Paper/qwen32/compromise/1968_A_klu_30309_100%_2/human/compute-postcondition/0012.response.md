The only variable in the loop head is `y`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates over the range starting from `x - 1` down to `1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means that `y` is decremented by `1` in each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `y` was some value, and for the loop to execute again, `y` must be decremented by `1` and still be greater than or equal to `1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 1 element
- `results` is an empty list
- `max_sum` is the maximum value between the original `max_sum` and `current_sum`
- `best_y` is `y` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`
- `x` is at least 2
- `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`
- `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`
- If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, the loop or if statement is broken out of

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to decrement `y` by `1`:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 1 element, `results` is an empty list, `max_sum` is the maximum value between the original `max_sum` and `current_sum`, `best_y` is `y` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `x` is at least 2, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, and `y` is decremented by 1**.

Since we only adjust `y` in the loop head, the new state of `y` will be `y - 1`, assuming `y - 1` is still within the loop's range (i.e., `y - 1` is greater than or equal to `1`).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 1 element, `results` is an empty list, `max_sum` is the maximum value between the original `max_sum` and `current_sum`, `best_y` is `y` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `x` is at least 2, `y` is `y - 1`**.
