Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for x in test_cases:
    max_sum = 0
    best_y = 1
    for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
        gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
        current_sum = gcd_val + y
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            best_y = y
            break
    results.append(best_y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 1 element, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd_val + y` found for the last `x` in `test_cases`, `best_y` is the `y` that gave the maximum `current_sum` for the last `x` in `test_cases`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases` with an additional `1` appended, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases` with an additional `1` appended and one more `best_y` appended, `max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd(x, y) + y` found during the loop, `best_y` is the `y` that provided this maximum sum for the last `x` processed, `x` is the last element in `test_cases`, and `y` is the value that provided the maximum sum for the last `x` processed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
