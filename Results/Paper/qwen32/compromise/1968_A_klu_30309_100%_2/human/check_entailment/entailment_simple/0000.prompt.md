Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

    7
    
    10
    
    7
    
    21
    
    100
    
    2
    
    1000
    
    6

Output

    6
    18
    98

# Annotated Program:

t = int(input())
test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and test_cases is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        
        best_y = 1
        
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
                break
        
        results.append(best_y)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases`, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1.
    return results
    #The program returns `results`, which is a list containing the `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases`.
