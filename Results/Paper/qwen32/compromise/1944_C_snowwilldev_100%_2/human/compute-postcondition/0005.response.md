The code provided initializes a variable `t` to `0`. This does not affect the values of `N`, `a`, or `cnt`. The output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`N` is an integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of `N` integers (0 ≤ `a_i` < `N`), `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer value `0` and contains the frequency of each integer in the list `a`, `t` is 0.**
