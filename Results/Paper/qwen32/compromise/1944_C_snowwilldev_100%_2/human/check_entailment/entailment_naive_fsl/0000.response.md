Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob to achieve the game's score as defined by the MEX of the array `c`. The program incorrectly assumes that the game's score is determined by the first index `i` where the count of `i` in `a` is either 1 or 0, which does not align with the strategic interaction between Alice and Bob.

Let's analyze the program's logic and identify a potential issue:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the array `a` itself.
2. It counts the occurrences of each number in `a` using a dictionary `cnt`.
3. It then iterates through the possible values from 0 to N, checking if the count of the current value is 1 or 0. If so, it returns the current value as the MEX.

However, the program does not account for the strategic moves of Alice and Bob:
- Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she should aim to include as many unique elements as possible in `c`.
- Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he should aim to prevent Alice from including unique elements.

The program's current logic does not simulate this strategic interaction. Instead, it simply finds the first number with a count of 1 or 0, which does not consider the optimal moves by both players.

Let's consider a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```

**Explanation of the Correct Output:**
- Alice can pick any number, say 0.
- Bob can pick any number, say 1.
- Alice can pick the next number, say 2.
- Bob can pick the next number, say 3.
- Alice can pick the last number, 4.
- The final array `c` is `[0, 2, 4]` (or any permutation), and the MEX is 1.

The program, however, would return 0 because the count of 0 is 1, which is incorrect based on the optimal play described.

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not simulate the strategic interaction between Alice and Bob correctly.
