### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the solution is correct:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice starts by selecting an element from `a`, appending it to `c`, and then removing it from `a`.
   - Bob then selects an element from `a` and removes it from `a`.
   - This continues until `a` is empty.
   - The score of the game is the MEX of the array `c` after all elements have been moved.
   - Alice aims to maximize the score, while Bob aims to minimize it.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.
   - Since Alice and Bob are playing optimally, Alice will try to maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to minimize it.
   - The final MEX will depend on the elements that are in `c` and their counts.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - For the MEX to be as large as possible, we need as many unique elements in `c` as possible.
   - If an element appears exactly once in the original array `a`, it will always be in `c` because Bob will always remove a different element.
   - If there are at least two elements that appear exactly once, the MEX will be the smallest of these two elements.
   - If there is only one element that appears exactly once, the MEX will be that element.
   - If no element appears exactly once, the MEX will be the smallest element that is not in `a`.

4. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The provided code uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.
   - It then iterates through the numbers from `0` to `N` (inclusive) and checks the counts.
   - If an element appears exactly once, it increments a counter `t`.
   - If `t` reaches 2 (indicating at least two unique elements that appear exactly once) or if an element does not appear at all, it returns that element as the MEX.

5. **Verification:**
   - The code correctly identifies the smallest element that either does not appear in `a` or appears exactly once and ensures that if there are at least two such elements, it returns the smaller one.
   - This aligns with the optimal strategy for both players.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends, considering the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.

**Correctness: True**
