To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its effect on the variables:

The code snippet provided is:
```python
nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
```

Here’s what this line does:
- It converts the integer `arr[i - 1]` to a string.
- It then iterates over each character in the string representation of `arr[i - 1]`, converting each character back to an integer, and creates a list from these integers.
- It appends `arr[i]` to this list.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3 (unchanged).
- `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50 (unchanged).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99 (unchanged).
- `m` must be at least 2 (unchanged).
- `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input (partially updated).
- `ans` is True (unchanged).
- `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]` (unchanged).

After executing the code snippet:
- A new list `nums` is created which contains the digits of `arr[i - 1]` as individual integers, followed by `arr[i]`.

Thus, the only new variable introduced is `nums`, and the existing variables remain unchanged except for the context of `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` being used to form `nums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `ans` is True, `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**
