The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a new list called `arr`. This operation does not affect the existing variables `t`, `n`, `a`, or `m`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99; `m` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input line split and converted to integers.**
