The code snippet creates a new list `nums` by concatenating two parts: a list of digits from the integer `arr[i - 1]` (converted to a string and then each character back to an integer), and the integer `arr[i]`.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `arr[i - 1]` is an integer.
- `arr[i]` is an integer.

Let's denote:
- `arr[i - 1]` as `x`.
- `arr[i]` as `y`.

So, `nums` will be `[int(digit) for digit in str(x)] + [y]`.

For example, if `arr[i - 1]` is 123 and `arr[i]` is 45, then `nums` will be `[1, 2, 3, 45]`.

Since the exact values of `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]` are not specified, we can only describe the transformation in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99; `m` is an input integer and must be at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input line split and converted to integers; `ans` is True; `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]; `nums` is a list formed by concatenating the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the integer `arr[i]`.**
