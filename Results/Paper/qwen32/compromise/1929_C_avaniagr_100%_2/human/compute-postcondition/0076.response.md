Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained by splitting and converting the string `s` from the next line of input. If `x < k - 1`, then if `x == k - 1`, the condition `a >= x + 2` holds; otherwise, if `x != k - 1`, then `x > k - 3` and `z` is the value obtained by applying the loop's update rule `x - k + 3` times starting from `z = k - 2`; `i` is `x - k + 2`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a` remains as it is; otherwise, `a` is less than `z`. If `x < k - 1` does not hold, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, `a` remains as it is; otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 1`. The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged in both cases.**
