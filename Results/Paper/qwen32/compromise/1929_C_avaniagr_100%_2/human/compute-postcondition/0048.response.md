The `print('YES')` statement will execute and print the string `'YES'`. The initial state and the calculations for `z` do not affect the output of this specific print statement. The value of `z` is determined by a formula and multiple iterations, but the `print` statement is independent of these calculations and simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
