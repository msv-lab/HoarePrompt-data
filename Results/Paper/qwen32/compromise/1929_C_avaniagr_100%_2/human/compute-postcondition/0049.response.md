Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 1000 \), `k` and `x` are integers such that \( x > k - 3 \), `a` is an integer, and `z` is the result of applying the formula \( z_{i+1} = z_i + \left\lfloor \frac{z_i}{k-1} \right\rfloor + 1 \) for `x - k + 3` iterations starting from `z = k - 1` if `k != 2`, or `z = 1` if `k = 2`. Additionally, `a` is less than `z`.**
