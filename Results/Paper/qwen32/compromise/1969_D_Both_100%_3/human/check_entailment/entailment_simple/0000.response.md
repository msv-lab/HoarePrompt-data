### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program and verify whether it correctly computes Alice's optimal profit.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of items (`n`) and the number of items Bob can take for free (`k`).
   - It then reads the prices for Alice (`prices`) and the prices for Bob (`bonuses`).

2. **Negating Prices:**
   - The program negates the prices for Alice (`neg_prices`). This is done to use a min-heap (which pops the smallest element) to simulate a max-heap (which would pop the largest element).

3. **Sorting Items:**
   - The program pairs the negated prices and bonuses together into a list called `combined`.
   - It sorts `combined` based on the bonuses. This sorting ensures that items with higher bonuses are considered first, which aligns with Alice's goal of maximizing her profit.

4. **Initial Heap Population:**
   - The program pushes the first `k` items (sorted by bonus) into a min-heap (`heap`). These are the items Bob will take for free if Alice buys more than `k` items.

5. **Calculating Initial Profit:**
   - If there are any items left after pushing `k` items into the heap, the program calculates the initial profit using `func_3`. This function sums up the prices Alice pays for the items in the heap and adds the bonuses Bob pays for the remaining items.

6. **Updating Profit:**
   - The program iterates through the remaining items in `combined`.
   - For each item, it updates the current profit by adjusting for the bonus and the price of the item.
   - It then pushes the item into the heap and pops the smallest item from the heap (which represents the least profitable item for Alice to keep).
   - If the new profit is greater than the maximum profit encountered so far, it updates the maximum profit.

7. **Output:**
   - After processing all items for a test case, the program prints the maximum profit.

### Verification Against Example Test Cases:

Let's verify the program against the example test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - `n = 2`, `k = 0`
   - `prices = [2, 1]`, `bonuses = [1, 2]`
   - Since `k = 0`, Bob takes all items for free if Alice buys less than `k` items. Alice should buy the second item and sell it to Bob.
   - Profit: `2 - 1 = 1`

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - `n = 4`, `k = 1`
   - `prices = [1, 2, 1, 4]`, `bonuses = [3, 3, 2, 3]`
   - Alice should buy the first three items. Bob takes the first item for free and pays for the second and third items.
   - Profit: `(3 + 2) - (1 + 2 + 1) = 1`

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - `n = 4`, `k = 2`
   - `prices = [2, 1, 1, 1]`, `bonuses = [4, 2, 3, 2]`
   - Alice should buy all items. Bob takes the first two items for free and pays for the third and fourth items.
   - Profit: `(3 + 2) - (2 + 1 + 1 + 1) = 0`

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - `n = 6`, `k = 2`
   - `prices = [1, 3, 4, 9, 1, 3]`, `bonuses = [7, 6, 8, 10, 6, 8]`
   - Alice should buy all items. Bob takes the first two items for free and pays for the remaining items.
   - Profit: `(8 + 10 + 6 + 8) - (1 + 3 + 4 + 9 + 1 + 3) = 7`

The program correctly computes the maximum profit for each test case based on the described logic.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
