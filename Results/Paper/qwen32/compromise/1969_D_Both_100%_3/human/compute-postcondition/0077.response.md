Postcondition: **`heap` is an empty list, `combined` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is greater than 0, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice (where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`), `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `test_cases` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration**
