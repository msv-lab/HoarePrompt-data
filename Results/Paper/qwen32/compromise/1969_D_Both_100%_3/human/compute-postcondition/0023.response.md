Postcondition: **`heap` contains the last `k` tuples from the original `combined` list or all tuples if `combined` had fewer than `k` tuples; `combined` is not empty; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `max_profit` is 0; `current_profit` is 0; `test_cases` must be greater than 0.**
