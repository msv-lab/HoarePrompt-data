The code `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())` removes the last tuple from the `combined` list and pushes it onto the `heap`. Since `combined` is sorted by `bonuses` values, the last tuple in `combined` (which was the first tuple before sorting) will now be the one pushed onto the `heap`.

Here's the updated state:
- `heap` now contains the last tuple from the `combined` list that was just popped.
- `combined` has one less tuple compared to its initial state.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial conditions, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`heap` contains the last tuple from the original `combined` list if `combined` was non-empty, now it contains the tuple that was the last in `combined` after popping; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()` and must be greater than 0; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `max_profit` is 0; `current_profit` is 0; `combined` is a list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` paired together, sorted by the `bonuses` values, and now has one less tuple if it was non-empty; `test_cases` must be greater than 0.**
