Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `combined` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice (where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`), `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is the profit after processing all items, `test_cases` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.`**

Explanation: The only change made by the code is that `max_profit` is set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
