Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `heap` is an empty list, `combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice (where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`), `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `test_cases` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.`
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(k):
    if combined:
        heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `heap` contains the last element of the original `combined` list if `combined` was not empty, otherwise `heap` remains an empty list. `combined` has one less element than before if it was not empty, otherwise it remains an empty list. `remaining_items` is an empty list. `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`. `k` is greater than 0. `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice. `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `max_profit` is 0. `current_profit` is 0. `test_cases` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `heap` contains the last element of the original `combined` list plus the newly popped element if `combined` was not empty, otherwise `heap` remains an empty list. `combined` has one less element than before if it was not empty, otherwise it remains an empty list. `remaining_items` is an empty list. `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`. `k` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1. `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice. `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `max_profit` is 0. `current_profit` is 0. `test_cases` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `heap` contains the last element of the original `combined` list plus the newly popped element from `combined` if `combined` was not empty, otherwise `heap` remains an empty list. `combined` has one less element than before if it was not empty, otherwise it remains an empty list. `remaining_items` is an empty list. `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`. `k` is greater than 0 (the value before it was decremented). `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice. `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `max_profit` is 0. `current_profit` is 0. `test_cases` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
