Postcondition: **`heap` contains `item` and the smallest element has been removed; `removed_item` holds the smallest element that was removed from the heap; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` is the initial value minus the number of iterations; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `combined` is not empty but has one less element; `item` is the last element that was popped from `combined`. If `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is decreased by the second element of `item`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is updated to its previous value plus `item[0]`.**
