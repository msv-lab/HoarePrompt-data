To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the condition `while combined:`. This loop will execute as long as `combined` is not empty.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `heap` contains the last `k` elements of the original `combined` list (or all elements if `combined` had fewer than `k` elements).
- If `combined` is not empty, it indicates that `combined` originally had fewer than `k` elements.
- `remaining_items` is an empty list.
- `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`.
- `k` is the initial value minus the number of iterations (which is `0` if all iterations were completed).
- `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`.
- `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice.
- `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`.
- `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`; otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.
- `current_profit` retains its value.
- `test_cases` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration in both cases.

For the `while` loop to execute at least once, `combined` must not be empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `combined` has at least one element.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Ensure that `combined` is not empty. We can set `combined` to a non-empty list, such as `[some_value]`.

No other states need to be adjusted because the condition `while combined:` only depends on the `combined` variable.

### Final State:
State: **`heap` contains the last `k` elements of the original `combined` list (or all elements if `combined` had fewer than `k` elements), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is the initial value minus the number of iterations (which is `0` if all iterations were completed), `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`; otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged, `current_profit` retains its value, `test_cases` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration in both cases, and `combined` is `[some_value]`**.

Since the specific values of the elements in `combined` do not matter for the loop to start executing, we can use a placeholder like `[some_value]` to indicate that `combined` is not empty.
