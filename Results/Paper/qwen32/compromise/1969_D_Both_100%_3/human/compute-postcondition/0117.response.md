The only variable in the loop head is `combined`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `combined`. If `combined` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `combined` is not empty but has one less element. For the loop to execute one more time, `combined` must still contain at least one element.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state so that `combined` is not empty.

State: **`heap` contains all the original elements except the smallest one, plus `item`; `removed_item` holds the smallest element that was just popped from the heap; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` is the initial value minus the number of iterations; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `combined` is not empty; `item` is the last element that was popped from `combined`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. If `removed_item` is truthy, `current_profit` is decreased by the first element of `removed_item`.**
