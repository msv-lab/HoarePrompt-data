Postcondition: **`heap` contains the last `k` elements of the original `combined` list (or all elements if `combined` had fewer than `k` elements). If `combined` is not empty, it indicates that `combined` originally had fewer than `k` elements, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is the initial value minus the number of iterations (which is `0` if all iterations were completed), `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`; otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged. `current_profit` retains its value. `test_cases` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration in both cases.**
