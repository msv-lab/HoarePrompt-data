The code snippet `current_profit += item[0]` increments the value of `current_profit` by the first element of the `item` tuple.

Given the initial state:
- `heap` contains the last `k` elements that were in `combined` (or all elements of `combined` if `combined` had fewer than `k` elements).
- `combined` is either empty or contains the original elements minus the last one.
- `item` holds the value of the last element that was in `combined`.
- `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `test_cases`, `remaining_items` remain unchanged.
- If `combined` is not empty, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`.
- `item[0] + item[1]` is less than 0.

After executing `current_profit += item[0]`, the value of `current_profit` changes. All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`heap` contains the last `k` elements that were in `combined` (or all elements of `combined` if `combined` had fewer than `k` elements); `combined` is either empty or contains the original elements minus the last one; `item` holds the value of the last element that was in `combined`; `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `test_cases`, `remaining_items` remain unchanged; if `combined` is not empty, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` plus `item[0]`.**
