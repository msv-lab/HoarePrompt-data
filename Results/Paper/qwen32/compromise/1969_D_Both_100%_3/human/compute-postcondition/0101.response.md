Postcondition: **`heap` contains `item` and the smallest element has been removed; `removed_item` holds the smallest element that was removed from the heap, which is truthy; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is the initial value minus the number of iterations, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`; otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged, `test_cases` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `combined` is an empty list, `item` is `some_value`. If the sum of the first two elements of `item` is non-negative, `current_profit` is reduced by `item[1]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]`.**
