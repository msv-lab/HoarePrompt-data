Postcondition: **`heap` contains `item` and the smallest element has been removed; `removed_item` holds the smallest element that was removed from the heap; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` is the initial value minus the number of iterations; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`; otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged; `test_cases` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `combined` is an empty list; `item` is `some_value`. If `removed_item` is truthy, `current_profit` is reduced by `removed_item[0]`.**
