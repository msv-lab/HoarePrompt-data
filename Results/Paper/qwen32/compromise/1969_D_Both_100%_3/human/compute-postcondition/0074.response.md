The code snippet combines the `neg_prices` and `bonuses` lists into a single list of tuples using the `zip` function. This means that each element in `combined` will be a tuple containing the corresponding elements from `neg_prices` and `bonuses`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `combined`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains corresponding elements from `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice (where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`), `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `test_cases` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.`**

In simpler terms: `combined` now holds pairs of negative prices and their corresponding bonuses, while all other variables retain their original values.
