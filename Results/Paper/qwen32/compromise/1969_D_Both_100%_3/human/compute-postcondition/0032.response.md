The given code snippet subtracts the second element of the `item` tuple from `current_profit`. Based on the initial state provided, the only variable that changes is `current_profit`.

Here's the updated state:

- `heap` still contains the last `k` tuples from the original `combined` list or all tuples if `combined` had fewer than `k` tuples.
- `combined` is not empty but has one less element than before.
- `remaining_items` is still an empty list.
- `n` is still the first value returned by `func_2()`.
- `k` is still the second value returned by `func_2()`.
- `prices` is still the list returned by `func_2()`.
- `neg_prices` is still a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`.
- `bonuses` is still the list returned by `func_2()`.
- `max_profit` is still equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged.
- `current_profit` is now `current_profit - item[1]`.
- `test_cases` must still be greater than 0.
- `item` is still the last tuple that was removed from `combined` and satisfies the condition that the sum of its first and second elements is non-negative.

Output State: **`heap` contains the last `k` tuples from the original `combined` list or all tuples if `combined` had fewer than `k` tuples; `combined` is not empty but has one less element than before; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged; `current_profit` is `current_profit - item[1]`; `test_cases` must be greater than 0; `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined` and satisfies the condition that the sum of its first and second elements is non-negative.**
