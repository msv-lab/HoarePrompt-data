Postcondition: **`item` is the last element that was in `combined`; `combined` is missing its last element; `heap` includes `item` and the smallest item is now `removed_item`; `removed_item` is the smallest item in the heap after pushing `item`; `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `test_cases`, `remaining_items` remain unchanged; `current_profit` is adjusted based on the value of `item[0] + item[1]` and further decreased by `removed_item[0]`. Specifically, if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is decreased by `item[1]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]`.**
