The given code snippet modifies the `current_profit` by adding the first element of the `item` tuple to it. 

Given the initial state, `item` is the last tuple removed from `combined` and the sum of its first two elements is less than 0. Since we only care about the first element of `item` for the calculation of `current_profit`, let's denote the first element of `item` as `item[0]`.

Therefore, `current_profit` is updated to its previous value plus `item[0]`.

Output State: **`heap` contains the last `k` tuples from the original `combined` list or all tuples if `combined` had fewer than `k` tuples; `combined` is not empty but has one less element than before; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged; `current_profit` is the previous `current_profit` plus `item[0]`; `test_cases` must be greater than 0; `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined` and the sum of the first two elements of `item` is less than 0.**
