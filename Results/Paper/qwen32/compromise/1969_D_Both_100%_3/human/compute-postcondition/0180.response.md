Postcondition: **`heap` contains the last `k` elements of `combined` (excluding the smallest element and the popped item) plus `item`, excluding the smallest element among them; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before `item` was added; `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `test_cases`, `remaining_items`, and `current_profit` remain unchanged. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit`. If `removed_item` is not None, `current_profit` is decreased by the value of `removed_item[0]`.**
