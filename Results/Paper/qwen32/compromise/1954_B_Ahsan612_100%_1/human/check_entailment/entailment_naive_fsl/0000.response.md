Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful is flawed. Let's analyze the code and identify a potential issue.

The code attempts to find the smallest contiguous segment of identical elements and removes that segment. However, this strategy does not guarantee that the resulting array will stop being beautiful. The issue arises when there are multiple segments of different lengths, and removing the smallest segment does not necessarily prevent the array from being beautiful.

Consider the following test case:

```
1
7
3 3 3 5 5 5 5
```

The program will identify the segment `3 3 3` and `5 5 5 5` and will consider the smallest segment `3 3 3` with a length of 3. It will then output 3, suggesting that removing 3 elements will make the array stop being beautiful. However, removing the segment `3 3 3` will result in the array `5 5 5 5`, which is still beautiful.

A correct approach would involve checking if the array can be partitioned into segments such that removing any segment will result in an array that is not beautiful. The current implementation does not handle this correctly.

Thus, the code is incorrect for at least this test case.
