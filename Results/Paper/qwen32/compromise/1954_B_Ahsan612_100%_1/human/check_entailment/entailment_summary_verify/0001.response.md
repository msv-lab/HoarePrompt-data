### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the program is correct based on the problem description and the given function summary.

#### Problem Recap:
The goal is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a "beautiful" array so that it stops being beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly choosing an index `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1`), such that `a[i-1] = a[i+1]`, and replacing `a[i]` with `a[i-1]`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads `t` (number of test cases).
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the array) and the array `ar` itself.

2. **Logic**:
   - The variable `same` is initialized to 1. This variable counts the length of the current sequence of identical elements.
   - The variable `num` is initialized to the first element of the array. It keeps track of the current sequence's element.
   - The variable `minn` is initialized to `inf` (infinity). This variable will store the minimum length of any sequence of identical elements found in the array.
   - The program iterates through the array starting from the second element.
     - If the current element is the same as `num`, it increments `same`.
     - If the current element is different from `num`, it:
       - Updates `minn` with the minimum value between `minn` and `same`.
       - Resets `same` to 1.
       - Updates `num` to the current element.
   - After the loop, it performs a final update of `minn` with the minimum value between `minn` and `same` to account for the last sequence.
   - If `minn` is still `inf` or if `minn` is equal to the length of the array (`len(ar)`), it means all elements in the array are the same, and it prints `-1` (impossible to make it non-beautiful).
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`, which is the minimum number of elements to remove.

#### Function Summary:
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines the minimum length of a sequence of consecutive identical numbers in the list `a`. If such a sequence exists, it prints the length; otherwise, it prints -1.

#### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies the minimum length of any sequence of identical elements in the array.
- However, the key issue is that the problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The program only considers the minimum length of sequences of identical elements, which is not sufficient for solving the problem.
- The program does not account for the possibility of breaking the array into multiple sequences that cannot be reduced to a single value through the described operation.

#### Example Analysis:
Let's consider the example provided in the problem description:
- **Test Case 4**: `7`, `3 3 3 5 3 3 3`
  - The program identifies the minimum length of a sequence of identical elements as `1` (for the element `5`).
  - However, the correct answer is `3`, as removing the first three `3`s results in the array `[5, 3, 3, 3]`, which is not beautiful.

#### Conclusion:
The program is not correct because it does not accurately determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It only considers the minimum length of sequences of identical elements, which is not sufficient for solving the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
