Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect. The logic to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful is flawed. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that the minimum run of consecutive identical numbers represents the minimum number of elements to remove. This is not necessarily true because the operation described allows for more complex manipulations of the array.

Consider the following counterexample:
```
Input:
1
7
1 2 2 1 2 2 1

Output:
Expected: 2
Actual: 1
```
In this case, the program would incorrectly identify the minimum run of consecutive identical numbers as 1 (for the '1's at the beginning and end), and thus output 1. However, to make the array stop being beautiful, you need to remove at least two elements (either the two '2's in the middle or the two '1's at the ends and one '2').

The correct approach should involve a more sophisticated analysis of the array to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the "beauty" condition.
