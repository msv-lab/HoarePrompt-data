To determine the output state after the loop has finished all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables `i`, `num`, `same`, and `minn` evolve as the loop progresses.

Starting from the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (remains unchanged throughout the loop).
- `n` is an input integer (remains unchanged throughout the loop).
- `ar` is a list of integers.
- `same` is initialized to 1.
- `num` is initialized to `ar[0]`.
- `minn` is initialized to `inf`.
- `i` is initialized to 1.

The loop runs until `i` is no longer less than the length of `ar`. Here's what happens in each iteration:
- If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, `same` is incremented by 1.
- If `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, `i` is incremented by 1, `num` is updated to `ar[i]`, `minn` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `same`, and `same` is reset to 1.
- Regardless of the condition, `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

The loop will terminate when `i` equals the length of `ar`. At this point, we need to consider the final state of the variables:
- `i` will be equal to the length of `ar`.
- `num` will be the last unique number encountered in the list.
- `same` will be the count of the last sequence of identical numbers.
- `minn` will be the minimum count of any sequence of identical numbers found in the list.

Thus, the final output state of the loop is:
Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `num` is the last unique number in `ar`, `same` is the count of the last sequence of identical numbers, and `minn` is the minimum count of any sequence of identical numbers in `ar`.**

In simpler terms, the loop finishes when `i` reaches the end of the list `ar`, and the final state reflects the last unique number encountered (`num`), the count of that last sequence (`same`), and the smallest count of any sequence of identical numbers found in the list (`minn`).
