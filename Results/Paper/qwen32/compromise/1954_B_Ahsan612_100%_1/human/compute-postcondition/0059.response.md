The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` was previously 2 or 3, it will now be 3 or 4, respectively. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers with at least 4 elements, if `ar[i]` was equal to `num`, then `i` is now 3, `same` is 2, and `minn` is `inf`. Otherwise, `i` is now 4, `num` is `ar[2]`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is 1.**
