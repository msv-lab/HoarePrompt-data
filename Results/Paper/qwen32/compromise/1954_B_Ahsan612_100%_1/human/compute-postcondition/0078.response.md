To determine what will be printed by the given `print(minn)` statement, let's break down the provided initial state and deduce the value of `minn`.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t` is greater than 0**: This is a condition that `t` must satisfy, but it does not directly affect the value of `minn`.
2. **`n` is an input integer**: This is the input integer provided to the program, but its exact value is not specified.
3. **`ar` is a new list of integers**: This is a list of integers, but its contents are not specified.
4. **`i` is the length of `ar`**: `i` is the number of elements in the list `ar`.
5. **`num` is the last unique element in a sequence**: This variable holds the last unique element encountered in the sequence, but its exact value is not specified.
6. **`same` is the count of the last sequence of identical elements**: This variable holds the count of consecutive identical elements in the sequence, but its exact value is not specified.
7. **`minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`**: This variable holds the minimum value between its previous value and the value of `same`. It is neither equal to infinity nor equal to the length of `ar`.

### Deduction of `minn`:
From the given information, `minn` is a variable that keeps track of the minimum count of consecutive identical elements encountered so far. The exact value of `minn` cannot be determined without knowing the specific sequence of elements in `ar`. However, we do know that `minn` is not infinity and not equal to the length of `ar`.

### Output:
Given the initial state, the `print(minn)` statement will print the current value of `minn`, which is the minimum count of consecutive identical elements encountered in the sequence.

Output: **minn (where minn is the minimum count of consecutive identical elements encountered in the sequence)**
