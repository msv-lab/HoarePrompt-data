The code snippet `num = ar[i]` updates the value of `num` to be the element at index `i` in the list `ar`. Given the initial state, `i` is either 3 or 4, so `num` will be updated to either `ar[3]` or `ar[4]`.

Here is the output state:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `i` is either 3 or 4, `num` is `ar[i]`, `same` is 2 if `ar[i-1]` equals `ar[i]` (i.e., `ar[2]` equals `ar[3]` if `i` was 3 and `ar[3]` equals `ar[4]` if `i` was 4), otherwise `same` is 1, and `minn` is `inf` if `same` is 2, otherwise `minn` is 1.**

In natural language: The value of `num` has been updated to `ar[i]`, where `i` is either 3 or 4. The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `same` is recalculated based on whether `ar[i-1]` equals `ar[i]`, and `minn` is set to `inf` if `same` is 2, otherwise `minn` is 1.
