Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 5 elements. If `ar[4]` equals `num`, then `i` remains 4, `num` remains either `ar[2]` or `ar[3]`, `minn` is either 1 or the minimum of 1 and `ar[3]`, and `same` is either 2 or increased by 1. Otherwise, `i` becomes 5, `num` becomes `ar[5]`, `minn` is updated to the minimum of its initial value and `same`, and `same` is reset to 1.**
