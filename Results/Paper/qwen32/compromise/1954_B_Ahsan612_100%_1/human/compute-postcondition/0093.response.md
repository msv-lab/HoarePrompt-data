The code `minn = min(minn, same)` compares the current value of `minn` with `same` and assigns the smaller value to `minn`. Given that `minn` is initially `inf` (infinity) and `same` is `1`, `minn` will be updated to `1`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `num` is `ar[2]`, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1**
