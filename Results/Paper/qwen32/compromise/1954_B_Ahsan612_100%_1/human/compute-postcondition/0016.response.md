The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given the initial conditions, if `ar[i]` initially equals `num`, `i` was 1 and will now be 2. If `ar[i]` did not equal `num`, `i` was 2 and will now be 3. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, `minn`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. If `ar[i]` equals `num`, `same` is 2, `num` remains `ar[0]`, `minn` remains `inf`, and `i` is 2. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is updated to `ar[2]`, `minn` is updated to 1, and `i` is 3.**
