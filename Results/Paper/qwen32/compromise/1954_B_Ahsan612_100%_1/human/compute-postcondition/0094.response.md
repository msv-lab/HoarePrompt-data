The code snippet provided simply reassigns the value `1` to the variable `same`, which already holds the value `1`. Therefore, the value of `same` remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `num` is `ar[2]`, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1**.
