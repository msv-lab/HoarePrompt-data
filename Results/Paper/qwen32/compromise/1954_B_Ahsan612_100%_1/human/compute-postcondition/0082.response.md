The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual string elements, converts each of these elements to an integer, and then assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `ar`. This operation changes the value of `ar` from a new list of integers to the list of integers provided by the input.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `num`, `same`, `minn`) are not directly affected by this code snippet and retain their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input, `i` is the length of `ar`, `num` is the last unique element in a sequence, `same` is the count of the last sequence of identical elements, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`. If `minn` is either `inf` or equal to the length of `ar`, then `minn` retains its value as `inf` or the length of `ar`. Otherwise, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`.**
