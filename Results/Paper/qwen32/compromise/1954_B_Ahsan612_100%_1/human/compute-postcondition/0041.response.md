The code snippet `n = int(input())` changes the value of `n` to an integer input by the user. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `num` is the last unique number in `ar`, `same` is the count of the last sequence of identical numbers, and `minn` is the minimum of its current value and `same`. If `minn` is either equal to infinity or equal to the length of `ar`, then `minn` retains that value. Otherwise, `minn` is neither equal to infinity nor equal to the length of `ar`.**
