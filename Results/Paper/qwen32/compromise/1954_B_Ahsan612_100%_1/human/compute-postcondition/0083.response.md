Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input, `i` is the length of `ar`, `num` is the last unique element in a sequence, `same` is 1, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and 1. If `minn` is either `inf` or equal to the length of `ar`, then `minn` retains its value as `inf` or the length of `ar`. Otherwise, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and 1.**

In simple terms: The value of `same` has been set to 1. The value of `minn` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and 1, while other variables remain unchanged.
