The value of `num` is updated to be the first element of the list `ar`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers provided by the user input, `i` is equal to the length of the new `ar`, `num` is `ar[0]`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is the minimum of its current value and 1. If `minn` is either equal to infinity or equal to the length of `ar`, then `minn` retains that value. Otherwise, `minn` is the minimum of its current value and 1.**
