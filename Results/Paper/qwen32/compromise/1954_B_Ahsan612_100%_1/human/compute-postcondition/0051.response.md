The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `i` is 2. All other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `same`, and `minn` are still valid.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `num` is `ar[0]`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is `inf`. Additionally, `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.**
