The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` is 2, so after the increment, `i` becomes 3. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, and `minn`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `num` is updated to `ar[2]`, `minn` is updated to 1, and `i` is 3.
