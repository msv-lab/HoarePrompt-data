The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `same`, `minn`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `num` is `ar[0]`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is `inf`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `num` is `ar[0]`, `same` is 1, `minn` is `inf`**.
