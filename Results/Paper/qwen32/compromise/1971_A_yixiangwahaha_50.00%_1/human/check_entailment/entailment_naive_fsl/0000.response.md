Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the number of test cases specified by the input. The program assumes there will always be exactly 10 test cases, which is incorrect according to the problem description that states the number of test cases can be between 1 and 100 inclusive. 

Here is a potential case where the program does not work as expected:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  1 9
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  1 9
  ```
- Actual Output: The program will attempt to read 10 test cases and will likely throw an error or produce incorrect results because it only received 1 test case.

To fix the program, it should read the number of test cases `t` and then iterate `t` times instead of a fixed 10 times. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        print(min(x, y), max(x, y))

func()
```
