### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided Python program to see if it correctly solves the problem of determining the minimum number of screens required to place the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons.

#### Problem Recap:
- Each screen is a 5x3 grid.
- We need to place `x` 1x1 icons and `y` 2x2 icons on the minimum number of such screens.
- A 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells.
- A 1x1 icon takes up 1 cell.
- Each cell can hold only one icon.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Handling 2x2 Icons**:
    - Each 2x2 icon requires 4 cells.
    - A 5x3 grid can hold at most 1 2x2 icon in a way that maximizes space usage. Placing a 2x2 icon leaves 11 cells available for 1x1 icons.
    - The optimal strategy is to place as many 2x2 icons as possible first, then fill the remaining space with 1x1 icons.

2. **Handling 1x1 Icons**:
    - After placing the 2x2 icons, the remaining space can be filled with 1x1 icons.
    - Each screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons (since 15 cells remain after placing a 2x2 icon).
    - If no 2x2 icons are placed, the screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
- **func_1(a, b)**:
    - This function returns the smaller of the two integers `a` and `b`.
    - It is not used anywhere in the provided code, so it does not contribute to solving the problem.

- **func_2()**:
    - This function reads input values `x` and `y`.
    - It calculates the number of screens required based on the presence of 2x2 and 1x1 icons.
    - The logic used in this function is as follows:
        - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
            - `bxsfory` is calculated as the ceiling of `y / 2`. This is the minimum number of screens required to place `y` 2x2 icons, as each screen can hold at most 1 2x2 icon.
            - `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. This step seems incorrect because it's adjusting `x` in a way that doesn't make sense in the context of filling the remaining cells. The correct approach would be to calculate the remaining cells after placing `bxsfory` 2x2 icons and then determine how many additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
            - `bxsfory1` is calculated as `0` if `x <= 0` else `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`. This step is also incorrect because it adds 1 extra screen unconditionally, which is not necessary.
            - The final result is printed as `bxsfory1 + bxsfory`.
        - If `x == 0` and `y > 0`:
            - The result is `math.ceil(y / 2)`, which is correct as each screen can hold at most 1 2x2 icon.
        - If `x > 0` and `y == 0`:
            - The result is `math.ceil(x / 15)`, which is correct as each screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons.
        - If `x == 0` and `y == 0`:
            - The result is `0`, which is correct as no icons are needed.

- **func_3()**:
    - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_2()` for each test case. This part is correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided code contains logical errors in the calculation of the number of screens required when both `x` and `y` are greater than 0. The logic for adjusting `x` and calculating `bxsfory1` is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
