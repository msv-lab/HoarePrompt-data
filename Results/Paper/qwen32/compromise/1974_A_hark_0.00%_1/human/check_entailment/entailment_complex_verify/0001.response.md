### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the logic of the program, particularly focusing on the case where both `x > 0` and `y > 0`.

#### Key Points:
1. **2x2 Icons**: Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
2. **1x1 Icons**: Each 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.
3. **Screen Capacity**: Each screen can hold a maximum of 15 cells.

#### Strategy:
1. **Maximize 2x2 Icon Placement**: Place as many 2x2 icons as possible first since they occupy more space.
2. **Remaining 1x1 Icons**: After placing the 2x2 icons, place the remaining 1x1 icons.
3. **Calculate Screens Needed**: Calculate the number of screens needed based on the remaining cells required for 1x1 icons.

### Analysis of `func_2()`:

1. **Case 1: Both `x > 0` and `y > 0`**:
   - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`: This calculates the number of screens needed for `y` 2x2 icons. Since each screen can fit at most 2 2x2 icons (taking up 8 cells each), we need `ceil(y / 2)` screens for 2x2 icons.
   - `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`: This line is incorrect. It seems to be trying to adjust the number of 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons, but the logic is flawed. It should calculate the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons.
     - **Correct Calculation**: The correct approach is to calculate the remaining cells after placing `bxsfory` screens of 2x2 icons. Each screen with 2x2 icons uses 8 cells, and if a screen has only one 2x2 icon, it uses 4 cells. We need to calculate the remaining cells accurately.
   - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`: This line is also incorrect. It should calculate the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons, but the logic is flawed.
     - **Correct Calculation**: If `x` is the remaining number of 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons, we need `math.ceil(x / 15)` screens for these 1x1 icons.
   - `print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)`: This line prints the total number of screens, but due to the incorrect logic in the previous steps, it will not produce the correct result.

### Correct Approach for Case 1:

1. Calculate the number of screens needed for `y` 2x2 icons:
   - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`
2. Calculate the total cells occupied by these 2x2 icons:
   - `cells_occupied_by_2x2 = bxsfory * 4 * 2` (if `bxsfory` screens are fully occupied by 2x2 icons) or `cells_occupied_by_2x2 = bxsfory * 4` (if `bxsfory` screens are not fully occupied).
3. Calculate the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons:
   - `remaining_cells = bxsfory * 15 - cells_occupied_by_2x2`
4. Calculate the remaining 1x1 icons that need to be placed:
   - `remaining_1x1 = x - (bxsfory * 4 * 2)` (if `bxsfory` screens are fully occupied) or `remaining_1x1 = x - (bxsfory * 4)` (if `bxsfory` screens are not fully occupied).
5. Calculate the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons:
   - `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(remaining_1x1 / 15)`
6. Total screens needed:
   - `total_screens = bxsfory + bxsfory1`

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is correct in identifying the flaws in the logic for the case where both `x > 0` and `y > 0`. The program does not correctly handle the placement of 2x2 and 1x1 icons and the calculation of the remaining cells and screens.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
