Postcondition: **`x` and `y` are integers with initial values in the range 0 to 99. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, then `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` where `bxsfory` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`. If either `x` or `y` is 0 (or both are 0), the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the conditions specified in the if part hold.**

This postcondition summarizes the behavior of the if-else block, detailing how `x` and `y` change based on the conditions provided.
