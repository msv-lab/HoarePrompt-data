In the given initial state, the variables `s`, `n`, and `x` are defined, but the print statement `print('NO')` does not depend on any of these variables. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Let's break down the provided information:
- `s` is the input string.
- `n` is the length of the input string.
- `x` is -1, and its current value is also -1.

Since the `print` statement is hardcoded to print `'NO'`, the values of `s`, `n`, and `x` do not influence the output of the print statement.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **NO**
