The given initial state provides several conditions and definitions about the variables and objects involved, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the specific values or conditions of the variables `s`, `n`, `x`, or the result of `func_1(s[x + 1:])`.

Here is the breakdown:

- `s` is an input string.
- `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
- `x` is not equal to -1.
- `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`.
- `x` is either `1` or `x` is equal to `n // 2`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'`. None of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
