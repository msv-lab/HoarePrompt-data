To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to analyze the variables and their values based on the provided initial state:

1. `s` is the input string.
2. `n` is the length of the input string `s`. However, `n` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
3. `x` is not equal to -1, meaning `x` is a valid index in the string `s`.
4. `func_1(s[x + 1:])` evaluates to `False`. This tells us something about the substring starting from `x + 1` to the end of the string, but it doesn't affect the direct output of the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
```

This statement prints two parts of the string `s` separated by a space:
- `s[:x + 1]`: This is the substring from the beginning of the string `s` up to and including the character at index `x`.
- `s[x + 1:]`: This is the substring from the character at index `x + 1` to the end of the string `s`.

Given that `x` is a valid index and not equal to -1, we can describe the output as follows:

- The first part of the output is the substring from the start of `s` up to and including the character at index `x`.
- The second part of the output is the substring from the character at index `x + 1` to the end of `s`.

Since we do not have the exact value of `s` or `x`, we describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **s[:x + 1] s[x + 1:] (where s[:x + 1] is the substring from the start of s up to and including the character at index x, and s[x + 1:] is the substring from the character at index x + 1 to the end of s)**
