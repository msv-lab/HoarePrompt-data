Output State: **The program returns a list `ans` of `n` integers where each element `ans[i]` is calculated as `1000000000 - sum(arr[i:n-1])` for `i` from 0 to `n-2`, and `ans[n-1]` is `1000000000`.**

In simpler terms, the program returns a list `ans` where each element except the last one is `1000000000` minus the sum of a slice of `arr` starting from the current index `i` to `n-2`, and the last element of `ans` is always `1000000000`.
