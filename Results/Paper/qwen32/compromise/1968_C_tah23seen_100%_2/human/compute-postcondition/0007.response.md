Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500; `n` must be at least 4; `ans` is a list of `n` integers, each equal to 1000000000 except `ans[i]` which is `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` and `ans[i + 1]` which is `1000000000 - arr[i + 1]`; `i` is `n - 3`.**

Natural language description: The value of `ans[i]` is updated to be equal to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`. The value of `ans[i + 1]` remains `1000000000 - arr[i + 1]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
