Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of \(n\). The strategy used in the program is flawed and does not cover all cases optimally.

Let's break down the issues:
1. For \(n = 2\), the program correctly outputs two points, (1, 1) and (1, 2), which results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\).
2. For \(n = 3\), the program outputs (1, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 3). This results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which is correct.
3. For \(n \geq 4\), the program outputs (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4), and then points of the form (j, j) for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\). This strategy does not maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances.

To maximize the set \(\mathcal{H}\), a more optimal strategy is needed, such as placing points in a way that maximizes the variety of distances. One such strategy is to place points along a diagonal and some points off the diagonal to create a wide range of Manhattan distances.

For example, for \(n = 4\), a better arrangement could be (1, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), and (4, 4), which results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\).

Therefore, the given program is incorrect for \(n \geq 4\).
