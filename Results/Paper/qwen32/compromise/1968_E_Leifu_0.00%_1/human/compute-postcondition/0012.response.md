To determine the output, let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50.
- `n` is an input integer such that `n` > 3.
- `j` is defined as `n` + 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `j`**: Since `j` is defined as `n + 1`, the value of `j` is one more than the value of `n`.
2. **Print Statement**: The `print` statement concatenates the string representation of `j` with a space and then the string representation of `j` again.

### Output:
The output will be the string representation of `j` followed by a space and then the string representation of `j` again.

Since `j` is `n + 1` and `n` is an integer greater than 3, `j` will be an integer greater than 4. However, without a specific value for `n`, we can only describe `j` in terms of `n`.

Output: **(n + 1) (n + 1) (where n is an integer greater than 3)**

However, since the problem asks for the most precise description possible based on the precondition, and we know `j` is explicitly `n + 1`, we can simplify the output description as:

Output: **j j (where j is n + 1 and n > 3)**
