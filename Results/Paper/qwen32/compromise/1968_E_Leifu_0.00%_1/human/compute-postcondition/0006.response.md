The `print` statement in the given code snippet outputs the string `'2 3'`. This string is explicitly provided in the `print` function and does not depend on the values of the variables `t` and `n` as defined in the initial state.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state provides information about variables `t` and `n`, but these are not used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'2 3'`.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **2 3**
