The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, and `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50; `n` is an input integer**
