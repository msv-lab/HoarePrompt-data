To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(c))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the roles of the variables involved:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.
- `n`, `m`, and `l` are unchanged throughout the process.
- `k` is reduced by the total `s` accumulated over all iterations.
- `s` is the value from the last iteration.
- `c` is the accumulated value after all iterations.

The key variable here is `c`, which is described as the accumulated value after all iterations. This implies that `c` is the result of some accumulation process that occurs over `t` iterations. Since the exact accumulation process isn't specified in the initial state, we can only describe `c` in terms of the accumulation that happens during these iterations.

Given this, the output of the `print(int(c))` statement will be the integer value of `c`, which is the final accumulated value after all iterations.

Output: **c (where c is the accumulated value after all iterations)**
