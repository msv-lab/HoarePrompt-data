Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `s` is 0; `c` is `k * k / 2`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    s = min(m, k)
    k -= s
    c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0; `m` and `k` are integers read from the input, with `k` being `k - s`; `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `s` is the smaller of `m` and `k`; `c` is \(\frac{k^2}{2} + l[i] \cdot s - \frac{s^2}{2}\).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than 0; `m` is unchanged; `k` is `k - 2s`; `l` is a sorted list of integers; `s` is the smaller of `m` and the original `k`; `c` is \(\frac{k^2}{2} + 2 \cdot (l[i] \cdot s) - s^2\); `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `k` is `k - s`, `c` is updated by adding `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` to its previous value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
