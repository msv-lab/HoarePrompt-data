The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. This means the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated based on the input, while other variables like `t`, `l`, `s`, and `c` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified later in the code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `s` is `min(m, k)` from the last iteration, `c` is updated to `k * k / 2 + Σ(l[i] * s - s * s / 2)` for all iterations, `i` is `n + 1`.**
