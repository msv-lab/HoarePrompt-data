Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `k - min(m, k)`, `l` is the newly read sorted list of integers from the input, `s` is min(m, k), `c` is `k * k / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, `i` is `n + 1`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `c` has been updated to include the term `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
