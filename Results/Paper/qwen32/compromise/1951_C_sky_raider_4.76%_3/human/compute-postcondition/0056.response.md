The value of `k` is decremented by `s`. Given that `s` is `min(m, k)`, the new value of `k` will be `k - min(m, k)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `k - min(m, k) - min(m, k) - min(m, k)`, `l` is the newly read sorted list of integers from the input, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `c` is `k * k / 2 + 2 * l[0] * s - s * s`, `i` is 1**.
