The code snippet assigns the value of `k * k / 2` to the variable `c`. This means `c` now holds the result of squaring `k` and then dividing by 2.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `c`, which is now calculated as `k * k / 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `k` is reduced by the total `s` accumulated over all iterations; `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input; `s` is 0; `c` is `k * k / 2`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
