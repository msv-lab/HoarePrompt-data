### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and compare it against the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements:
- We need to find the minimum cost to purchase exactly `k` tickets over `n` days.
- Each day, we can purchase up to `m` tickets.
- Purchasing `x` tickets on day `i` increases the price of tickets on all subsequent days by `x`.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `a` of ticket prices.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. This is a good strategy because buying cheaper tickets first minimizes the overall cost.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The variable `s` is initialized to `min(m, k)`. This represents the number of tickets to buy on the current day, which is the lesser of the maximum allowed (`m`) and the remaining tickets needed (`k`).
   - The variable `c` is initialized to `k * k / 2`. This part seems incorrect because it doesn't represent any meaningful initial cost.
   - The loop iterates over each day, updating `s` and `k` accordingly, and adds the cost of tickets bought on that day to `c`. However, the formula used to update `c` (`c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2`) is incorrect. The `- s * s / 2` term doesn't make sense in this context.

4. **Output**:
   - The final cost `c` is printed for each test case.

#### Issues Identified:
- The initialization of `c` to `k * k / 2` is incorrect and doesn't contribute to the correct calculation of the minimum cost.
- The formula used to update `c` includes an unnecessary term (`- s * s / 2`), which skews the result.
- The code does not correctly account for the price increase on subsequent days after purchasing tickets.

#### Correct Approach:
- Initialize `c` to 0.
- Iterate through the sorted list of prices, buying up to `m` tickets each day while decrementing `k` and adding the cost to `c`.
- Ensure that the price increase logic is correctly applied, although the provided code does not explicitly show this.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided code is incorrect. It does not accurately compute the minimum cost to purchase the required number of tickets under the given constraints.

**Correctness:** **False**
