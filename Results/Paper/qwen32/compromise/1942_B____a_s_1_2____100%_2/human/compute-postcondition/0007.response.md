The code snippet `p[i] = mex - a[i]` modifies the list `p` by setting the `i`-th element to `mex - a[i]`. Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `p`, and `mex` remain unchanged except for the `i`-th element of `p`. The `i`-th element of `p` is now `mex - a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers where the `i`-th element is `mex - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`; `mex` is equal to `n`**.
