The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split string to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `a`. The variables `t` and `n` are not modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state will include the new list `a` along with the unchanged values of `t` and `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
