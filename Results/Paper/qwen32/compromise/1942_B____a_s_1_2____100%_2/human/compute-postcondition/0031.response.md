To determine the final state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables `p` and `mex` as it iterates from `i = n-1` down to `i = 0`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(0 < t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `p` is a list of `-1` with length `n`.
   - `mex` is `n`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i = n-1` down to `i = 0`.
   - For each iteration `i`:
     - `p[i]` is set to `mex - a[i]`.
     - `mex` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `p` will have been updated for all indices from `n-1` to `0`.
   - `mex` will be the smallest value encountered in the list `p` during the loop's execution.

Given the above, the final output state is:

- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `p` will be a list where each element `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]` during the loop's execution, with `mex` being updated at each step.
- `mex` will be the smallest value in the list `p`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers where each `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]` at the time of its calculation, with `mex` being updated to the minimum of its current value and `p[i]` at each step; `mex` is the smallest value in the list `p`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `p` will have values computed as `mex - a[i]` for each index `i`, and `mex` will be the smallest value found in the list `p`.
