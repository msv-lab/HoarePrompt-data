The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`. This line of code takes an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `p`, `mex`) are not affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1
- `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input
- `p` is a list of integers where each `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]` at the time of its calculation, with `mex` being updated to the minimum of its current value and `p[i]` at each step
- `mex` is the smallest value in the list `p`

After executing `n = int(input())`, the value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers where each `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]` at the time of its calculation, with `mex` being updated to the minimum of its current value and `p[i]` at each step; `mex` is the smallest value in the list `p`.**
