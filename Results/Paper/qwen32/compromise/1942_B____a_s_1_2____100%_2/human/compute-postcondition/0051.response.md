Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it computes and prints a list `p` where each element `p[i]` is determined by subtracting the corresponding element `a[i]` from a value `mex` that is updated to ensure `p` is a valid permutation.**
