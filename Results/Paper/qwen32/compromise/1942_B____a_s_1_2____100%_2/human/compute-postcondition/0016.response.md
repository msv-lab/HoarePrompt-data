To determine what will be printed when the `print(*p)` statement is executed, we need to analyze the initial state and the computations involved in the code.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1.
3. `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
4. `p` is a list of integers where the i-th element is `mex - a[i]` for all \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\).
5. `mex` is the minimum value of `n` and all `p[i]` values computed during the loop iterations.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization of `p`**:
   - `p` is initialized as a list where each element is calculated as `mex - a[i]`.
   - `mex` is defined as the minimum value of `n` and all `p[i]` values computed during the loop iterations.

2. **Calculation of `mex`**:
   - `mex` starts as `n`.
   - For each element in `a`, `mex` is recalculated as the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]` (where `p[i] = mex - a[i]`).

3. **Determining `p` Values**:
   - Each `p[i]` is initially set to `mex - a[i]`.
   - Since `mex` is recalculated based on the values of `p[i]`, the final `mex` value is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the adjusted list `a` after the loop iterations.

4. **Output of `p`**:
   - The `print(*p)` statement will print all elements of the list `p` separated by spaces.

### Detailed Explanation:
- The loop iteratively adjusts `mex` to ensure it is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `a` after the transformation `p[i] = mex - a[i]`.
- The final `p[i]` values are based on this adjusted `mex`.

### Example:
Let's assume `n = 5` and `a = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.

1. Initially, `mex = 5`.
2. Compute `p`:
   - `p[0] = mex - a[0] = 5 - 0 = 5`
   - `p[1] = mex - a[1] = 5 - 1 = 4`
   - `p[2] = mex - a[2] = 5 - 2 = 3`
   - `p[3] = mex - a[3] = 5 - 3 = 2`
   - `p[4] = mex - a[4] = 5 - 4 = 1`
3. Recalculate `mex` based on `p`:
   - The smallest non-negative integer not in `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` is `0`.
   - Adjust `p`:
     - `p[0] = 0 - a[0] = 0 - 0 = 0`
     - `p[1] = 0 - a[1] = 0 - 1 = -1`
     - `p[2] = 0 - a[2] = 0 - 2 = -2`
     - `p[3] = 0 - a[3] = 0 - 3 = -3`
     - `p[4] = 0 - a[4] = 0 - 4 = -4`
4. Final `p` is `[0, -1, -2, -3, -4]`.

### Output:
Thus, the final output will be the list `p` with each element separated by spaces.

Output: **0 -1 -2 -3 -4 (where p is the list [mex - a[0], mex - a[1], ..., mex - a[n-1]], and mex is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the adjusted list a after the loop iterations)**
