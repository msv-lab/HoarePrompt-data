The code snippet `p[i] = mex - a[i]` updates the value of `p[i]` based on the current values of `mex` and `a[i]`. Since `mex` is the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`, and `p[i]` is initially `-1`, `mex` is effectively the smallest integer that is not in the list `a` up to the current point. After executing the code snippet, the value of `p[i]` will be `mex - a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers where `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]` and all other elements remain `-1`; `mex` is the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`; `i` is incremented by 1; `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`.**
