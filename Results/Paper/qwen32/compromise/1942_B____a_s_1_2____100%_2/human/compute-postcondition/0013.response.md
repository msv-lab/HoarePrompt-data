Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers where the `i`-th element is updated to `mex - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`; `mex` is the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`; `i` is `n - 3` and `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`.**

Natural language explanation: The value of `p[i]` has been updated to `mex - a[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `mex`, and `i` remain unchanged. The `mex` value is also updated to be the minimum of its current value and the newly calculated `p[i]`.
