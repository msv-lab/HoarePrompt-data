The code snippet `p[i] = mex - a[i]` modifies the value at index `i` of the list `p`. Given the initial state, `p` is a list of `-1` with length `n`, and `mex` is equal to `n`. The value at `p[i]` is now updated to `mex - a[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers where `p[i]` is `n - a[i]` and all other elements remain `-1`; `mex` is `n`**.
