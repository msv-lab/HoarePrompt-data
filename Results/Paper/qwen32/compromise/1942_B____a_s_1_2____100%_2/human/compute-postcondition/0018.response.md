Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers where the i-th element is `mex - a[i]` for all i from 0 to n-1; `mex` is the minimum value of `n` and all `p[i]` values computed during the loop iterations.**

Explanation: The code snippet only updates the value of `n` by reading an integer input. The values of `t`, `a`, `p`, and `mex` remain unchanged.
