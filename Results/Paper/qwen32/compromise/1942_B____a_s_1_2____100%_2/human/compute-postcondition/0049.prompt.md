Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n <= `a_i` <= n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation `p` for the given data.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = [-1] * n
    mex = n
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        p[i] = mex - a[i]
        mex = min(mex, p[i])
    print(*p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers where the i-th element is `mex - a[i]` for all i from 0 to n-1; `mex` is the minimum value of `n` and all `p[i]` values computed during the loop iterations.`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers where each `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]` at the time of its calculation, with `mex` being updated to the minimum of its current value and `p[i]` at each step; `mex` is the smallest value in the list `p`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: - `t` remains the same.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `p` will have `p[i]` updated to `mex - a[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - `mex` will be the minimum value of `n` and all `p[i]` values after the loop finishes.

The final `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the list `p` after all updates. Since `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]` and `mex` keeps reducing, `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the list `a`.

Output State:




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
