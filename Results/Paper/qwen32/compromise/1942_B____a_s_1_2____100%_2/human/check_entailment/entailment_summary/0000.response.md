Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to construct the permutation `p` based on the array `a` as described in the problem statement. The core logic of the program is to iterate through the array `a` in reverse order, compute the corresponding element of `p` using the formula `p[i] = mex - a[i]`, and then update the `mex` value to be the minimum of its current value and the newly computed `p[i]`. This approach ensures that `p` is a valid permutation.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the highest possible value that `mex` can take initially.
   - `p` is initialized as an array of `-1` of length `n`.

2. **Reverse Iteration**:
   - The program iterates over the array `a` in reverse order (from `n-1` to `0`).
   - For each index `i`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.

3. **Updating `mex`**:
   - After calculating `p[i]`, `mex` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always holds the smallest non-negative integer that has not yet been used in `p`.

4. **Output**:
   - After constructing `p` for a test case, the program prints `p`.

The reverse iteration and the way `mex` is updated ensure that `p` is a valid permutation. This is because:
- `mex` starts at `n` and decreases as elements are assigned to `p`.
- Each `p[i]` is computed such that it is a non-negative integer and has not been used before.
- The `mex` update ensures that no two elements of `p` are the same, thus maintaining the uniqueness of elements in `p`.

Given that the problem guarantees at least one valid `p` for the input, and the program constructs `p` correctly based on the provided logic, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
