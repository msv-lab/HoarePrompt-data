### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the program, we need to verify whether the logic implemented in the function correctly constructs a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a`.

The core logic of the function is as follows:
1. Initialize `p` as an array of `-1` values of length `n`.
2. Initialize `mex` to `n`.
3. Iterate over the array `a` in reverse order.
4. For each element `a[i]` in `a`, compute `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
5. Update `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`.
6. Print the resulting permutation `p`.

The key point here is to ensure that `p` remains a valid permutation (i.e., contains all integers from `0` to `n-1` exactly once) and that the array `a` is correctly constructed from `p` according to the definition provided.

Let's analyze the correctness step-by-step:

- **Initialization**: `p` is initialized with `-1` values, which will be replaced with actual values.
- **Reverse Iteration**: The reverse iteration ensures that `mex` is correctly updated to reflect the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `p`.
- **Computation of `p[i]`**: For each `a[i]`, `p[i]` is computed as `mex - a[i]`. This ensures that `p[i]` is a non-negative integer and is chosen such that the MEX condition holds for the prefix of `p` up to `i`.
- **Updating `mex`**: After computing `p[i]`, `mex` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`, ensuring that `mex` always represents the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `p`.

Since the problem guarantees that at least one valid permutation `p` exists for the given `a`, the logic should correctly construct such a permutation.

### Correctness:
Given the analysis, the program correctly constructs a valid permutation `p` for each test case based on the given array `a`. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
