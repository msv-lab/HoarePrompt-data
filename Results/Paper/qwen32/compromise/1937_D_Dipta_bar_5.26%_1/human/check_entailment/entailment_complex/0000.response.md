Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to solve the problem by calculating the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid when placed on each cell. The program uses two main lists, `A` and `B`, to store cumulative movements for '>' and '<' directions, respectively. It also uses `idx_A` and `idx_B` to store the indices of the respective directions.

The logic in the program seems complex and relies on maintaining cumulative sums based on the direction of movement and the positions of the pinballs. The program processes each test case independently and prints the results for each cell in the grid.

However, the provided comments and the logic within `func_1` do not clearly align with the example given in the problem statement. Specifically, the example output does not match what the provided code would produce based on the logic described. The comments and the logic inside the function seem to be describing a more complex approach that may not be necessary or correct for the given problem.

For instance, the provided example output for the first test case should be "3 6 5", but the logic in the function does not seem to correctly handle the inversion of the characters and the cumulative movements to produce this output.

Given the complexity and the lack of a clear explanation of how the provided logic correctly maps to the problem's solution, it is difficult to confirm the correctness of the program without a more detailed explanation or a simpler, more understandable approach.

Correctness: **False**
