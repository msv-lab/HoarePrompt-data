To determine the output state, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables `A` and `idx_A` based on the input string `s`.

Let's break down what the loop does:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `s` is a string of '<' and '>'.
   - `n` is the length of `s`.
   - `A` is an empty list.
   - `idx_A` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in `s` using the index `i`.
   - If the character `s[i]` is '>', it checks the length of `idx_A`.
     - If `idx_A` is empty, it appends `0` to `A`.
     - If `idx_A` is not empty, it calculates `x` as `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)` and appends `x` to `A`.
   - It then appends the current index `i` to `idx_A`.

Let's consider a simple example to illustrate this:

**Example:**
- `s = ">>><<>"`, `n = 6`
- Initial State: `A = []`, `idx_A = []`

**Iteration Details:**

- **Iteration 1 (i = 0, s[0] = '>'):**
  - `idx_A` is empty, so `A` becomes `[0]`.
  - `idx_A` becomes `[0]`.

- **Iteration 2 (i = 1, s[1] = '>'):**
  - `idx_A` is not empty, so `x = A[0] + (1 - 0) * 1 = 0 + 1 * 1 = 1`.
  - `A` becomes `[0, 1]`.
  - `idx_A` becomes `[0, 1]`.

- **Iteration 3 (i = 2, s[2] = '>'):**
  - `idx_A` is not empty, so `x = A[1] + (2 - 1) * 2 = 1 + 1 * 2 = 3`.
  - `A` becomes `[0, 1, 3]`.
  - `idx_A` becomes `[0, 1, 2]`.

- **Iteration 4 (i = 3, s[3] = '<'):**
  - No changes to `A` or `idx_A` because the character is not '>'.

- **Iteration 5 (i = 4, s[4] = '<'):**
  - No changes to `A` or `idx_A` because the character is not '>'.

- **Iteration 6 (i = 5, s[5] = '>'):**
  - `idx_A` is not empty, so `x = A[2] + (5 - 2) * 3 = 3 + 3 * 3 = 12`.
  - `A` becomes `[0, 1, 3, 12]`.
  - `idx_A` becomes `[0, 1, 2, 5]`.

So, after all iterations, the final state is:
- `A = [0, 1, 3, 12]`
- `idx_A = [0, 1, 2, 5]`

Output State: **A is [0, 1, 3, 12]; idx_A is [0, 1, 2, 5].**
