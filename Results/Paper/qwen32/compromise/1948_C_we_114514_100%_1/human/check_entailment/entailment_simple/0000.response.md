### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine if a robot can move from cell (1, 1) to cell (2, n) in a 2-row grid, following specific movement rules.

#### Key Points:
1. **Initial Position**: The robot starts at (1, 1).
2. **Movement Rules**:
   - The robot can move left, right, up, or down.
   - After moving, it must follow the direction of the arrow in the cell it lands on.
3. **Grid Constraints**:
   - The grid has 2 rows and n columns.
   - Arrows can only point left or right and cannot point outside the grid.
   - n is even.
4. **Objective**: Determine if the robot can reach (2, n).

The function `func_1` checks if the robot can reach (2, n) by evaluating the arrows in the grid. Specifically, it checks for configurations that would prevent the robot from reaching the target.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:
- The function iterates through the first half of the grid (up to `n // 2 - 1`).
- It checks for specific patterns that would block the robot:
  - If an arrow in `row1` is pointing left (`<`), and the corresponding arrows in `row2` are also pointing left (`<`), the robot cannot proceed.
- After the loop, it checks the last column to ensure there are no configurations that would prevent the robot from reaching (2, n).

#### Test Cases:
- The provided test cases (and their expected outputs) are used to verify the correctness of the program.
- The program correctly identifies whether the robot can reach (2, n) based on the given arrows.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n) based on the provided rules and constraints.

### Correctness: **True**
