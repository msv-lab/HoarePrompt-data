To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the context in which the `results` list is populated.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer.
- `row1` and `row2` are strings from the last iteration.
- `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each being the output of `func_1` for each iteration.

### Code to Analyze:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Analysis:
- The `results` list contains `t` elements, each of which is the output of the function `func_1` for each iteration.
- The `'\n'.join(results)` function call concatenates all the elements in the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`).

### Explanation:
Since the exact values of `results` are not provided, we can't determine the precise output string. However, based on the precondition, we know that `results` contains the outputs of `func_1` for each iteration, and these outputs will be joined by newline characters.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the elements of the `results` list, each on a new line.

Output: **result1\nresult2\n...\nresultt (where result1, result2, ..., resultt are the outputs of `func_1` for each iteration)**
