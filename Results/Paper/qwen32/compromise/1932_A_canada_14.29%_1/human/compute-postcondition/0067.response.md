Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is the input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `i` is the next character in the list `s`. If `i` is '@', `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 0. Otherwise, `ret` is 0. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is either 1 or 3, and if `thorn` was 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `thorn` remains either 0 or 2. If `i` is not '*', `thorn` remains either 0 or 2 without any changes to the variables.**
