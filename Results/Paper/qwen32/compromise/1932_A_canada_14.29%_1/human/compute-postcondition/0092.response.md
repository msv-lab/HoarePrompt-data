The provided code snippet contains only a `break` statement, which will exit the most inner loop or if statement it is placed within. Since there is no loop or if statement in the context provided, the `break` statement will have no effect on the variables or the program flow in this specific scenario. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`thorn` is 2; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is the integer input by the user; `s` is a non-empty list of characters; `ret` is 0; the variable `i` is equal to '*'**.
