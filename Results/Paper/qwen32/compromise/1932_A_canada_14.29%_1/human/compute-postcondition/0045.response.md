To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop is defined as:

```python
for i in s:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop iterates over each element in the list `s`. Therefore, the only object in the loop head that we can adjust is the list `s`.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `s`**: This is the list of characters that the loop iterates over. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must contain at least one character.
2. **Variable `i`**: This is the loop variable that takes on the value of each element in `s` during each iteration. The initial value of `i` does not need to be adjusted because it is assigned the value of the first element in `s` during the first iteration.
3. **Other Variables (`t`, `len`, `ret`, `thorn`)**: These variables are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:
To ensure that the loop executes, the list `s` must have at least one character.

### State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is the input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `ret` is 0; `thorn` is 0**
