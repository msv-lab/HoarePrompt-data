The given code snippet sets the variable `thorn` to 0. This does not affect the values of the other variables (`t`, `len`, `s`, `ret`, `i`). Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters; `ret` is 1 if the current character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0; `thorn` is 0; `i` is the next character in the list `s`**.
