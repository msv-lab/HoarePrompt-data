Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters; `i` is the next character in the list `s`. If `thorn` was equal to 2, `thorn` is increased by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `thorn` is increased by 1 and the program continues.**
