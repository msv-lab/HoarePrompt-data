Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is the integer input by the user; `s` is a non-empty list of characters; `ret` is either 1 or 2 if `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0; `thorn` is 3 if the current character `i` is '*' and `thorn` was 2 before, otherwise `thorn` is 1 if `i` is '*', `thorn` remains 2 if `i` is '*' and `thorn` was 2 before, and remains 0 if `i` is not '@' and not '*'; `i` is the next character in the list `s`. If `thorn` was 2 and `i` is '*', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
