The code snippet `ret += 1` increments the value of the variable `ret` by 1. Given the initial state, `ret` is either 0 or 1 based on whether the current character `i` is '@' or not. After this operation, `ret` will be 1 if it was 0, or 2 if it was 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is the integer input by the user; `s` is a non-empty list of characters; `ret` is either 1 or 2; `thorn` is 0; `i` is the next character in the list `s`.**
