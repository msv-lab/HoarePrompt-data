The value of `ret` is incremented by 1. Given that `ret` was either 1 or 2 if the current character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` was 0, after the increment, `ret` will be either 2 or 3 if the current character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` will be 1. The values of the other variables (`t`, `len`, `s`, `thorn`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the integer input by the user, `s` is a non-empty list of characters, `ret` is either 2 or 3 if the current character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 1, `thorn` is 0, `i` is the next character in the list `s` after the current `i`.**
