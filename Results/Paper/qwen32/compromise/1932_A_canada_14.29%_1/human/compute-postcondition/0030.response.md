The code snippet `ret += 1` increments the value of the variable `ret` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the initial value of `ret`, we can only state that it will be increased by 1. The other variables (`t`, `len`, `s`, `i`, `thorn`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters; `i` is the next character in the list `s`; `thorn` is 0; `ret` is increased by 1.**
