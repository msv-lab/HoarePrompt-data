The given code snippet `thorn == 0` is a comparison operation, not an assignment. It checks if the variable `thorn` is equal to 0, but it does not change the value of `thorn` or any other variable. Therefore, the state of the program remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is the integer input by the user; `s` is a non-empty list of characters; `ret` is 0; `thorn` is 0; the variable `i` is not equal to '@' and `i` is not equal to '*'**
