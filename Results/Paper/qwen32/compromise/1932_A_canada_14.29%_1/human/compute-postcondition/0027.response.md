Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters; `ret` is 2 if the current character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 1 if the current character `i` is neither '@' nor '*', and `ret` is 1 if the current character `i` is '*' but `thorn` is not 2; `thorn` is 0 if the current character `i` is neither '@' nor '*', `thorn` is incremented by 1 if the current character `i` is '*', and if `thorn` equals 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of; `i` is the next character in the list `s`.***
