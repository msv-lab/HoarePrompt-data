The code snippet `ans1 += a[i]` adds the value of `a[0]` (since `i` is 0) to `ans1`. Given that `ans1` is initially the sum of the elements in `a` from the `x-th` element to the end of the list, after this operation, `ans1` will be the sum of all elements from the `x-th` element to the end of the list plus the first element of the list `a[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input where `k` must be greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of the elements in `a` from the `x-th` element to the end of the list plus `a[0]`; `i` is 0; `ans2` is equal to the sum of the elements in `a` from the `x-th` element to the end of the list.**
