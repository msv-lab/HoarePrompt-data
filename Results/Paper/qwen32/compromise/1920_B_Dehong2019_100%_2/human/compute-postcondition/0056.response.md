The code snippet `ans1 += a[i]` adds the value of `a[i]` to `ans1`. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` remains the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are the integers read from the input.
- `a` is the sorted list of integers in descending order.
- `i` is `x + 2`.
- If `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is its previous value plus `a[i]` minus `a[i + x] * 2`; otherwise, `ans1` remains unchanged.
- `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and its previous value.

After executing `ans1 += a[i]`, `ans1` will be updated to its previous value plus `a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` remains the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are the integers read from the input; `a` is the sorted list of integers in descending order; `i` is `x + 2`; `ans1` is its previous value plus `a[i]`; `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and its previous value.**
