Postcondition: **`t` remains the input integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are the integers read from the input; `a` is the sorted list of integers in descending order; `i` is `x` and `i + x < n`; `ans2` is the sum of the list `a` minus `2 * (sum of the first x elements of a)`; `ans1` is the sum of the list `a` minus `2 * (sum of the first x elements of a)` plus `a[x]`; `k` must be greater than 0.**
