Postcondition: **`t` remains the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are the integers read from the input; `a` is the sorted list of integers in descending order; `i` is `x + 1`. If `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is its previous value plus `a[i]` minus `a[i + x] * 2`; otherwise, `ans1` remains unchanged. In both cases, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and its previous value.**
