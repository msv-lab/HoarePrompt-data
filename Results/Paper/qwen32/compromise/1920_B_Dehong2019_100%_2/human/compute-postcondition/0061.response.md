To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans2)` statement, we need to understand the calculations and variables involved based on the given initial state.

### Variables and Their Definitions:
- `t`: An input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This likely indicates the number of test cases, but it does not directly affect the calculation of `ans2` for a single iteration.
- `n`, `k`, `x`: Integers read from the input.
- `a`: A sorted list of integers in descending order.
- `i`: Calculated as `x + k - 1`.
- `ans1`: Calculated as:
  - `sum(a) - 2 * (sum of the first x elements of a) + sum(a[i] for i from x to x + k - 1) - 2 * a[i + x] for each i where i + x < n`.
- `ans2`: The maximum value of `ans1` across all iterations (likely across different test cases).

### Calculation Breakdown:
1. **Sum of List `a`**: This is the total sum of all elements in the list `a`.
2. **Sum of First `x` Elements**: This is the sum of the first `x` elements of the list `a`.
3. **Sum of Elements from Index `x` to `x + k - 1`**: This is the sum of elements in the sublist starting from index `x` to `x + k - 1`.
4. **Subtract Twice the Elements Beyond `x + k - 1`**: For each index `i` such that `i + x < n`, subtract twice the element at index `i + x`.

### Deriving `ans1`:
- `ans1` is a combination of the total sum of the list `a`, adjusted by subtracting twice the sum of the first `x` elements and adding the sum of the next `k` elements, then further adjusted by subtracting twice the elements beyond the initial `x + k` range.

### Deriving `ans2`:
- `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` across all iterations (test cases). Since `t` is the number of test cases, `ans2` represents the highest value of `ans1` obtained from any of these test cases.

### Final Output:
The `print(ans2)` statement will output the maximum value of `ans1` across all test cases.

Output: **ans2 (where ans2 is the maximum value of ans1 across all test cases)**
