Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, `x`, and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it computes and prints a value that is derived by adjusting the sum of the array based on the values of `k` and `x`. Specifically, it maximizes a computed sum by adding the largest `k` elements and subtracting twice the largest `x` elements, considering overlaps appropriately.**
