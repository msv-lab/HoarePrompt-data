Postcondition: **`t` remains the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input with `x` greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order; `i` is `x`; if `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is the previous value of `ans1` plus `a[i]` minus `a[i + x] * 2`; `ans2` is `max(ans1, ans2)`; `k` is greater than 0. If `i + x` is not less than `n`, `ans1` and `ans2` remain unchanged.**
