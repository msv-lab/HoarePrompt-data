The only variable in the loop head is `num`, which will take on the value of each element in the list `arr` during each iteration of the loop. The loop will execute as long as `arr` is not empty, because the loop iterates over each element in `arr`.

Given that the state before the loop starts includes `arr` as a list of integers and `k` as an integer, and `frequency_table` as an empty dictionary, we need to ensure that `arr` has at least one element for the loop to execute. The values of `k` and `frequency_table` do not affect whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to run.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `arr` has at least one element. Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary**
