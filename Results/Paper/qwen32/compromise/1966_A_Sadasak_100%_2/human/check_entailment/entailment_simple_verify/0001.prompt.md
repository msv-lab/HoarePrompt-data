You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the specified operations. The operations allow us to exchange any `k` cards of the same number for `k-1` cards of any number. 

### Key Points:
1. **Input**: 
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of cards.
     - `k`: Number of cards to exchange.
     - `nums`: List of numbers on the cards.

2. **Output**:
   - Minimum number of cards left after any number of operations.

3. **Logic**:
   - If `k > n`, no operations can be performed, so the answer is `n`.
   - Otherwise, we need to count the frequency of each card number and determine the optimal way to reduce the number of cards.

### Program Analysis:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of cards left. Here's why:

1. **Handling `k > n`**:
   - The program correctly prints `n` if `k > n` since no operations can be performed.

2. **Counting Frequencies**:
   - The program uses a function `func_1` to create a frequency table of the card numbers. However, the function truncates frequencies to `k`, which is incorrect. We should count the actual frequencies.

3. **Determining Minimum Cards**:
   - The program incorrectly checks if `k` is in the frequency values and prints `k-1` if true. This logic is flawed. We need to use the frequencies to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations.

### Correct Approach:
- Count the frequency of each card number.
- For each unique card number with frequency `f`, we can perform `(f // k)` operations, reducing the count of that card by `(f % k)`.
- The sum of these reduced counts will give the minimum number of cards left.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it truncates frequencies and uses an incorrect logic to determine the minimum number of cards left.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
