Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the allowed operations. Here are the key issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Frequencies**: The function `func_1` is supposed to build a frequency table of the card numbers, but it incorrectly caps the frequency at `k`. This is not necessary and incorrect for the problem. The frequency of each card should be counted without any upper limit.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Cards**: The program checks if `k` is in the frequency values and then prints `k - 1` if true, which is not the correct logic to determine the minimum number of cards left. The program does not correctly simulate the process of exchanging cards to minimize the total number of cards.

3. **Missing Core Logic**: The core logic of exchanging cards to minimize the number of cards is not implemented. The correct approach involves using the frequencies of each card and repeatedly exchanging groups of `k` cards to reduce the count.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each card
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in nums:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of cards left
    min_cards = 0
    for count in frequency_table.values():
        # For each group of k cards, we can reduce the count by 1
        min_cards += count % k
    
    # If min_cards is 0, we need at least one card left
    if min_cards == 0:
        min_cards = k if n >= k else n
    
    print(min_cards)
```

This corrected program correctly counts the frequency of each card, calculates the minimum number of cards left by considering the remainder when dividing the frequency by `k`, and ensures that at least one card is left if the result would otherwise be zero.
