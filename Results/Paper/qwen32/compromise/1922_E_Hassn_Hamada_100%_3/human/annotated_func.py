#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `number` and a list `sequence`. It modifies `sequence` to potentially satisfy the condition of having exactly `number` increasing subsequences. If no such sequence can be generated, it returns -1. Otherwise, the function returns (0, 0). However, based on the provided code, the function does not handle the case where no valid sequence exists and always returns (0, 0) if `number` is not 0.
