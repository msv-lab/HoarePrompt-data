The provided code snippet is a function definition without any implementation details. Therefore, the execution of this function does not change the values of the variables `number` and `sequence` as no operations are performed within the function body. The function is supposed to generate a sequence based on the input `number`, but since there is no implementation, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and `sequence` is a list of integers representing the array. The length of the sequence should be at most 200 if it satisfies the condition of having exactly 'number' increasing subsequences. If no such sequence exists, sequence should be an empty list or the function should handle the case internally to return -1.**
