To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop and the given output states after the first three iterations.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates from `max(sequence, default=0)` down to `-1` with a step of `-1`. During each iteration, it calculates `size` and `value` and checks if `value` is less than or equal to `number`. If it is, it sets `size_overlap` to `(size, i)` and breaks out of the loop.

### Given Output States:
1. **After 1 iteration**:
   - `size` is `floor(log2(number + 1)) - 1`
   - `value` is `2^(floor(log2(number + 1)) - 1) - 1`
   - If `value <= number`, `size_overlap` is `(size, i)`

2. **After 2 iterations**:
   - `size` is `60`
   - `value` is `1152921504606846976` (which is `2^60`)
   - `i` is `0`
   - If `value <= number`, `size_overlap` is `(60, 0)`

3. **After 3 iterations**:
   - `size` is `6`
   - `value` is `62` (which is `2^6 - 2^1`)
   - `i` is `1`
   - If `value <= number`, `size_overlap` is `(6, 1)`

### Final Output State:
The loop will continue to iterate until it finds a `value` that is less than or equal to `number`, or it exhausts all possible values of `i`. Given the nature of the calculations, `size` and `value` are derived based on powers of 2 and their differences. The loop will eventually find the largest `size` such that `value` (which is `2^size - 2^i`) is less than or equal to `number`.

The loop breaks as soon as it finds such a valid pair `(size, i)`. The values of `size` and `i` will be the ones that satisfy the condition `value <= number` for the first time during the iteration.

### Conclusion:
The final `size_overlap` will be the first valid pair `(size, i)` that satisfies `value <= number` during the loop iterations. Given the provided states, the most likely final state is the one where `value` is calculated to be less than or equal to `number` for the first time.

### Final Output State:
Since the loop breaks as soon as it finds a valid pair, and based on the given states, the final output state is likely to be one of the valid pairs found during the iterations.

Output State: **size_overlap is (6, 1) if 62 <= number, otherwise the first valid (size, i) pair found.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is the first pair `(size, i)` where `2^size - 2^i` is less than or equal to `number`. If `number` is at least 62, the final output state will be `(6, 1)`. Otherwise, it will be the first valid pair found during the iterations.
