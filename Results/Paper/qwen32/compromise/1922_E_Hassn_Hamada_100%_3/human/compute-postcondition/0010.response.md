To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop statement:

```
while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number:
    # the loop body is omit
```

This condition depends on the variables `size`, `i`, and `number`. Let's analyze the condition:

- `(1 << size + 1)` is equivalent to \(2^{(size + 1)}\).
- `(1 << i)` is equivalent to \(2^i\).
- The condition is true if \(2^{(size + 1)} - 2^i \leq \text{number}\).

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\).
- `sequence` is a list of integers with at least one element.
- `size_overlap` is (0, 0).
- `size` is 2.
- `i` is 0.
- `value` is 3.

Let's substitute the values of `size` and `i` into the condition:
- \(2^{(size + 1)} = 2^{(2 + 1)} = 2^3 = 8\).
- \(2^i = 2^0 = 1\).
- The condition becomes \(8 - 1 \leq \text{number}\), or \(7 \leq \text{number}\).

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `number` must be at least 7. Since the current state specifies that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), we need to adjust `number` to be at least 7.

No other variables (`size` and `i`) need to be adjusted because the condition is already satisfied by adjusting `number` to be at least 7.

State: **`number` must be at least 7, `sequence` is a list of integers with at least one element, `size_overlap` is (0, 0), `size` is 2, `i` is 0, `value` is 3**
