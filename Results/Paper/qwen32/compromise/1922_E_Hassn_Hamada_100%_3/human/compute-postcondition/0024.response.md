Output State: **`number` must be at least 3, `sequence` is a list of integers with at least one element, `size` is 2, `value` is 2, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `size` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. All other variables retain their original values as specified in the initial state.
