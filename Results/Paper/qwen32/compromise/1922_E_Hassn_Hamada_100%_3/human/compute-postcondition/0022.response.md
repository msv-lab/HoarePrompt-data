The code snippet updates the values of `size` and `value` based on the current value of `i`. Here is the impact of the code on the program:

- `size` is reassigned the value of `i + 1`.
- `value` is reassigned the value of `(1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)`, which simplifies to `2^(i + 1) - 2^i`.

Given the initial state, `i` is `i + 1` from a previous state, which means `i` is incremented by 1 before this code runs. Therefore, the new value of `size` will be the incremented `i` plus 1, and the new value of `value` will be calculated as described above.

Output State: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers with at least one element, `size` is `i + 1`, `value` is `2^(i + 1) - 2^i`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
