The code snippet assigns the tuple `(size, i)` to the variable `size_overlap`. Given that `size` and `i` are not defined in the initial state, we can infer that `i` must be defined elsewhere in the code not provided here. For the purpose of this task, we will assume `i` has some value.

The values of `number`, `sequence`, `size`, and `value` remain unchanged. The only change is the assignment to `size_overlap`.

Output State: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers with at least one element, `size_overlap` is (size, i), `size` is floor(log2(number + 1)) - 1, `value` is 2^(floor(log2(number + 1)) - 1) - 1, and `value` is less than or equal to `number`.**
