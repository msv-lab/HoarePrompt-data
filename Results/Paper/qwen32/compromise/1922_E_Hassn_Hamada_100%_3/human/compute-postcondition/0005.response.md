To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head is defined as:

```python
for i in range(max(sequence, default=0), -1, -1):
```

The variables involved in this loop head are:
- `i`: The loop variable.
- `sequence`: The list of integers that determines the starting point of the loop via `max(sequence, default=0)`.

### Analysis:

1. **`sequence`**: This list is used to determine the starting point of the loop with `max(sequence, default=0)`. If `sequence` is empty, `max(sequence, default=0)` will return `0`.

2. **`i`**: The loop variable `i` starts from `max(sequence, default=0)` and decrements down to `-1`.

### Conditions for Loop Execution:

- For the loop to execute at least once, `max(sequence, default=0)` must be greater than or equal to `0`. 
- If `sequence` is empty, `max(sequence, default=0)` will return `0`, and the loop will execute with `i` starting from `0` and decrementing to `-1`.

### Adjustments:

- The state of `sequence` needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute. The simplest way to guarantee this is to ensure that `sequence` is not empty and contains at least one element. If `sequence` is empty, the loop will still execute with `i` starting from `0`.

### Adjusted State:

Given the conditions, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `sequence` is not empty. We can choose any integer value for the single element in `sequence`, but for simplicity, we can use `1`.

State: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers with at least one element (e.g., `[1]`), `size_overlap` is (0, 0)**

This ensures that the loop will execute with `i` starting from `max(sequence, default=0)` which is `1` in this case, and decrementing down to `-1`.
