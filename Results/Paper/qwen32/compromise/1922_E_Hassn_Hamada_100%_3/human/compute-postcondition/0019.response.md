Output State: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers with at least one element, `size_overlap` is (size, i), `size` is floor(log2(number + 1)) - 1, `value` is 2^(floor(log2(number + 1)) - 1) - 1, and `value` is less than or equal to `number`.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not affect any of the variables in the given initial state. Therefore, all variables retain their original values and conditions.
