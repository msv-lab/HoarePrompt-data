### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem of generating an array with exactly X increasing subsequences. However, there are several issues with the implementation:

1. **Base Case Handling**: The base case in `func_1` is incorrect. The function is supposed to handle the case when `number` is 0 by returning an empty sequence or a specific value indicating no more work is needed. However, it currently returns `(0, 0)`, which is not useful for the logic of building the sequence.

2. **Loop Logic**: The loop logic for finding `size_overlap` is flawed. The loop iterates from `max(sequence, default=0)` down to `-1`, which doesn't make sense in the context of generating the sequence. It also calculates `size` and `value` incorrectly, and the while loop inside doesn't correctly update `size` and `value` to find the appropriate values.

3. **Appending to Sequence**: The logic for appending to the sequence is incorrect. It appends values from `overlap` to `size - overlap + overlap`, which doesn't align with the intention of building the sequence to have exactly X increasing subsequences.

4. **Recursive Call**: The recursive call to `func_1` is made with `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)`, but this doesn't correctly reduce the problem size in a way that ensures the sequence will have exactly X increasing subsequences.

5. **Output Handling**: The program does not handle the case where no such sequence can be generated, and it does not print `-1` as required.

Given these issues, the program is not correctly implementing the logic needed to generate the desired sequence for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
