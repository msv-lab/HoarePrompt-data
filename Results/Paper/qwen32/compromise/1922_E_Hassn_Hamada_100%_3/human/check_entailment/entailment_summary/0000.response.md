Reasoning:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem of finding an array with exactly X increasing subsequences. However, there are several issues with the implementation that make it incorrect:

1. **Handling of the Base Case**: The function `func_1` is supposed to modify the `sequence` list to generate the required number of increasing subsequences. However, it does not handle the case where no such sequence can be generated. The function always returns (0, 0) if `number` is not 0, which does not align with the problem's requirement to return -1 if no valid sequence exists.

2. **Logic for Generating Sequence**: The logic within `func_1` uses bitwise operations to determine the size and value of the sequence elements. While this approach might be mathematically sound for some cases, it does not guarantee that the generated sequence will always have exactly X increasing subsequences for all possible values of X.

3. **Output Handling**: The main loop in the program reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case. However, the function does not return a valid sequence or -1 if no sequence exists. Instead, it modifies the `sequence` list in place and prints its length and contents. This approach is flawed because the function does not handle the case where no valid sequence can be generated.

4. **Example Mismatch**: The example provided in the problem description shows that the program should be able to generate sequences for various values of X. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle these cases, as evidenced by the execution summary.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
