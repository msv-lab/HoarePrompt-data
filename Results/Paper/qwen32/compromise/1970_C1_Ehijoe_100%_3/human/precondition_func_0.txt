n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v such that 1 <= u, v <= n representing the edges of the tree which guarantees the tree has exactly two leaves, and the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t such that 1 <= u_1, ..., u_t <= n representing the starting node for the stone in each round.
