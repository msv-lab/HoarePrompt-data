Reasoning:  
The provided program is attempting to solve the problem by simulating the game for each test case. However, there are a few issues with the logic that need to be addressed to ensure correctness.

1. **Initial Scores Calculation**: The initial scores `bp` and `sp` are set to `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively, which is correct. However, the cumulative sums `bp` and `sp` are not updated correctly in the loop. The program should be adding `a[b]` and `a[s]` to `bp` and `sp` respectively in each iteration, not resetting them.

2. **Max Score Calculation**: The variables `bm` and `sm` are supposed to keep track of the maximum possible score for Bodya and Sasha after `k` turns. The current implementation incorrectly calculates `bm` and `sm` by multiplying `a[b]` and `a[s]` by `k` and adding `bp` and `sp` respectively. Instead, the program should be keeping track of the maximum score accumulated up to each point.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs `n` times, which is not necessarily the correct number of iterations. The loop should run `k` times, but the decrement of `k` is done inside the loop, which is correct. However, the loop should break if `k` reaches 0, which is already implemented correctly.

4. **Index Adjustment**: The program correctly adjusts the indices `b` and `s` by subtracting 1 to convert from 1-based to 0-based indexing.

Given the above points, the current implementation is incorrect because it does not correctly simulate the game and calculate the maximum scores for Bodya and Sasha.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        
        bp = 0
        sp = 0
        
        for _ in range(k):
            bp += a[b]
            sp += a[s]
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
        
        if bp > sp:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bp < sp:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

This corrected version properly simulates the game by accumulating the scores for Bodya and Sasha over `k` turns and then comparing the final scores.

Correctness: **False**
