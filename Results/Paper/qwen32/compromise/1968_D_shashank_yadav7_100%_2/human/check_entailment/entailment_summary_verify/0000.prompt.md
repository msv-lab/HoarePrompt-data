You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        sp = a[s]
        bp = a[b]
        bm = a[b] * k
        sm = a[s] * k
        for i in range(n):
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                break
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
            sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
            sp += a[s]
            bp += a[b]
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, a permutation `p` of length `n`, and an array `a` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates and compares the maximum possible values of two expressions involving elements from `a` and the permutation `p`, adjusted by `k`. It then prints "Bodya" if one expression is greater, "Sasha" if the other is greater, or "Draw" if they are equal.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The provided code has a few issues that can cause it to not work correctly for all potential cases. Let's analyze the code and identify the problems:

1. **Initialization of Scores**:
   - The initial scores `bp` and `sp` are set to `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively. This is correct.
   - However, `bm` and `sm` are initialized to `a[b] * k` and `a[s] * k` respectively. This is incorrect because it assumes that the player will stay at the same position for all `k` turns, which is not necessarily the case.

2. **Updating Scores**:
   - Inside the loop, `bm` and `sm` are updated using the formula `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`. This is incorrect because it again assumes that the player will stay at the same position for the remaining `k` turns, which is not necessarily the case.
   - The scores `bp` and `sp` are correctly updated by adding `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively.

3. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition `for i in range(n)` is incorrect. It should be `for i in range(k)` because the game lasts exactly `k` turns.
   - The decrement of `k` inside the loop is not needed if the loop condition is corrected.

### Corrected Code:
Here is a corrected version of the code that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, b, s = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        bp = 0
        sp = 0
        for _ in range(k):
            bp += a[b]
            sp += a[s]
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
        if bp > sp:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bp < sp:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

```

### Explanation of Correctness:
- The scores `bp` and `sp` are initialized to 0.
- The loop runs exactly `k` times, simulating each turn of the game.
- In each turn, the scores are updated by adding the value at the current position.
- The positions are updated by moving to `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1` respectively.
- After `k` turns, the scores are compared to determine the winner.

This corrected code should work correctly for all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
