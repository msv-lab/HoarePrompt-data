Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are the integers read from the input, `i` is `min(n, initial_k) + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0 if the loop terminated early, otherwise `n - i`, `b` is the final value of `b` after all iterations minus 1, `s` is the final value of `s` after all iterations, `sp` is the cumulative sum of `a[s]` for all iterations, `bp` is the cumulative sum of `a[b]` for all iterations, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` for all iterations, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` for all iterations. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` is strictly greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**

In simple terms, the value of `b` has been decremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values.
