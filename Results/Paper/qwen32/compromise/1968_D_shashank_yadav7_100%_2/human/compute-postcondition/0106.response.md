The code snippet reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`. The previous values of `a`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, `sm`, `p`, and `i` remain unchanged except for `a`, which is now a list of integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `b` is the third integer read from the input, `s` is the fourth integer read from the input, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` across all iterations, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` across all iterations, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `i` is `i + 1`.**
