To determine what will be printed by the `print('Draw')` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the context provided. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State Description**:
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `k` is initialized to 0.
   - `b` is the final value of `b` after all iterations minus 1.
   - `s` is the final value of `s` after all iterations minus 1.
   - `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration.
   - `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration.
   - `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` across all iterations.
   - `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` across all iterations.
   - `p` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `i` is `n` if the loop completes all iterations or the point where `k` becomes 0.
   - `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`.

2. **Analysis**:
   - The `print('Draw')` statement is a simple print statement that outputs the string "Draw".
   - The value of `k` is initialized to 0, and it is mentioned that the loop might terminate when `k` becomes 0. However, the exact loop logic is not provided.
   - The variables `b`, `s`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` are described in terms of their final values after some iterations, but their exact values are not explicitly provided.
   - The condition `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm` suggests that the maximum value involving `b` is at least as large as the maximum value involving `s`.

3. **Output**:
   - The `print('Draw')` statement will output the string "Draw", regardless of the values of the other variables.

Therefore, the output of the code is:

Output: **Draw**
