Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of four integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, where `n` is the length of permutation `p` and array `a`, `k` is another integer, and `P_B` and `P_S` are specific indices. It also accepts a permutation `p` of length `n` and an array `a` of length `n`. For each test case, the function returns a value based on the given inputs, which is not explicitly detailed in the provided information.**
