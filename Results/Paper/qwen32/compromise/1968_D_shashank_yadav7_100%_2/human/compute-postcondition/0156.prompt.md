You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each testcase consists of four integers n, k, P_B, P_S where 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. The next line contains n integers p_1, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n) representing the permutation p. The following line contains n integers a_1, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) representing the array a. The sum of all n across all testcases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b -= 1
        
        s -= 1
        
        sp = a[s]
        
        bp = a[b]
        
        bm = a[b] * k
        
        sm = a[s] * k
        
        for i in range(n):
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                break
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
            sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
            sp += a[s]
            bp += a[b]
        
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
        
    #State: t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is the number of elements in the permutation and array for the last test case, k is either 0 or the initial k minus the number of iterations, b is the final value of b after all iterations for the last test case, s is the final value of s after all iterations for the last test case, p is the permutation list for the last test case, a is the array list for the last test case, i is the number of iterations the inner loop ran for the last test case, sp is the cumulative sum of a[s] for the last test case, bp is the cumulative sum of a[b] for the last test case, bm is the maximum value of a[b] * k + bp for the last test case, sm is the maximum value of a[s] * k + sp for the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of four integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, where `n` is the length of permutation `p` and array `a`, `k` is another integer, and `P_B` and `P_S` are specific indices. It also accepts a permutation `p` of length `n` and an array `a` of length `n`. For each test case, the function returns a value based on the given inputs, which is not explicitly detailed in the provided information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
