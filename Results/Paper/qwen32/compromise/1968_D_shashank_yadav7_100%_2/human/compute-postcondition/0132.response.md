The code snippet `sp += a[s]` modifies the variable `sp` by adding the value of `a[s]` to it. None of the other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is greater than 0
- `k` is either -1 or the second integer read from the input minus 2
- `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`
- `s` is `p[p[previous_s] - 1] - 1`
- `sp` is `a[s] + a[s]`
- `bp` is `2 * a[b]`
- `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`
- `sm` is `max(a[s] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp, a[s] * k + sp)`
- `p` is a list of integers read from the input
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input
- `i` is 1
- If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute the next part of the code.

After executing `sp += a[s]`, the value of `sp` is updated to `a[s] + a[s] + a[s]`, which simplifies to `3 * a[s]`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is either -1 or the second integer read from the input minus 2, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[previous_s] - 1] - 1`, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(a[s] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp, a[s] * k + sp)`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 1. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute the next part of the code.**
