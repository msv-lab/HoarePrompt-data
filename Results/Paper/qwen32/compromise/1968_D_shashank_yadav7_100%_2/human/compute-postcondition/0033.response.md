Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`**

In natural language: The value of `k` is decreased by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
