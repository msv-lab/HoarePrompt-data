The code snippet provided reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, and `p` are not altered by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state will include the newly assigned list `a` along with the pre-existing variables.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are the four integers read from the input, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
