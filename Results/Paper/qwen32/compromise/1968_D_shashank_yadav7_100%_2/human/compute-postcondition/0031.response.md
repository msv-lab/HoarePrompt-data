The code snippet `bp += a[b]` modifies the value of `bp` by adding `a[b]` to it. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `k` remains 0 if it was 0, otherwise `k` is decreased by 1.
- `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`.
- `s` is `p[s] - 1`.
- `sp` is `3 * a[s]`.
- `bp` is `2 * a[b]`.
- `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`.
- `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`.

After executing `bp += a[b]`, the value of `bp` changes from `2 * a[b]` to `2 * a[b] + a[b]`, which simplifies to `3 * a[b]`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` remains 0 if it was 0, otherwise `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`**.
