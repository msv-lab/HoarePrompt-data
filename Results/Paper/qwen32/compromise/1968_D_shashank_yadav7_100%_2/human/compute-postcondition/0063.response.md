Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is `n - i - 1` if the loop terminated early, otherwise `n - i - 1`, `b` is the final value of `b` after all iterations minus 1, `s` is the final value of `s` after all iterations minus 1, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is `a[b] * (k + 1)`, `sm` is `a[s] * (k + 1)`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 0**.

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 1, so `k` becomes `k - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
