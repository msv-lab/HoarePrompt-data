The value of `A` is flipped to its opposite value. If `A` was `True`, it becomes `False`, and if `A` was `False`, it becomes `True`. The value of `not_c` remains `True` as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`A` is `False` if `A` was `True`, `A` is `True` if `A` was `False`; `not_c` is `True`.**
