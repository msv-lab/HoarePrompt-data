Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for calculating the minimum cost to purchase the tickets is flawed. Specifically, the approach does not account for the dynamic increase in ticket prices after each purchase, which affects the subsequent days' prices. The program also incorrectly assumes that the optimal strategy is to always buy the maximum allowed tickets on the cheapest available days, which is not necessarily true given the price increase rule.

Here's a brief explanation of the issues:

1. **Dynamic Price Increase**: The program does not dynamically adjust the prices for subsequent days after each purchase. It simply calculates a cost based on the initial assumption of prices, without updating them as dictated by the problem statement.

2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation logic is flawed. The program uses a formula that does not correctly account for the increasing prices over days due to previous purchases.

3. **Greedy Approach**: The program attempts a greedy approach by sorting the prices and buying the maximum tickets on the cheapest days. However, this approach does not consider the long-term impact of price increases on future days.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using a priority queue to always buy tickets from the cheapest available day while keeping track of the increasing prices for subsequent days.
