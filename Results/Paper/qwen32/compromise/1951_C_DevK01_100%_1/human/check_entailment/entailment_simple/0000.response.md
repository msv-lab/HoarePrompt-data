Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by sorting the list of ticket prices and then buying tickets from the cheapest days first, considering the constraints of the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day and the price increase mechanism. However, there are several issues in the logic that make the code incorrect.

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost**:
   - The formula used to calculate the cost is not correctly accounting for the price increase mechanism.
   - The cost calculation does not properly reflect the cumulative price increase after purchasing tickets on each day.

2. **Handling of Remaining Tickets**:
   - The code does not correctly handle the case where the number of tickets to be bought is not a multiple of `m`. Specifically, the way it calculates the cost for the remaining tickets after buying `m` tickets on each of the first `q` days is incorrect.
   - The formula `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` is incorrectly used to account for the price increase, and the additional terms added to the cost do not correctly reflect the cumulative price increase.

3. **Simplification Assumption**:
   - The code assumes that buying tickets from the cheapest days first and in chunks of `m` tickets is optimal, which is not necessarily true due to the price increase mechanism. The optimal strategy might involve more complex decisions about when and how many tickets to buy on each day.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not correctly handle edge cases, such as when `k` is very small or when `m` is very large.

Given these issues, the code does not correctly compute the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints.

Correctness: **False**
