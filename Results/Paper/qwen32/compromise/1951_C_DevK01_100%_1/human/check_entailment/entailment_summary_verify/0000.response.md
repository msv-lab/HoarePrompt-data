### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies several critical issues with the provided code. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Sorting and Greedy Approach**:
   - The code sorts the prices and assumes that buying tickets on the cheapest days is the optimal strategy. However, the problem's constraints (prices increasing after each purchase) mean that a greedy approach based solely on sorting is insufficient. The optimal strategy involves considering the cumulative effect of price increases, which the current code does not account for.

2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost calculation in the code is flawed. It does not correctly simulate the scenario where prices increase after each purchase. The formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` does not account for the fact that the prices increase after each purchase, leading to incorrect additional costs.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if `k` is less than `m`, the code might still try to buy `m` tickets on the first day, which is incorrect. Additionally, the code does not handle scenarios where `k` is exactly divisible by `m` or when `k` is not divisible by `m` correctly.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - The provided counterexample demonstrates the incorrectness of the code. The optimal strategy involves a more complex decision-making process that the current code does not implement.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying these issues. The code does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase exactly `k` tickets, given the problem's constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
