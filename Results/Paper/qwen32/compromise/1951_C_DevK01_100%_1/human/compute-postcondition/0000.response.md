Output State: **`t` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.**
