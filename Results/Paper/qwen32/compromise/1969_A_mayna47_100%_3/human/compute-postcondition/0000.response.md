The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the input. The values of `t` and `p` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the input integer; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `p_i` <= n, `p_i` != i for all i in [1, n]**.
