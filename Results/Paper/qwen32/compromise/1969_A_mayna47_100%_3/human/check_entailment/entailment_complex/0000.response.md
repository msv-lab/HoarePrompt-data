### Reasoning:
The given program is designed to determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party. According to the problem statement, a friend `i` will attend the party if both `i` and `p[i]` receive invitations.

The program's logic is as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the number of friends `n`.
   - It reads the list `p` of best friends, where `p[i]` indicates the best friend of friend `i`.
   - It checks if there exists any pair of friends `(i, p[i])` such that `p[p[i]] == i`. This condition indicates that `i` and `p[i]` are best friends of each other.
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` because only 2 invitations are needed (one for `i` and one for `p[i]`).
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3` because at least 3 invitations are required to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party.

The logic seems correct based on the problem description. However, the logic of always printing `3` when no mutual best friend pair is found might not be entirely accurate. There could be cases where fewer than 3 invitations are needed to bring at least 2 friends. For instance, if there are multiple pairs of mutual best friends, sending invitations to just one pair would suffice.

However, the problem statement implies that if no mutual best friend pair is found, at least 3 invitations are required. This is because, in the worst case, Monocarp might need to invite 3 friends to ensure that at least 2 of them, along with their best friends, attend the party.

Given the problem statement and the provided logic, the program should work correctly for the given test cases.
