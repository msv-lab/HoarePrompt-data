The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is an input integer.**
