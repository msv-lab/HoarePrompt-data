Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the number of elements in an array `a`, and `n-1` integers which are the elements of the array `x` (excluding the first element). It processes each test case and returns a result based on the provided input.**
