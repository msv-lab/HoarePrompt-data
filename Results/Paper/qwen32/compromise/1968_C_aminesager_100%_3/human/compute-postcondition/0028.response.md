To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables evolve with each iteration.

Here's the loop for reference:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])
```

After each iteration, the list `a` is updated by appending a new value which is the sum of the last element of `a` and the corresponding element in `T`. This means that after `n-1` iterations (since the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`), the list `a` will have `n` elements.

Let's break down the pattern observed in the first few iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `a = [1000, 1000 + T[0]]`
- After 2 iterations: `a = [1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1]]`
- After 3 iterations: `a = [1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + T[2]]`

Following this pattern, after `n-1` iterations, the list `a` will be:
\[ a = [1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], \ldots, 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + \ldots + T[n-2]] \]

The variable `i` will be `n-1` at the end of the loop, but since the loop condition is `range(1, n)`, `i` will be `n` after the loop completes. The variable `result` will be the space-separated string representation of the list `a`.

So, after all iterations, the output state will be:
- `t` remains `t - 1`
- `n` remains the input integer greater than 1
- `T` remains the list of integers derived from splitting and converting the input string `line`
- `a` will be a list of `n` elements where each element is the cumulative sum starting from 1000 and adding the corresponding elements of `T`
- `i` will be `n`
- `result` will be the space-separated string representation of the list `a`
- `line` remains the input string

In natural language, the final state is that `a` contains `n` elements where each element is a cumulative sum starting from 1000 and adding the corresponding elements of `T`. The variable `i` is equal to `n`, and `result` is the space-separated string of the list `a`.

Output State: **t is t - 1, n is an input integer greater than 1, T is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the input string line, a is a list [1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]], i is n, result is a string that is the space-separated representation of the list a, line is the input string.**
