The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `1` less than `n`. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1;
- `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1;
- `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the input string `line`;
- `a` is a list containing the integers `1000` and `1000 + T[i - 1]`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `1` less than `n`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. The variable `n` does not need to be adjusted as it determines the upper limit of the loop.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `2` if it was `1` in the previous iteration, and so on.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1; `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the input string `line`; `a` is a list containing the integers `1000` and `1000 + T[i - 1]`; `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more precise, if `i` was `1` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `2`.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1; `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the input string `line`; `a` is a list containing the integers `1000` and `1000 + T[i - 1]`; `i` is 2**. 

If `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1; `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the input string `line`; `a` is a list containing the integers `1000` and `1000 + T[i - 1]`; `i` is incremented by 1**.

Given the previous iteration had `i` as `1`, the next state will be:

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1; `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the input string `line`; `a` is a list containing the integers `1000` and `1000 + T[i - 1]`; `i` is 2**.
