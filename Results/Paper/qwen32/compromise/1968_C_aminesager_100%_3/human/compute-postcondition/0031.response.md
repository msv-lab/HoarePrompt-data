The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is truthy (i.e., not zero), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is `t - 1`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be at least 1 before the decrement.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `t` to be at least 1 before the decrement operation. This means `t` should be 2 at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the input string `line`, `a` is a list [1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]], `i` is n, `result` is a space-separated string representation of the list `a`, `line` is the input string**
