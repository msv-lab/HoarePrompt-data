The code appends a new value to the list `a`. This new value is the sum of the last element of `a` (which is `a[i - 1]` or `a[-1]` since `i` is 0 and `a[i - 1]` refers to the last element due to negative indexing in Python) and the last element of `T` (which is `T[i - 1]` or `T[-1]` for the same reason). Given that `a` initially contains only one element `[1000]`, `a[i - 1]` is `1000`. Therefore, the new element to be appended to `a` is `1000 + T[-1]`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the new input string `line`, `a` is a list `[1000, 1000 + T[-1]]`, `i` is 0, `result` is a space-separated string representation of the list `a`, `line` is the new input string**.
