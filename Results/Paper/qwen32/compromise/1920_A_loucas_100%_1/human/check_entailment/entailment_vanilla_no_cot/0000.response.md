Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program logic has an error in how it calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. Specifically, the order of operations and the handling of constraints are not correctly implemented.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. The program calculates `num` as `min(less) - max(big) + 1`. This assumes that all values between `max(big)` and `min(less)` inclusive are valid, but it does not account for the constraints of type 3 (not equal to some integer `x`). This calculation could result in a negative value or an overestimate of the number of valid integers.

2. The program then iterates through the list of constraints of type 3 and decrements `num` for each invalid integer `i` that falls within the range `[max(big), min(less)]`. However, this decrement operation is only performed after the initial calculation of `num`, which might already be incorrect due to the reasons mentioned above.

To fix the program, you should:
- Determine the valid range for `k` using the minimum value from constraints of type 1 (`max(big)`) and the maximum value from constraints of type 2 (`min(less)`).
- Ensure that the range is valid (i.e., `max(big) <= min(less)`). If not, print `0` because no valid `k` exists.
- Subtract the count of invalid integers (from constraints of type 3) that fall within the valid range.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for _ in range(loop):
        less = float('inf')
        big = float('-inf')
        no = set()
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for _ in range(innerLoop):
            a, x = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                big = max(big, x)
            elif a == 2:
                less = min(less, x)
            else:
                no.add(x)
        
        if big > less:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        valid_count = less - big + 1
        invalid_count = sum(1 for i in no if big <= i <= less)
        
        print(valid_count - invalid_count)

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the valid range is calculated correctly and properly accounts for the constraints of type 3.
