You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

    #State: The program has processed all `t` test cases and printed the number of valid integers `k` for each test case based on the given constraints.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of several constraints on an integer `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all the given constraints. Constraints can specify that `k` must be greater than or equal to, less than or equal to, or not equal to certain values.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - Then, it reads each constraint and categorizes them into three lists:
     - `less`: for constraints where `k` must be less than or equal to some value.
     - `big`: for constraints where `k` must be greater than or equal to some value.
     - `no`: for constraints where `k` must not be equal to some value.

2. **Calculating the Range:**
   - The program calculates the range of possible values for `k` by finding the minimum value from the `less` list (`min(less)`) and the maximum value from the `big` list (`max(big)`).
   - The initial count of possible values for `k` is calculated as `num = min(less) - max(big) + 1`.

3. **Handling Constraints of Type 3:**
   - If the calculated range (`num`) is less than 1, it means there are no possible values for `k` that satisfy the constraints of type 1 and 2, so it prints `0` and moves to the next test case.
   - Otherwise, it iterates through the `no` list and subtracts 1 from `num` for each value in `no` that falls within the range `[max(big), min(less)]`.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the number of valid values for `k` after considering all constraints.

### Verification with Example Cases:

Let's verify the program with the example cases provided:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Constraints: `1 3`, `2 10`, `3 1`, `3 5`
   - `less = [10]`, `big = [3]`, `no = [1, 5]`
   - Initial `num = 10 - 3 + 1 = 8`
   - After removing `1` and `5` from the range, `num = 8 - 2 = 6`
   - However, the valid values are `3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10` (7 values), so the program seems correct here.

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Constraints: `1 5`, `2 4`
   - `less = [4]`, `big = [5]`
   - Initial `num = 4 - 5 + 1 = 0`
   - Since `num < 1`, it correctly outputs `0`.

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Constraints: `3 6`, `3 7`, `1 2`, `1 7`, `3 100`, `3 44`, `2 100`, `2 98`, `1 3`, `3 99`
   - `less = [98, 100]`, `big = [2, 3, 7]`, `no = [6, 7, 100, 44, 99]`
   - Initial `num = 98 - 7 + 1 = 92`
   - After removing `7`, `99`, and `100` from the range, `num = 92 - 3 = 89`
   - However, the valid values are `3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, ..., 97, 98` (90 values), so the program seems correct here.

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Constraints: `1 5`, `2 10`, `1 9`, `2 2`, `3 2`, `3 9`
   - `less = [2, 10]`, `big = [5, 9]`, `no = [2, 9]`
   - Initial `num = 2 - 9 + 1 = -6`
   - Since `num < 1`, it correctly outputs `0`.

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - Constraints: `1 1`, `2 2`, `3 1`, `3 2`, `3 3`
   - `less = [2]`, `big = [1]`, `no = [1, 2, 3]`
   - Initial `num = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2`
   - After removing `1` and `2` from the range, `num = 2 - 2 = 0`
   - Correctly outputs `0`.

6. **Sixth Test Case:**
   - Constraints: `1 10000`, `2 900000000`, `3 500000000`, `1 100000000`, `3 10000`, `3 900000001`
   - `less = [900000000]`, `big = [10000, 100000000]`, `no = [500000000, 10000, 900000001]`
   - Initial `num = 900000000 - 100000000 + 1 = 800000001`
   - After removing `10000` from the range, `num = 800000001 - 1 = 800000000`
   - Correctly outputs `800000000`.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis and verification with the example cases, the program appears to be correctly implementing the logic required to solve the problem.
