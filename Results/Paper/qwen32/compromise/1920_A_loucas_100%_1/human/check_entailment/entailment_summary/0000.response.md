### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and verify if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes lists `less`, `big`, and `no` to store constraints of type 2, type 1, and type 3, respectively.

2. **Reading Input**: For each test case, it reads the number of constraints and then iterates through these constraints. Depending on the type of constraint (`a`), it appends the value (`x`) to the corresponding list (`less`, `big`, or `no`).

3. **Calculating Range**: It calculates the potential range of valid `k` values using `min(less) - max(big) + 1`. This formula gives the count of integers from the smallest upper bound (`min(less)`) to the largest lower bound (`max(big)`), inclusive.

4. **Adjusting for Non-Equality Constraints**: If the calculated range (`num`) is positive, the program iterates through the `no` list and decrements `num` for each value in `no` that falls within the range `[max(big), min(less)]`.

5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the adjusted count `num` for each test case. If `num` is negative (which implies an impossible range), it prints `0`.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the first test case from the example:

- **Constraints**: 
  - `1 3` (k ≥ 3)
  - `2 10` (k ≤ 10)
  - `3 1` (k ≠ 1)
  - `3 5` (k ≠ 5)

- **Processing**:
  - `less = [10]`
  - `big = [3]`
  - `no = [1, 5]`
  - Calculated range: `min(less) - max(big) + 1 = 10 - 3 + 1 = 8`
  - Adjustments for non-equality constraints:
    - `1` is not in the range `[3, 10]`, so no change.
    - `5` is in the range `[3, 10]`, so decrement `num` by 1.
  - Final `num = 8 - 1 = 7`

This matches the expected output of `7`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case. It properly accounts for the non-equality constraints and ensures that the output is accurate.

**Correctness: True**
