Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `less` is an empty list, `big` is a list containing the integer `a`, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is 1, `a` is the second integer from the input.**

In natural language: The variable `big` now contains the integer `a`. All other variables retain their initial values.
