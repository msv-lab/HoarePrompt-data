Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `less` contains all `a` where `x` was 2, `big` contains all `a` where `x` was 1, `no` contains at least one element, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `iterable` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `x` was not 1, and `innerLoop` remains unchanged. Additionally, `i` is an integer such that `i` is less than or equal to `min(less)` and `i` is greater than or equal to `max(big)`**
