Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `less` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 2, `big` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 1, `no` contains all integers `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `innerLoop` is the integer value provided by the input.**

In simpler terms, the value of `num` has been updated to be the minimum value in the list `less` minus the maximum value in the list `big` plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
