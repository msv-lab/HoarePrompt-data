The code snippet `no.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. Given the initial state, `no` is a list that contains the integer `a` if the initial `x` was not equal to 1 or 2, otherwise `no` is an empty list. After executing the code, `no` will definitely contain the integer `a`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `less` remains a list containing the integer `a` if the initial `x` was 2, otherwise `less` remains an empty list.
- `big` remains a list containing the integer `a` if the initial `x` was 1, otherwise `big` remains an empty list.
- `no` now contains the integer `a` (regardless of its previous state).
- `num` remains 0.
- `innerLoop` remains greater than 0.
- `x` remains the first integer from the new input.
- `a` remains the second integer from the new input.
- `iterable2` remains `iterable2 + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `less` is a list containing the integer `a` if the initial `x` was 2, otherwise `less` is an empty list, `big` is a list containing the integer `a` if the initial `x` was 1, otherwise `big` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing the integer `a`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `iterable2` is `iterable2 + 1`.**
