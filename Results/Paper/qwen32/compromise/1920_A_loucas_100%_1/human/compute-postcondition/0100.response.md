The only variable in the loop head is `iterable`, so we can only adjust that one. The loop will continue to execute as long as `iterable` is less than `loop`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `iterable` would have taken on the value it had at the end of that iteration. To proceed to the next iteration, `iterable` needs to be incremented by 1.

Here's how the state should be adjusted:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `less` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 2, `big` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 1, `no` contains all integers `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, and `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1` minus the count of elements in `no` that are between `max(big)` and `min(less)` inclusive, `iterable` is incremented by 1**

Since the exact value of `iterable` at the end of the previous iteration isn't specified, we can generalize the adjustment as follows:

If `iterable` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `iterable` should be `k + 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted state, considering only the modification of `iterable`, is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `less` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 2, `big` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 1, `no` contains all integers `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, and `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1` minus the count of elements in `no` that are between `max(big)` and `min(less)` inclusive, `iterable` is `iterable + 1`**
