Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of several constraints on an integer `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all the given constraints. Constraints can specify that `k` must be greater than or equal to, less than or equal to, or not equal to certain values.**
