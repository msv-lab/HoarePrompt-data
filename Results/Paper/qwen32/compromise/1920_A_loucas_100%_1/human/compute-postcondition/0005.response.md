Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; for each test case, there are `n` lines containing two integers `a` and `x` where `a` ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9; `a = 1` indicates k must be greater than or equal to x, `a = 2` indicates k must be less than or equal to x, and `a = 3` indicates k must be not equal to x; `loop` must be greater than 0; `less` is an empty list; `big` is an empty list; `no` is an empty list; `num` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `num` is set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
