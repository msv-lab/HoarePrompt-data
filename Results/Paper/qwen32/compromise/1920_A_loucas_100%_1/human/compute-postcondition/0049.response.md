To determine the output of the `print(num)` statement, let's break down the components involved in calculating `num` based on the given initial state:

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive).
   - `n`: An integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive).
   - `less`: A list containing all `a` values where `x` was 2.
   - `big`: A list containing all `a` values where `x` was 1.
   - `no`: A list containing all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2.
   - `num`: Calculated as `min(less) - max(big) + 1` minus the count of elements in `no` that are between `max(big)` and `min(less)` inclusive.
   - `innerLoop`: The length of the list `no`.

2. **Calculation of `num`:**
   - `min(less)`: The smallest value in the `less` list.
   - `max(big)`: The largest value in the `big` list.
   - `min(less) - max(big) + 1`: This part calculates the number of integers from `max(big)` to `min(less)` inclusive, assuming `min(less) > max(big)`.
   - Subtract the count of elements in `no` that fall within this range `[max(big), min(less)]`.

Given the above, the precise value of `num` depends on the specific values in the lists `less`, `big`, and `no`. Since the exact values of these lists are not provided, we can only describe `num` in terms of these lists.

### Explanation:
- `min(less)`: The minimum value in the `less` list.
- `max(big)`: The maximum value in the `big` list.
- The difference `min(less) - max(big) + 1` gives the count of integers from `max(big)` to `min(less)` inclusive.
- We then subtract the count of elements in `no` that lie within this range.

### Final Output Description:
The `print(num)` statement will output the calculated value of `num` based on the described formula. Since the exact values of the lists `less`, `big`, and `no` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `num`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `num`.

Output: **num (where num is calculated as min(less) - max(big) + 1 minus the count of elements in no that are between max(big) and min(less) inclusive)**
