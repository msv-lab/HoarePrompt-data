Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; for each test case, there are `n` lines containing two integers `a` and `x` where `a` ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9; `a = 1` indicates k must be greater than or equal to x, `a = 2` indicates k must be less than or equal to x, and `a = 3` indicates k must be not equal to x; `loop` must be greater than 0; `less` is an empty list; `big` is an empty list; `no` is an empty list; `num` is 0; `innerLoop` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, there are `n-1` lines remaining containing two integers `a` and `x` where `a` ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `loop` is greater than 0, `less` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x` is 2, `big` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x` is 1, `no` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, there are `n-1` lines remaining containing two integers `a` and `x` where `a` ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `loop` is greater than 0, `less` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x` is 2, `big` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x` is 1, `no` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, `iterable2` is incremented by 1. If `x` is 1, `big` includes the value of `a`. If `x` is 2, `less` includes the value of `a`. Otherwise, `no` includes the value of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, there are `n-1` lines remaining containing two integers `a` and `x` where `a` ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `loop` is greater than 0, `less` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x` is 2, `big` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x` is 1, `no` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the newly read first integer from the input, `a` is the newly read second integer from the input, `iterable2` is incremented by 1. If `x` is 1, `big` includes the newly appended value of `a`. If `x` is 2, `less` includes the newly appended value of `a`. Otherwise, `no` includes the value of `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
