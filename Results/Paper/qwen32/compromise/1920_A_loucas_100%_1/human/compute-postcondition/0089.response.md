The code snippet `num -= 1` decrements the value of `num` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `less` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 2
- `big` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 1
- `no` contains at least one integer
- `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`
- `i` is an integer such that `i <= min(less)` and `i >= max(big)`

After executing `num -= 1`, the new value of `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1 - 1`, which simplifies to `min(less) - max(big)`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `less` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 2, `big` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 1, `no` contains at least one integer, `num` is `min(less) - max(big)`, and `i` is an integer such that `i <= min(less)` and `i >= max(big)`**.
