Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `less` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 2, `big` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 1, `no` is a list containing at least one element, `innerLoop` is the number of iterations the loop ran + 1, and `i` is the next element in the list `no`. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, then `num` is decreased by 1.**
