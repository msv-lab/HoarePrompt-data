Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `less` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 2, `big` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 1, `no` is a list containing at least one element, and `innerLoop` is the number of iterations the loop ran. If `i` is less than or equal to `min(less)` and `i` is greater than or equal to `max(big)`, then `num` is `min(less) - max(big)`. Otherwise, `num` remains `min(less) - max(big) + 1`.**
