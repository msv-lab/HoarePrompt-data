### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to verify if the original assessment is correct.

#### Problem Understanding
The problem requires splitting the array `a` (derived from the string `s` where `+` maps to `1` and `-` to `-1`) into subarrays to minimize the total penalty. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The goal is to find the optimal split that minimizes this total penalty.

#### Program Analysis

The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal solution for the problem. Here is a detailed analysis using the annotated code:

1. **Splitting Strategy**:
   - The program splits the string `s` based on the character `-` and calculates the length of the parts. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty. The optimal split is not necessarily based on the character `-`.

2. **Penalty Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` tries to count the number of times the balance (sum of the subarray) becomes negative and resets it. This does not correctly compute the penalty for each subarray or find the optimal split. The function essentially counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds one if there is a positive balance left. This count does not reflect the actual penalty calculation required.

3. **Optimal Splitting**:
   - The optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty is not addressed in the program. The program does not consider all possible splits and their penalties. An optimal approach would involve either dynamic programming or a greedy strategy that considers the penalty calculation for each possible split.

#### Annotations Analysis
The annotations provide insight into the state of the program before and after the function call:

- **State before function call**: `expression` is a string consisting of characters `+` and `-`, and `length` is a positive integer equal to the length of the string `expression`.
- **State inside function**: The function iterates through the `expression`, updating the `balance` and `count` based on the characters encountered. The balance is reset to zero whenever it goes negative. The final return value is `count + (balance > 0)`, which does not correctly reflect the penalty calculation.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider a dynamic programming or a greedy strategy that optimally splits the array based on the penalty calculation. Here's a brief outline of a correct approach:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - Use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum penalty for the subarray `a[0:i]`.
   - Iterate through the array and for each position `i`, consider all possible subarrays ending at `i` and calculate their penalties.
   - Update the `dp` array with the minimum penalty found.

2. **Greedy Approach**:
   - Traverse the array and keep a running balance.
   - Whenever the balance becomes zero, split the array at that point because the penalty for such a subarray is zero.
   - If the balance does not become zero, continue until the end of the array and calculate the penalty for the remaining subarray.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal solution for the problem. It fails to consider all possible splits and their penalties, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.

### Final Evaluation
Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
