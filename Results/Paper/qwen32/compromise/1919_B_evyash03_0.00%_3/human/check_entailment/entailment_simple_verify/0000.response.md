### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why the provided program is incorrect based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to split the array `a` derived from the string `s` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that their concatenation equals `a`.
- The penalty of a subarray `c` of length `m` is `|c_1 + c_2 + ... + c_m| * m`.
- The goal is to minimize the total penalty `p(b_1) + p(b_2) + ... + p(b_k)`.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Splitting Strategy**:
   - The program splits the string `s` at every `'-'` character and calculates the sum of lengths of the resulting parts.
   - This approach does not align with the problem's requirement to minimize the total penalty. Splitting at every `'-'` does not guarantee an optimal division into subarrays.

2. **Penalty Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates a count based on the balance of `'+'` and `'-'` characters.
   - It increments the count whenever the balance goes negative and adds 1 if the balance is positive at the end.
   - This count does not reflect the actual penalty, which is the absolute value of the sum of a subarray multiplied by its length.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - **Test Case 3**: Input `+-+-+-`
     - The optimal split is `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1])` with a penalty of `0`.
     - The program's approach would not yield this optimal split and instead would output `2` (or `3` as per the original assessment), which is incorrect.

4. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotated code shows the state of the program before and after the function call.
   - The state `expression is "+--++-", length is 6, count is 1, balance is 1` indicates that the function does not correctly calculate the penalty.
   - The function returns `2`, which does not correspond to the minimum penalty for the given input.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array as described in the problem statement. The logic flaw in penalty calculation and incorrect handling of subarrays lead to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
