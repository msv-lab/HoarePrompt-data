In the given task, the for loop iterates over each character in the string `expression`. To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to consider the objects present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `char in expression`, so the only object we can adjust is `expression`.

The loop will execute if and only if the `expression` string has at least one character. Given that `length` is already defined as the length of the string `expression` and it is provided to be a positive integer, we can infer that `expression` is already non-empty. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `expression` to ensure the loop executes.

However, we are also given `count` and `balance` as part of the state, and although they are not directly part of the loop head, the state must be complete. Since `count` and `balance` are initialized to 0 and do not affect the execution of the loop, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

Thus, the state before the loop starts, ensuring the loop can execute, is:

State: **`expression` is a string consisting of characters '+' and '-', and `length` is a positive integer such that `length` equals the length of the string `expression`; `count` is 0; `balance` is 0**
