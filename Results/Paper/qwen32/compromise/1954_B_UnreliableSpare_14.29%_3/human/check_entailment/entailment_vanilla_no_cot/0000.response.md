Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the reasons why:

1. The program first checks if the entire array consists of the same elements. If it does, it correctly prints `-1` because removing elements from such an array will still leave it beautiful.
2. However, the logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful is flawed. The program attempts to find the smallest contiguous subarray of the same elements and then considers the length of this subarray as the answer. This approach is not correct because it does not consider the structure of the array and the operations allowed to make it non-beautiful.

The key issue is that the program does not properly account for the allowed operation and the structure of the array. Specifically, the operation allows us to remove elements in a way that breaks the "beautiful" condition, but the program does not simulate or account for this correctly.

Here is a corrected approach:

1. Check if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same). If so, print `-1`.
2. Otherwise, find the longest contiguous subarray that can be reduced to a single element using the allowed operation. The minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful is the total number of elements minus the length of this longest subarray.

A correct implementation would involve a more sophisticated algorithm to find the longest subarray that can be reduced to a single element using the allowed operation. The current program does not implement this correctly and thus is incorrect.
