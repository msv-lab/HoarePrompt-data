Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem statement to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a "beautiful" array to make it no longer beautiful. A beautiful array is one where you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element with its neighbors if they are equal.

### Program Analysis:
The program provided does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Checking if the array is uniform:** The program first checks if the entire array is uniform (all elements are the same). If it is, it correctly outputs `-1` because a uniform array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

2. **Finding the minimum segment:** The program then tries to find the minimum segment of consecutive elements that are the same. It does this by iterating through the array and updating a counter `cnt` for each segment of the same number. It keeps track of the minimum count of any segment in `ans`.

3. **Incorrect logic:** The logic of finding the minimum segment count and using it as the answer is incorrect. The goal is to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, not to find the smallest segment. The smallest segment might not be the correct answer because removing elements from larger segments might be more effective in making the array non-beautiful.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to analyze the array structure and determine the minimum number of removals required. A correct approach might involve identifying the longest segments of the same number and considering how removing elements from these segments would affect the array's beauty.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis above, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It fails to account for the correct logic needed to determine the minimum number of removals required to make the array non-beautiful.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
