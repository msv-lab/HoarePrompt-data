### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be transformed into an array of identical elements using the specified operation.

The given program attempts to solve this problem by:
1. Checking if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints `-1` because the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.
2. If the array is not uniform, it calculates the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same. This is intended to represent the smallest segment that can be removed to disrupt the beautiful property.

However, the program's logic for calculating `ans` is flawed. It only considers the shortest segment of consecutive elements that are the same before a different element appears. This is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. 

For example, consider the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`. The program would identify the segment `[5]` as the shortest segment of different elements, which is incorrect for this problem. The correct approach would involve more sophisticated analysis to find the optimal segment to remove.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It only considers the shortest segment of consecutive elements that are the same, which is insufficient for solving the problem as described.
