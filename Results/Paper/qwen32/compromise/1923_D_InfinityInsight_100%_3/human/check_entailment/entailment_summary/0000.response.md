Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if it correctly implements the solution.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime, given the rules. If a slime cannot be eaten, it should return -1.

### Code Analysis:

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: This function is supposed to find the index of the first element in the list `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`. If `x` is less than 0, it returns -1.
- **Implementation**: It uses `bisect_left` to find the insertion point for `x` in `a`. If the element at that position is exactly `x`, it returns `inx + 1`; otherwise, it returns `inx`. However, the output hint suggests that the function should return `inx + 1` if `a[inx] == x`, which is correct. The function seems to be working as intended.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: This function calculates the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime. It does this by considering two scenarios: processing the list from left to right and from right to left.
- **Implementation**:
  - `left`: This list accumulates the sum of slime sizes up to each index.
  - `last`: This list keeps track of the last index where the slime size changed.
  - For each slime at index `i`, if it is smaller than the previous one, it can be eaten immediately, so `ans[i] = 1`.
  - Otherwise, it calculates `x` as the sum of sizes up to `i - 1` minus the size of the current slime minus 1.
  - It then uses `func_1` to find the index `inx` where the accumulated sum is at least `x`.
  - It also considers the last index where the size changed (`last[i - 1]`).
  - The function then sets `ans[i]` to the minimum of `i + 1 - inx` and `i + 1 - last[i - 1]` if applicable.

#### Main Loop:
- The main loop processes each test case by calling `func_2` twice: once on the original list and once on the reversed list. It then combines the results to ensure the minimum time for each slime to be eaten is found.

### Correctness Verification:
- The approach of considering both directions (left-to-right and right-to-left) ensures that we find the minimum time for each slime to be eaten, taking into account all possible scenarios.
- The use of `bisect_left` in `func_1` helps efficiently find the necessary indices.
- The logic in `func_2` correctly handles the conditions for a slime to be eaten and calculates the minimum time accordingly.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem. It efficiently calculates the minimum time for each slime to be eaten by considering all possible ways the process can go.

**Correctness: True**
