The code snippet appends a new element to the `left` list. The new element is calculated as the sum of the last element of `left` and the current value of `i`.

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes with at least one element, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n == len(a)` and `n >= 1`; `left` is a list containing the elements `[0, i]`; `ans` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `-1`; `last` is a list where the first element is `-1` and each subsequent element is either the index `i` where `a[i]` is different from `a[i-1]` or the last index of a change if `a[i]` is the same as `a[i-1]`.

After the code `left.append(left[-1] + i)` executes, the `left` list will have one more element, which is the sum of the last element of `left` and the current value of `i`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes with at least one element, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n == len(a)` and `n >= 1`; `left` is a list containing the elements `[0, i, left[-1] + i]`; `ans` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `-1`; `last` is a list where the first element is `-1` and each subsequent element is either the index `i` where `a[i]` is different from `a[i-1]` or the last index of a change if `a[i]` is the same as `a[i-1]`.**

In simpler terms, the `left` list now includes an additional element which is the sum of its last element and the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
