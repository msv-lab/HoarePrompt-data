The code appends the last element of the `last` list to itself. Initially, `last` is `[-1]`, so the last element is `-1`. After appending, `last` becomes `[-1, -1]`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n == len(a)` and `n > 1`; `left` is a list containing the single element `0`; `last` is `[-1, -1]`; `ans` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `-1`. Additionally, `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1]`.**
