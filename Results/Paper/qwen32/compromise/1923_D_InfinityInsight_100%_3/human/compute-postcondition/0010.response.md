The code snippet `last.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the list `last`. Given the initial state, `last` can either be `[-1, i]` or `[-1, -1]` depending on whether `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1]`. After appending `i` to `last`, the new state of `last` will be `[-1, i, i]` if `a[i]` was not equal to `a[i - 1]`, or `[-1, -1, i]` if `a[i]` was equal to `a[i - 1]`.

Since `i` is 2, the `last` list will be updated to either `[-1, 2, 2]` or `[-1, -1, 2]`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n == len(a)` and `n > 1`. `left` is a list containing the single element `0`. `ans` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `-1`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, then `last` is `[-1, i, i]`, otherwise, `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1]` and `last` is `[-1, -1, i]`. `i` is 2.**
