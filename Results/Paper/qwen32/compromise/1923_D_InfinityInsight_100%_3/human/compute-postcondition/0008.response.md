Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n == len(a)` and `n > 1`. `left` is a list containing the single element `0`. `ans` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `-1`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, then `last` is `[-1, i]`. Otherwise, `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1]` and `last` is `[-1, -1]`.**
