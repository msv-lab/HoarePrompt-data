Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is the length of `a` and is greater than 1, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0`, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is `1` and all other elements are `-1`, and `last` is unchanged. The current element `a[i]` is less than the previous element `a[i - 1]`.**

In simpler terms: The `i`-th element of the `ans` list is now set to `1`, while all other elements in `ans` remain `-1`. All other variables (`a`, `n`, `left`, and `last`) remain unchanged.
