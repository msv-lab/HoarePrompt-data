The provided code snippet only includes a single line that calls the function `func_1(left, x)` and assigns its return value to `inx`. Given that `inx` was previously less than `0`, the new value of `inx` will be whatever `func_1(left, x)` returns. Since no other variables are affected by this line, we only need to update `inx` in the output state.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is the length of `a` and is greater than 1, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0`, `last` is unchanged, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is `1` if `a[i] < a[i - 1]`, otherwise the `i`-th element is `i + 1 - inx`, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is the value returned by `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`.**
