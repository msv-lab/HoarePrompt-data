The code appends a new value to the `left` list. The new value is the sum of the last element in the `left` list and the current index `i`. Given that `left` initially contains only the element `0`, the new element in `left` will be `0 + i`, which simplifies to `i`.

Here are the details of the output state:
- `a` remains a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes.
- `n` remains the integer representing the number of slimes such that `n == len(a)` and `n >= 1`.
- `left` now contains two elements: `0` and `i`.
- `ans` remains a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `-1`.
- `last` remains a list where the first element is `-1` and each subsequent element is either the index `i` where `a[i]` is different from `a[i-1]` or the last index of a change if `a[i]` is the same as `a[i-1]`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes with at least one element, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n == len(a)` and `n >= 1`; `left` is a list containing the elements `[0, i]`; `ans` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `-1`; `last` is a list where the first element is `-1` and each subsequent element is either the index `i` where `a[i]` is different from `a[i-1]` or the last index of a change if `a[i]` is the same as `a[i-1]`.**
