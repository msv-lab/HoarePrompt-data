The function accepts a list `a` of integers representing the sizes of slimes and an integer `n` representing the number of slimes such that `n` equals the length of `a` and is at least 1. It returns a list `ans` of `n` elements where each element is `1` if the size of the current slime is less than the size of the previous slime, or `i + 1 - inx` where `inx` is determined by the conditions within the loop.
