Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is at least 2; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list of `n` elements where the first element is `ans % m % MOD` and the second element is also `ans % m % MOD`, and the rest are 0; `ans` is updated based on the value of `s[k]`: if `s[k]` is 'L', `ans` is `(ans // arr[l]) % MOD` and `l` is 1; otherwise, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` except the last element, then divided by `arr[r]` and taken modulo `MOD` and `r` is `n-2`. `c` is 1 in both cases.**
