Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer obtained from the input, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element updated to `ans % m % MOD`, the second element updated to `ans % m % MOD`, and the third element updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `c` is 2, `k` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`.**

In simpler terms, the value at the third position (`res[2]`) of the list `res` is now updated to `ans % m % MOD`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
