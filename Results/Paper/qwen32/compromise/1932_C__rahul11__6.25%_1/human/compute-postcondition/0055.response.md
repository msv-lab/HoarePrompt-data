To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in arr:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over the elements of the list `arr`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `arr` is in a state that allows the loop to execute. Specifically, `arr` must be a list with at least one element for the loop to execute at least once.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **`arr`**: This must be a list with at least one element. If `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute. Therefore, we need to adjust `arr` to ensure it has at least one element.

2. **Other variables**: The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `res`, `ans`, `c`, `l`, `r`) are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this, the adjusted state should ensure that `arr` has at least one element. Here is the final state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element is 0; `ans` is 1; `c` is `n`; `l` is the number of 'L' characters encountered in `s`; `r` is `n-1` minus the number of 'R' characters encountered in `s`**.
