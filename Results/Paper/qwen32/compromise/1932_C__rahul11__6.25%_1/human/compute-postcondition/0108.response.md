The code snippet `ans *= i` multiplies the current value of `ans` by the value of `i`. Given that `ans` is initially `i^2`, after the execution of this line, `ans` will be `i^2 * i`, which simplifies to `i^3`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `arr` is a new list of integers with at least one element; `s` is a list of characters from the new input string; `res` is a list of `n` zeros; `ans` is `i^3`; `c` is `n`; `l` and `r` depend on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`. `i` is the next element in `arr`.**
