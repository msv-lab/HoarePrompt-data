The code snippet `res[c] = ans % m % MOD` modifies the value of `res[c]` based on the current values of `ans`, `m`, and `MOD`. The values of `k` and `ans` from the initial state are not directly affected by this code snippet, as `k` is defined as `i + 1` and `ans` is defined as `ans // arr[r] % MOD`. However, the value of `res[c]` is now set to `ans % m % MOD`.

Output State: **`k` is `i + 1`; `ans` is `ans // arr[r] % MOD`; `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`**.
