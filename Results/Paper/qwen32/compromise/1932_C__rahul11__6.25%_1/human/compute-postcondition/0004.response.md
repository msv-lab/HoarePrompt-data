The code snippet `s = list(input())` reads a string input from the user and converts it into a list of its characters. This affects the variable `s`, but the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the input string.**
