The given code snippet only modifies the variable `ans` by multiplying it with `i`. However, `i` is not defined in the initial state provided. Assuming `i` is a variable that has some value, the new value of `ans` will be `ans * i`. Since the initial value of `ans` is 1, the new value of `ans` will be equal to `i`.

As `i` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `ans`. However, we can express the new state in terms of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list of `n` zeros; `ans` is `i`.**
