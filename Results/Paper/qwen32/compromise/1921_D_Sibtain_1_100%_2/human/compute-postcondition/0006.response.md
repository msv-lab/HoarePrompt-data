The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement has no effect on the variables or the flow of the program. Therefore, none of the variables will be changed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input where all elements are the same; `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input where all elements are the same; the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`.**
