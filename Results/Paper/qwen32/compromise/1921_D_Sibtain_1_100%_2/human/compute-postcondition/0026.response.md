Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, sorted in descending order; `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2`; `i` is 0 if `t2` > `t1` else 1; `j` is 2 if `t2` > `t1` else 1; `k` is incremented by 1; `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`; `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`.**

Explanation: The value of `t2` is updated to be the absolute difference between the `j`-th last element of `a` and the `j`-th last element of `c`. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial state descriptions.
