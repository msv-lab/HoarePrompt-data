In the provided code snippet, the for loop iterates based on the input value `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only involves the variable `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable when the variable itself is not used within the loop body. Therefore, the only variable that can be adjusted in the loop head is `_`, but since it is not used, we need to focus on the value of `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

Given the state before the loop starts, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. This state already ensures that the loop can execute because `t` is guaranteed to be at least 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100**
