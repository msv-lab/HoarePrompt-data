The provided code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. This means that the list `a` will now hold the integers provided in the input, and it will overwrite the previous value of `a`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `c`, `ans`, `k`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences calculated in each iteration; `k` is len(a) - 1; `i` and `j` are values based on the comparisons made during the loop.**
