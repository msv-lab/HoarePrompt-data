Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, sorted in descending order; `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` from the previous calculation plus the maximum of `t1` and `t2` from the current calculation; `i` is 0 if `t2 > t1` else 1; `j` is 4 if `t2 > t1` else 3; `k` is `k + 1`; `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`; `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`.**

In this output state, the only change is that `ans` has been updated by adding the maximum of `t1` and `t2` from the current calculation. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
