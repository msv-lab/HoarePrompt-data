Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input with a length of 1; `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, sorted in descending order. If all elements in `a` are the same and all elements in `c` are the same, and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, then the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, the condition is not satisfied. The current length of `a` is 1.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not affect the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, or `c`, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
