The code snippet provided increments the variable `ans` by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`. Given the initial state, `ans` is initially set to `2 * max(t1, t2)`. Therefore, the new value of `ans` will be `ans + max(t1, t2)`, which is equivalent to `2 * max(t1, t2) + max(t1, t2)`, simplifying to `3 * max(t1, t2)`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `k`, `t1`, `t2`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `ans` is `3 * max(t1, t2)`; `k` is len(a); `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`; `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`. If `t2 > t1`, then `j` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is either 1 or 2.**
