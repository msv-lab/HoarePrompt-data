The code simply increments the value of `j` by 1. Therefore, the value of `j` will change from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `ans` is 0; `k` is len(a) - 1; `i` is 0; `j` is 2; `t1` is abs(a[0] - c[0]); `t2` is abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[0]); and `t2` is greater than `t1`.**
