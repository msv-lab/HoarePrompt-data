To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the variables and their relationships based on the provided initial state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input.
- `a` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the input.
- `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order.
- `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences calculated in each iteration.
- `k` is `len(a) - 1`.
- `i` and `j` are values based on the comparisons made during the loop.
- If all elements in `a` are the same and all elements in `c` are the same and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, the condition is satisfied; otherwise, the condition is not satisfied and no further changes are made to the variables.

### Key Variables in the Print Statement:
- `a[0]`: The first element of the sorted list `a`.
- `max(c)`: The maximum value in the list `c`, which is the first element of `c` because `c` is sorted in descending order.
- `min(c)`: The minimum value in the list `c`, which is the last element of `c` because `c` is sorted in descending order.

### Analysis:
1. **`a[0]`**: Since `a` is a sorted list, `a[0]` is the smallest element in `a`.
2. **`max(c)`**: Because `c` is sorted in descending order, `max(c)` is the first element of `c`.
3. **`min(c)`**: Since `c` is sorted in descending order, `min(c)` is the last element of `c`.

The print statement calculates the maximum absolute difference between `a[0]` and the maximum and minimum values in `c`:
- `abs(a[0] - max(c))`: The absolute difference between the smallest element of `a` and the largest element of `c`.
- `abs(a[0] - min(c))`: The absolute difference between the smallest element of `a` and the smallest element of `c`.

The `print` statement outputs the maximum of these two absolute differences.

### Output:
The output will be the maximum of the absolute differences between the smallest element of `a` and the largest and smallest elements of `c`.

Output: **max(abs(a[0] - c[0]), abs(a[0] - c[-1])) (where a[0] is the smallest element of the sorted list a, c[0] is the largest element of the sorted list c in descending order, and c[-1] is the smallest element of the sorted list c in descending order)**
