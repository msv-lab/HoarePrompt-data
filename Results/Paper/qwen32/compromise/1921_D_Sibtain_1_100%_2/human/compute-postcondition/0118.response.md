Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, each involving two lists of integers `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the differences between elements of the two lists after sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order. The result is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of the sorted lists, considering specific conditions for uniform lists.**
