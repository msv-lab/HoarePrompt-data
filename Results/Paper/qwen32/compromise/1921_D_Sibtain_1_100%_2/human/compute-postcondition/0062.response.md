The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k` and the length of list `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, and it must be less than the length of list `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `ans` is `max(t1, t2)`; `k` is 1; `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`; `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`; If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `j` is 2. Otherwise, `j` is 1 and `i` is 1**
