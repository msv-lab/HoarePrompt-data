The code snippet converts the input string `a` into a list of integers by splitting the string and mapping each split element to an integer. The variables `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The new variable `b` is introduced and holds the list of integers.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `a`.**
