The code snippet converts the input string `a` into a list of integers and assigns it to the variable `b`. The values of `i`, `k`, `t`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is the length of `l` + 1, `k` is the result of decrementing by the counts of elements in `l` as per the loop logic, `t` must be greater than the length of `l` + 1, `a` is an input string, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting `a`.**
