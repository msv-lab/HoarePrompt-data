Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n, f, and k are integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 100.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to an input integer, but the conditions on `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are described for each test case that will follow.
