The `print('MAYBE')` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of the variables `i`, `k`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `o`, `n`, `f`, `fav`, `dic`, or `l`. The string `'MAYBE'` is a literal string that will be printed as is.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement directly contains the string `'MAYBE'`.
2. None of the variables mentioned in the initial state are involved in the `print` statement.
3. Therefore, the output will be the string `'MAYBE'` exactly as specified.

Output: **MAYBE**
