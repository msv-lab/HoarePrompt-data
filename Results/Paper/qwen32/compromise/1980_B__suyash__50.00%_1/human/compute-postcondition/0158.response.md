The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. This output is independent of the values of the variables `i`, `k`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `o`, `n`, `f`, `fav`, `dic`, and `l` described in the initial state.

The `print('NO')` statement directly specifies the string to be printed, and no calculations or evaluations of the other variables are involved in determining this output.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **NO**
