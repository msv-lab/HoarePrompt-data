Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `a`, `o` is a list of substrings from the new input line sorted in descending order, `n` is the first element of `b`, `f` is the second element of `b`, and `k` is the third element of `b` minus the count of occurrences of `l[i]` in `o` if `fav` is not equal to `l[i]`. If `k` is less than or equal to 0 and `fav` is not equal to `l[i]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `fav` is the substring at index `f - 1` of `o`, `dic` is a dictionary where each key is a unique substring in `o` and each value is the count of occurrences of that substring in `o`, and the index of `fav` in `o` is greater than `k - 1` if the condition `o.index(fav) > k - 1` is true. `l` is a list of unique substrings from `o` sorted in descending order and must contain at least one unique substring. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `fav` is equal to `l[i]`.**
