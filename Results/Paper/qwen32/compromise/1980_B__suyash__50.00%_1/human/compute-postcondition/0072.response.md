Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` is greater than the new value of `i`, `a` is a string equal to the user's input, `b` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the string `a`, `o` is a list of substrings from the new user input, `n` is the first element of the list `b`, `f` is the second element of the list `b`, and `k` is the third element of the list `b`. If `k` equals `n`, the condition `k == n` holds true; otherwise, no additional changes are made beyond the initial setup.**
