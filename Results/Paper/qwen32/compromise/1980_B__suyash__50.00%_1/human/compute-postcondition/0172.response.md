Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `k` is `b[2] - dic[l[0]] - dic[l[1]] - dic[l[2]]`, `t` is greater than the length of `l` + 1, `a` is an input string, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting `a`, `o` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user's input and sorted in reverse order, `n` is `b[0]`, `f` is `b[1]`, `fav` is `o[f - 1]`, `dic` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `o` and each value is the count of occurrences of that element in `o`, `l` is a sorted list of unique elements from `o` in reverse order and must have at least 2 elements. If `k` is less than or equal to 0, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
