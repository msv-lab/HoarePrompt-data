Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `a`, `o` is a list of substrings from the new input line, `n` is the first element of `b`, `f` is the second element of `b`, `k` is the third element of `b`. If `k` equals `n`, then `k` is equal to `n`. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables. `fav` is the substring at index `f - 1` of `o`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `fav` has been set to the substring located at index `f - 1` in the list `o`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
