Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `i` is 0.
2. `k` is `b[2] - dic[l[0]]` and `k` is less than or equal to 0.
3. `t` is greater than the length of `l` + 1.
4. `a` is an input string.
5. `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting `a`.
6. `o` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user's input and sorted in reverse order.
7. `n` is `b[0]`.
8. `f` is `b[1]`.
9. `fav` is `o[f - 1]`.
10. `dic` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `o` and each value is the count of occurrences of that element in `o`.
11. `l` is a sorted list of unique elements from `o` in reverse order and must have at least one element.
12. `fav` is not equal to `l[i]`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement `print('NO')` is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or their values. The string `'NO'` is explicitly provided to be printed.

### Output:
The print statement will output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
