t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
