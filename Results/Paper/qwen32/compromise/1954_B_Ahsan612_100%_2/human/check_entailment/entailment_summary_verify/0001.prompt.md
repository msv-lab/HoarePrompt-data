You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program:
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)
        if minn == inf or minn == len(ar):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive equal elements in the list `a`. If all elements in the list are the same or if there is only one element, it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the determined minimum length for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a given beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. A beautiful array is one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a[i]` with `a[i-1]` if `a[i-1] == a[i+1]`. If it's impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements, the answer should be `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `ar` itself. The goal is to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `same` is initialized to 1 to count the length of the current sequence of identical elements.
   - `num` is set to the first element of the array.
   - `minn` is set to infinity to track the minimum length of any sequence of identical elements.

2. **Loop through the array**:
   - The loop iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the current element is the same as `num`, it increments `same`.
   - If the current element is different from `num`, it updates `minn` with the minimum value between `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and updates `num` to the current element.
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 at the end of each iteration.

3. **Final update**:
   - After the loop, `minn` is updated one last time with the minimum value between `minn` and `same`.

4. **Determine the result**:
   - If `minn` is still infinity (which shouldn't happen as it's initialized to `same` at least once) or if `minn` is equal to the length of the array (meaning all elements are the same), the program outputs `-1` because it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful.
   - Otherwise, it outputs `minn`, which represents the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

### Potential Issues:
- The program correctly identifies that if all elements are the same, the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.
- The logic to find the minimum sequence length seems correct as it keeps track of the length of each sequence of identical elements and updates the minimum length.
- However, the program does not correctly handle cases where the array has multiple sequences of identical elements. For example, in the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the program will incorrectly output `1` instead of `3` because it only considers the length of the first sequence it encounters that is not the entire array.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not always provide the correct minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
