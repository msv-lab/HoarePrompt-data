To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is just `i` and the length of `ar`.

### Analysis:
- The loop condition is `while i < len(ar)`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is increased by 1.
- The length of `ar` is given to be greater than 3.

### Steps to Ensure the Loop Can Execute One More Time:
1. **Ensure `i` is less than `len(ar)`**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to make sure that the new value of `i` is still less than `len(ar)`.
2. **Adjust `i` and `len(ar)` if necessary**: If `i` is already equal to or greater than `len(ar)`, we need to adjust `i` to be less than `len(ar)` or adjust `len(ar)` to be greater than `i`.

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 3.
- `i` is increased by 1 at the end of the previous iteration.

### Conclusion:
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure `i` is less than `len(ar)`.
- Since `ar` is given to have a length greater than 3, and `i` is incremented by 1, we can ensure that `i` remains less than `len(ar)` by simply not changing `i` and `len(ar)` if `i` is still less than `len(ar)` after the increment.

### Final State:
- If `i` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `len(ar)`, no adjustment is needed.
- If `i` is incremented by 1 and is equal to `len(ar)`, we need to adjust `len(ar)` to be greater than `i`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `i` after the increment, we assume it is still less than `len(ar)` to proceed with the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 3; `i` is increased by 1, and `i` is still less than `len(ar)`**
