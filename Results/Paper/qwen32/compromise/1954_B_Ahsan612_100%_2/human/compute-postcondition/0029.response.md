The code snippet provided is:

```python
minn = min(minn, same)
```

This line updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 3
- `i` is increased by 1, and `i` is still less than `len(ar)`
- `num` is `ar[i]`

The only change is to the variable `minn`. The new value of `minn` will be the minimum of its previous value and the value of `same`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 3; `i` is increased by 1, and `i` is still less than `len(ar)`; `num` is `ar[i]`; `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and `same`.**
