The code snippet `same += 1` increments the value of the variable `same` by 1. Given the initial state, the value of `same` is either 2 or 1. After the increment, if `same` was initially 2, it becomes 3, and if `same` was initially 1, it becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer and `n` must be greater than 3; `ar` is a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]` with `n > 1`. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 2, `same` is 3, and `minn` is `inf`. Otherwise, `i` is 3, `same` is 2, `num` is `ar[2]`, and `minn` is 1.**
