The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`) remain unchanged. Since `i` was initially less than `len(ar)`, after incrementing, `i` is still less than `len(ar)`, assuming the increment does not make `i` equal to `len(ar)` in this step.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 3; `i` is increased by 1, and `i` is still less than `len(ar)`**.
