The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` is either 2 or 3, after the increment, `i` will be either 3 or 4. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 (after decrementing by 1); `ar` is a new list of integers with length greater than 1; `n` must be greater than `i`; `i` is either 3 or 4; if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2; otherwise, `i` is 2, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1, and `num` is `ar[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 (after decrementing by 1); `ar` is a new list of integers with length greater than 1; `n` must be greater than `i`; `i` is either 3 or 4; if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2; otherwise, `i` is 2, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1, and `num` is `ar[2]`.**
