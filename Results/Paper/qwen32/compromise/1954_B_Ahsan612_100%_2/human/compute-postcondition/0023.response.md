Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 3; if `ar[3]` equals `num`, then `i` remains 3 and `same` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `i` is updated to 4, `num` is set to `ar[4]`, `minn` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `same`, and `same` is reset to 1.**
