The code snippet `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. Given the initial state, `minn` is `inf` and `same` is `1`. Therefore, `minn` will be updated to `1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 (after decrementing by 1); `ar` is a new list of integers with length greater than 1; `n` is the length of the new `ar` list; `i` is 2; `minn` is 1; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[2]`; `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.**
