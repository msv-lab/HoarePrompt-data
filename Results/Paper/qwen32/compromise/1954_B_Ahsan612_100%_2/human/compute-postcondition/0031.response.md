Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 3; `i` is increased by 1, and `i` is still less than `len(ar)`. If `ar[i]` was equal to `num`, `same` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `num` is updated to `ar[i]`, `minn` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `same`, and `same` is reset to 1.**
