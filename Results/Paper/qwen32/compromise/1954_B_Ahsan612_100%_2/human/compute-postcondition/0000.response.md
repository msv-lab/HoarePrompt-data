For the given task, we need to analyze the for loop and determine the states that need to be adjusted. The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that is not used within the loop body. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`.

Given that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and it represents the number of test cases, the loop will execute `t` times. Therefore, the input to the `range` function must be `t`.

Since the loop variable `_` is not used, we do not need to adjust its state. The only state that needs to be adjusted is the input to the `range` function, which should be `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
