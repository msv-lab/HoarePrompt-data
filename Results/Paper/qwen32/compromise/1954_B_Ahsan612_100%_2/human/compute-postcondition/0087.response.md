To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the loop condition `i < len(ar)`. The variables `i` and `ar` are the only ones that can be adjusted based on the loop head.

Given:
- `i` is 1.
- `ar` is a new list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]`.
- `n` is the length of the new `ar` list.

The loop condition `i < len(ar)` must be true for the loop to execute. Since `i` is already 1, `len(ar)` must be greater than 1 for the condition to hold true.

Therefore, the state of `ar` must be adjusted to ensure that its length is greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 (after decrementing by 1); `ar` is a new list of integers with length greater than 1; `n` is the length of the new `ar` list; `i` is 1; `minn` is undefined or recalculated based on the new `ar` list; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[0]`; `minn` is `inf`.**
