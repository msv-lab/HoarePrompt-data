The loop head in the provided code snippet is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This implies that the loop iterates a number of times specified by the input integer, and the loop variable `_` is not used within the loop body.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is the input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]`
- `i` is `n`
- `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `ar[n-1]` at the end of the list
- `num` is `ar[n-1]`
- `minn` is the minimum of its original value and `same`. If `minn` is `inf` or `minn` is equal to the length of `ar`, the condition holds as specified in the if part. Otherwise, `minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`.

Since the loop head only involves the input integer `t` (which determines the number of iterations) and the loop variable `_` (which is not used), we only need to adjust `t` for the next iteration. Specifically, `t` should be decremented by 1 to reflect the next iteration of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 (after decrementing by 1), `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]`, `i` is `n`, `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `ar[n-1]` at the end of the list, `num` is `ar[n-1]`, `minn` is the minimum of its original value and `same`. If `minn` is `inf` or `minn` is equal to the length of `ar`, the condition holds as specified in the if part. Otherwise, `minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`.**
