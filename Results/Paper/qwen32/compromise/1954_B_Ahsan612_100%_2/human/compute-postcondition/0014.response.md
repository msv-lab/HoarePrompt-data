The code snippet provided is simply `same = 1`, which reassigns the variable `same` to the value 1. This does not affect any other variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 1; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[i]`; `minn` is 1; `i` is 2; `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `same` is set to 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
