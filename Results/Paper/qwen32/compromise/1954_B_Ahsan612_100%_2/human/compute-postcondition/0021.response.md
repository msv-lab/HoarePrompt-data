The given code snippet is `minn = min(minn, same)`. This line of code updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the current value of `minn` or `same`. Therefore, we can only express the output state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 3; `i` is 4; `num` is `ar[4]`; `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and `same`.**
