Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]`; `i` is `n`; `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `ar[n-1]` at the end of the list; `num` is `ar[n-1]`; `minn` is the minimum of its original value and `same`; `minn` is neither equal to `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`**
