The code snippet provided resets the variable `same` to 1. This means that the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are equal is now 1. 

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `num`, `minn`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]`; `i` is equal to the length of `ar`; `same` is 1; `num` is the value of the last element in the list `ar` or the value of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are equal; `minn` is the minimum count of any sequence of consecutive elements that are equal encountered during the loop. If `minn` was initially `inf` or equal to the length of `ar`, it retains its value. Otherwise, `minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`.**
