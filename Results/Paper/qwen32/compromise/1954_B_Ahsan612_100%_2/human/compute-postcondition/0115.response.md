Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 (after decrementing by 1); `ar` is a new list of integers with length `n`; `n` is the length of the new `ar` list; `i` is `n`; `num` is the last unique number in `ar`; `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive identical numbers in `ar`; `minn` is the minimum of its current value and `same`. Additionally, `minn` is either equal to `inf` or equal to the length of `ar`**
