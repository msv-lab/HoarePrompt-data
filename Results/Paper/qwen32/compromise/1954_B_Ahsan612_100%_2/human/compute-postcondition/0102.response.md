The code snippet `same = 1` directly assigns the value `1` to the variable `same`. This change affects the previous state where `same` could be either `1` or `2` based on the condition `if ar[i] == num`. After the assignment, `same` is definitely `1`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 (after decrementing by 1); `ar` is a new list of integers with length greater than 1; `n` must be greater than `i`; `i` is either 3 or 4; `num` is `ar[i]` if `i` is 3 or 4, otherwise `ar[2]`; `same` is 1; `minn` is 1.**
