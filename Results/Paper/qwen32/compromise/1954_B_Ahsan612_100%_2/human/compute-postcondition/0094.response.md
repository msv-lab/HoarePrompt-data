Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 (after decrementing by 1); `ar` is a new list of integers with length greater than 1; `n` is the length of the new `ar` list; `i` is 2; `minn` is 1; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[2]`; `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `same` has been reset to 1. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
