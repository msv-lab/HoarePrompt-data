The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs `-1`. The initial state description provides details about several variables (`t`, `ar`, `n`, `i`, `num`, `same`, `minn`), but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of these variables.

Let's break down the given information and the task:

- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4\) (after decrementing by 1).
- `ar` is a new list of integers with length `n`.
- `n` is the length of the new `ar` list.
- `i` is `n`.
- `num` is the last unique number in `ar`.
- `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive identical numbers in `ar`.
- `minn` is the minimum of its current value and `same`. Additionally, `minn` is either equal to `inf` or equal to the length of `ar`.

Given this information, none of these variables are referenced in the `print(-1)` statement. Therefore, the output will simply be `-1`.

Output: **-1**
