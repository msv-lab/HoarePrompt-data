The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s`, which is a binary string consisting of only '0's and '1's, and `n`, which is a non-negative integer representing the number of '1's encountered in the string `s` up to the current index `i`. The function returns the value of `n` after processing the string `s`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n` representing the count of '1's in `s` up to a certain index. It returns the count of '1's in the string `s`.**
