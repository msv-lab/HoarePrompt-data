Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using the described operations. The logic in `func_1` is incorrect for determining the minimum cost. Let's analyze why:

The program counts the number of '1's encountered and adds `n + 1` to the answer whenever it encounters a '0' after seeing at least one '1'. This approach does not account for the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts to sort the string.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as counting the inversions or transitions from '1' to '0' and calculating the cost based on those transitions. A correct approach might involve identifying the segments of the string that need to be shifted and calculating the cost of those shifts efficiently.

Here is a brief outline of a correct approach:
1. Traverse the string and identify segments of '1's and '0's.
2. Calculate the cost of shifting segments to sort the string.
3. Sum the costs for all necessary shifts.

The provided program does not follow this logic and thus is incorrect.
