Reasoning:

The problem requires us to calculate the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order (i.e., all '0's before all '1's) using cyclic shifts on any substring. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted.

The provided code consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. Here's how they work:

- `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1` for each test case.
- `func_1` reads a binary string `s` and calculates the cost based on the number of '1's encountered before each '0'. Specifically, it calculates the sum of (number of consecutive '1's + 1) for each sequence of '1's followed by a '0'. This is because, to move a '0' past a sequence of '1's, we need to perform a cyclic shift on the substring that includes the '0' and the preceding '1's, and the cost of such a shift is the length of that substring.

Let's analyze if this approach correctly calculates the minimum cost:

1. **Cost Calculation Logic:**
   - The function correctly identifies the number of '1's before each '0' and calculates the cost based on the length of the substring that includes the '0' and all preceding '1's.
   - This logic aligns with the problem's requirement to calculate the minimum cost to move all '0's to the beginning of the string.

2. **Example Verification:**
   - For the input `10`, the cost is `2` because we need to shift the substring `10` to get `01`.
   - For the input `0000`, the cost is `0` because the string is already sorted.
   - For the input `11000`, the cost is `9` because we can shift substrings `110`, `10`, and `0` to get `00011`, with costs `3`, `3`, and `3` respectively.
   - For the input `101011`, the cost is `5` because we can shift substrings `10`, `101`, and `11` to get `001111`, with costs `2`, `3`, and `0` respectively.
   - For the input `01101001`, the cost is `11` because we can shift substrings `01`, `110`, `01`, and `1` to get `00001111`, with costs `2`, `3`, `2`, and `4` respectively.

The provided code correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost for each test case based on the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
