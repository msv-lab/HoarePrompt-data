### Reasoning:

The given program reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of the number of coins `n` and a string `s` representing the state of each coin (either facing up 'U' or down 'D'). The program determines the winner of the game based on the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`).

The core logic of the program lies in `func_2`, which checks if the number of facing-up coins (`ups`) is odd or even. If the number of `'U'` characters is odd, the program returns `'YES'`, indicating that Alice will win the game. If the number of `'U'` characters is even, it returns `'NO'`, indicating that Bob will win the game.

To understand why this works, consider the game mechanics:
- Each move removes one `'U'` and flips the adjacent coins.
- If the number of `'U'` coins is odd, the player who starts (Alice) can always make a move that leaves an even number of `'U'` coins for the opponent.
- Conversely, if the number of `'U'` coins is even, the player who starts will eventually face a situation where they cannot make a move (when the number of `'U'` coins becomes odd), and the opponent will win.

Thus, the parity of the number of `'U'` coins determines the winner, and the program correctly implements this logic.
