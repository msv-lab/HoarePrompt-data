Reasoning:
The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the initial configuration of coins. The game involves flipping adjacent coins when a facing-up coin is removed, and the player who cannot make a move loses. The solution hinges on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins ('U') in the initial configuration. If the number of 'U' coins is odd, Alice wins; if it is even, Bob wins.

The provided program consists of two functions:
- `func_1` reads multiple test cases from the input and returns a list of tuples, each containing the number of coins and the corresponding string of 'U' and 'D' characters.
- `func_2` takes a tuple as input, counts the number of 'U' characters, and returns 'YES' if the count is odd (indicating Alice wins) and 'NO' if the count is even (indicating Bob wins).

The logic in `func_2` directly correlates with the problem's rules: the parity of the number of 'U' coins determines the winner. Therefore, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
