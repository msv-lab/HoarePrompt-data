To determine the output state after the loop executes all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given initial state and the code inside the loop.

The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the initial input integer. For each iteration, the loop:
1. Takes an integer `n` as input.
2. Checks if `n` is odd. If it is, it prints 'NO'.
3. If `n` is even, it creates a string `s` consisting of the pattern 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.
4. Checks if the length of `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The variables `t` and `n` are the only ones that are relevant to the loop's behavior. The variable `t` determines the number of iterations, and `n` is redefined in each iteration based on the input. The variable `s` is only defined and used within the loop and does not persist after the loop ends.

Since the loop modifies `n` in each iteration and `s` is only relevant within each iteration, the final state of `n` after the loop will be the value of `n` from the last iteration. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it controls the number of iterations.

Output State: **`t` is the same as the initial input integer; `n` is the integer input in the last iteration of the loop.**
