You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` checks if a given password meets specific criteria: it must contain lowercase Latin letters and digits only, the letters must be in alphabetical order, the digits must be in ascending order, and no letter can be immediately followed by a digit. If any of these conditions are not met, the function returns 'NO'; otherwise, it returns 'YES'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all the conditions specified in the problem description. Specifically, it does not correctly handle the case where the password consists only of digits or only of letters. The function `func_1` separates the letters and digits into two lists, sorts them, and checks if they are sorted individually. However, it does not ensure that the digits come after all the letters in the password, which is a requirement.

Let's consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
```
2
3
abc
3
123
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
YES
YES
```

The program will correctly identify these passwords as "YES" because they are sorted and do not have digits following letters. However, let's consider another test case:

**Test Case:**
```
2
4
ab12
4
12ab
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
NO
```

**Actual Output:**
```
YES
YES
```

In the second test case, the password "12ab" should return "NO" because the digits are not following all the letters. The program does not correctly handle this scenario.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not ensure that all digits come after all letters in the password.
