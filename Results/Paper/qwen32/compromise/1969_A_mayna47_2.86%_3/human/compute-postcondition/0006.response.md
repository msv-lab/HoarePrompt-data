The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, but since the range starts from 1 to `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute. However, we are given that `n` is an input integer such that `2 <= n <= 50` and `n` is not equal to 2, meaning `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute.

The variable `i` is the loop iterator and will be initialized to 1 at the start of the loop, so we do not need to adjust it before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is at least 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` != `i`; `v` is a list where the first element is 0 and the next `n` elements are the integers read from the input.**
