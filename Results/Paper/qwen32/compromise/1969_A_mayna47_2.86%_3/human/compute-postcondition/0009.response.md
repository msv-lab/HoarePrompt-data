Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` != `i`; `v` is a list where the first element is 0 and the next `n` elements are the integers read from the input. If `n` is 2, the specific conditions for `n` being 2 are met. Otherwise, the loop has completed all iterations without printing 2.**
