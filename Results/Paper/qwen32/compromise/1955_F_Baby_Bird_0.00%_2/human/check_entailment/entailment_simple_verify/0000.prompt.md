You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of four integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) (0 \(\le\) \( p_i \) \(\le\) 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively. There are \( t \) (1 \(\le\) \( t \) \(\le\) 10^4) such test cases.
def func():

        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem description.

The problem description states that Eve removes numbers optimally to maximize the number of times Bob wins. Bob wins when the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. The XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the count of numbers with each bit set to 1 is even.

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by first reducing each count of numbers (p_i) to the nearest even number, then checking if all counts of ones, twos, and threes are odd, and finally adding the total count of numbers divided by 2.

However, the logic in the program is flawed. Here's why:

1. The program reduces each count to the nearest even number using `list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))`. This step is unnecessary and incorrect. The optimal strategy involves keeping track of the parity (odd or even) of the counts, not their even values.
2. The condition `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` checks if all counts of ones, twos, and threes are odd. This is one of the conditions for Bob to win, but it does not cover all scenarios.
3. The program adds `sum(p) // 2` to the result, which does not correctly represent the number of times Bob can win. This part of the logic is incorrect and does not align with the problem requirements.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness:

Input:
```
1
1 2 3 4
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

Explanation of the expected output:
- Initially, the counts are 1 (ones), 2 (twos), 3 (threes), and 4 (fours).
- Eve can remove one 'one', making the counts 0 (ones), 2 (twos), 3 (threes), and 4 (fours). XOR is non-zero.
- Eve can remove one 'three', making the counts 0 (ones), 2 (twos), 2 (threes), and 4 (fours). XOR is zero (Bob wins).
- Eve can remove one 'two', making the counts 0 (ones), 1 (twos), 2 (threes), and 4 (fours). XOR is non-zero.
- Eve can remove one 'two', making the counts 0 (ones), 0 (twos), 2 (threes), and 4 (fours). XOR is zero (Bob wins).
- Eve can remove one 'three', making the counts 0 (ones), 0 (twos), 1 (threes), and 4 (fours). XOR is non-zero.
- Eve can remove one 'three', making the counts 0 (ones), 0 (twos), 0 (threes), and 4 (fours). XOR is zero (Bob wins).
- Eve can remove all 'fours', making the counts 0 (ones), 0 (twos), 0 (threes), and 0 (fours). XOR is zero (Bob wins).

Thus, Bob can win 3 times in this case.

However, the provided program would not produce the correct result for this input, making it incorrect.

Therefore, the Correctness is **False**.
