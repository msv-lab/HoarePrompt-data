You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order. The number of test cases t is between 1 and 500 inclusive.
def func():

        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)
        
    #State: a series of t outputs, each being either -1 or a calculated result based on the scores of the three players.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to carefully analyze the logic and verify if it correctly computes the maximum number of draws based on the given constraints.

### Reasoning:

1. **Total Points Check**:
   - The sum of the scores `p1 + p2 + p3` must be even because each game either results in a total of 2 points (one player wins) or 2 points (both players draw).
   - If the total points are odd, it's impossible to have a valid set of games, so the program correctly prints `-1`.

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(p1 + p2 + p3) - \max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)}{2}
     \]
   - Let's break this down:
     - `p1 + p2 + p3` is the total points scored by all three players.
     - `max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)` is the minimum points that `p3` must have scored if `p1` and `p2` did not contribute any points to `p3` (i.e., all points `p3` has are due to wins against `p1` and `p2`).
     - Subtracting this from the total points gives us the points that could be attributed to draws.
     - Dividing by 2 gives the number of draws because each draw contributes 2 points.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **No Games Played** (`p1 = p2 = p3 = 0`): The total points are 0, so the number of draws is 0, which is correct.
   - **All Draws** (`p1 = p2 = p3`): The total points are evenly distributed, and the formula correctly calculates the number of draws.
   - **Impossible Scores** (like `p1 = 1, p2 = 1, p3 = 1`): The total points are odd, so the program correctly prints `-1`.

4. **Validation Against Examples**:
   - **Example 1**: `0 0 0` → Total points = 0, even → Draws = 0.
   - **Example 2**: `0 1 1` → Total points = 2, even → Draws = 1.
   - **Example 3**: `1 1 1` → Total points = 3, odd → `-1`.
   - **Example 4**: `1 1 2` → Total points = 4, even → Draws = 2.
   - **Example 5**: `3 3 3` → Total points = 9, odd → `-1`.
   - **Example 6**: `3 4 5` → Total points = 12, even → Draws = 6.
   - **Example 7**: `1 1 10` → Total points = 12, even → Draws = 2.

The program correctly handles all these cases, ensuring that the maximum number of draws is calculated accurately and that impossible scores are correctly identified.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or identify impossible scores based on the provided constraints.
