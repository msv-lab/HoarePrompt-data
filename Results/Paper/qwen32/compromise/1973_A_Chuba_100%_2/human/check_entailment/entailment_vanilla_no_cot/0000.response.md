To determine the correctness of the program, we need to analyze whether it correctly calculates the maximum number of draws based on the given scores \( p_1, p_2, \) and \( p_3 \).

### Analyzing the Program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads three integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3 \) representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Score Validation:**
   - The program first checks if the total score \((p_1 + p_2 + p_3)\) is odd. If it is, the program immediately prints `-1` because the total score must be even (each game awards a total of 2 points, either 2 to the winner and 0 to the loser, or 1 to each in the case of a draw).

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - If the total score is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(p_1 + p_2 + p_3) - \max(0, p_2 - p_0 - p_1)}{2}
     \]
   - This formula attempts to maximize the number of draws by minimizing the number of games that had a clear winner.

### Verifying the Formula:

To verify the correctness of the formula, let's consider the following:

- **Total Points and Draws:**
  - Each game contributes 2 points to the total score.
  - Each draw contributes 2 points to the total score.
  - Each win/loss game contributes 2 points to the total score.
  
- **Constraints on Scores:**
  - The scores are non-negative and sorted such that \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).

- **Key Insight:**
  - The formula tries to determine the minimum number of games that were won/lost by considering the difference \( p_2 - p_0 - p_1 \).
  - If \( p_2 - p_0 - p_1 \) is positive, it suggests that some games had a clear winner, and the remaining games could be draws.
  - If \( p_2 - p_0 - p_1 \) is non-positive, it suggests that all games could potentially be draws.

### Testing the Program:

Let's test the program with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `0 0 0`
   - Total score: `0` (even)
   - Formula: \(\frac{0 - \max(0, 0 - 0 - 0)}{2} = 0\)
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `0 1 1`
   - Total score: `2` (even)
   - Formula: \(\frac{2 - \max(0, 1 - 0 - 0)}{2} = 1\)
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `1 1 1`
   - Total score: `3` (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `1 1 2`
   - Total score: `4` (even)
   - Formula: \(\frac{4 - \max(0, 1 - 1 - 1)}{2} = 2\)
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Example 5:**
   - Input: `3 3 3`
   - Total score: `9` (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

6. **Example 6:**
   - Input: `3 4 5`
   - Total score: `12` (even)
   - Formula: \(\frac{12 - \max(0, 4 - 3 - 3)}{2} = 6\)
   - Output: `6` (Correct)

7. **Example 7:**
   - Input: `1 1 10`
   - Total score: `12` (even)
   - Formula: \(\frac{12 - \max(0, 1 - 1 - 1)}{2} = 2\)
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the given examples and follows a logical approach to determine the maximum number of draws or identify invalid score configurations. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
