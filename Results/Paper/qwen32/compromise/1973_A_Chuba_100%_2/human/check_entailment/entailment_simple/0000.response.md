### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred given the scores of three players after a series of chess games. The key points to consider are:

1. **Score Validation**: The total points among the three players must be even because each game either results in 2 points (one player wins, the other loses) or 2 points (both players draw).

2. **Draw Calculation**: If the total points are even, the maximum number of draws can be calculated by considering the difference between the scores. The formula used in the program:
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2}
   \]
   - \(v[0] + v[1] + v[2]\) is the total points.
   - \(\max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])\) adjusts the total points to account for the maximum possible non-draw points (i.e., wins/losses).

3. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases such as:
   - All scores being zero.
   - Scores that cannot be achieved by any combination of wins, losses, and draws.

Let's analyze the given example outputs to validate the reasoning:

- **Input:** `0 0 0`
  - Total points: 0 (even)
  - No games were played, so no draws.
  - **Output:** `0` (Correct)

- **Input:** `0 1 1`
  - Total points: 2 (even)
  - One draw is possible between the second and third players.
  - **Output:** `1` (Correct)

- **Input:** `1 1 1`
  - Total points: 3 (odd)
  - Scores cannot be achieved.
  - **Output:** `-1` (Correct)

- **Input:** `1 1 2`
  - Total points: 4 (even)
  - Two draws are possible.
  - **Output:** `2` (Correct)

- **Input:** `3 3 3`
  - Total points: 9 (odd)
  - Scores cannot be achieved.
  - **Output:** `-1` (Correct)

- **Input:** `3 4 5`
  - Total points: 12 (even)
  - Six draws are possible.
  - **Output:** `6` (Correct)

- **Input:** `1 1 10`
  - Total points: 12 (even)
  - Two draws are possible.
  - **Output:** `2` (Correct)

The program correctly handles all these cases and adheres to the logic required to solve the problem.
