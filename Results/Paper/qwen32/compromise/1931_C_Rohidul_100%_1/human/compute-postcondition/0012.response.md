To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that both conditions in the `while` loop statement are satisfied:

1. `l < r`
2. `a[l] == a[l + 1]`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `l` is increased by 2.
- `r` must be greater than `l + 1`.
- `a[l]` must be equal to `a[l + 1]`.
- `st` is increased by 1.

### Analysis:
- The first condition `l < r` needs to be satisfied. Since `r` must be greater than `l + 1`, and `l` has increased by 2, `r` must be adjusted to be greater than the new `l + 1`.
- The second condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]` must also be satisfied. Since `a[l]` must be equal to `a[l + 1]`, no adjustment is needed for the array elements themselves, but we need to ensure that the index `l` is such that this condition holds true.

### Adjustments:
- Since `l` has increased by 2, to ensure `l < r`, `r` must be greater than `l + 1`. If `l` is now at position `l_new`, then `r` must be greater than `l_new + 1`.
- The condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]` must hold true, so no further adjustment is required for the array elements as long as this condition is met at the new `l`.

### Final State:
State: **`l` is increased by 2, `r` must be greater than `l + 1`, `a[l]` must be equal to `a[l + 1]`**.
