To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head: `l`, `r`, and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`.

Here's the given loop condition:
```python
while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **`l < r`**: This condition requires that `l` is less than `r`. At the end of the previous iteration, `r` must be at least 2 and `l` is 2. To ensure `l < r`, `r` must be greater than 2.
2. **`a[l] == a[l + 1]`**: This condition requires that the elements at positions `l` and `l + 1` in the list `a` are equal. At the end of the previous iteration, `a[0]` is equal to `a[1]` and `a[1]` is equal to `a[2]`. Since `l` is 2, we need to ensure `a[2] == a[3]` for the loop to execute again.

### Conclusion:
- `r` must be greater than 2 to satisfy `l < r`.
- `a[2]` must be equal to `a[3]` to satisfy `a[l] == a[l + 1]`.

No other states need to be adjusted as per the requirement to only adjust the states of objects in the loop head.

### Final State:
State: **`r` must be greater than 2, `end` is 1, `ans` is calculated based on the conditions given, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` is equal to `a[1]`, `a[1]` is equal to `a[2]`, and `a[2]` is equal to `a[3]`, `le` is the length of `a`, `l` is 2, `st` is 3**
