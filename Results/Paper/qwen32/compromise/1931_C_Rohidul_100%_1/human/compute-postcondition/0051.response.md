The code snippet provided is `r -= 1`, which decrements the value of `r` by 1. Given the initial state, `r` is initially `n - 1`. After decrementing, `r` becomes `n - 2`.

The other variables (`end`, `ans`, `n`, `a`, `le`, `l`, `st`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is `n - 2`, `end` is `2`, `ans` is calculated based on the conditions given, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers such that `a[n] == a[n - 1]`, `le` is the length of `a` and `le` must be at least `n + 1`, `l` is `n - 2`, `st` is `n`**.
