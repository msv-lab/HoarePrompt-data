The code snippet updates the value of `ans` based on the new formula `max(0, le - (st + end))`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `r` is `l`
- `end` is incremented by 1
- `ans` is `le - max(st, end + 1)`
- `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`

After the code execution, `ans` is updated to `max(0, le - (st + end))`.

Output State: **`r` is `l`, `end` is incremented by 1, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`, `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`**.
