The code snippet initializes two variables `l` and `r` with the values `0` and `n - 1`, respectively. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `le` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value input by the user, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`.**
