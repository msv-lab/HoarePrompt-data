Output State: **`l` is the index where `a[l] != a[l + 1]` or `l == r - 1`, `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from index 0, `r` is `l`, `a[r] == a[r - 1]`, `end` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `end` is incremented by 1. All other variables (`l`, `st`, `r`, and the condition `a[r] == a[r - 1]`) remain unchanged.
