Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program is too simplistic and does not account for the optimal way to make all elements of the array equal with the given operation.

Here are some issues with the logic:
1. The program only checks the longest streak of equal elements from the beginning and the end of the array.
2. It does not consider other potential segments within the array that might be more cost-effective to change.
3. The program does not handle cases where the optimal solution involves changing a segment that is neither at the beginning nor the end of the array.

For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The program would incorrectly output `3` (since it would consider the longest streaks from the ends, which are both of length 1), but the correct answer is `2` (by changing the middle `2` and the last `1` to `1`).

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, possibly involving dynamic programming or other optimization techniques to find the minimum cost to make all elements equal.
