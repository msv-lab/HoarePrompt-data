Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and the provided function summary to ensure the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons on a 5x3 grid (15 cells total).
- We need to determine the minimum number of screens required to accommodate all icons.

### Program Analysis:
The program provided is as follows:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b
        if t % 2 == 0:
            t = t // 2
        else:
            t = t // 2 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)
```

### Function Summary:
The function reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons. It calculates the number of screens required to place these icons.

### Detailed Evaluation:
1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `a` (1x1 icons) and `b` (2x2 icons).

2. **Handling 2x2 Icons:**
   - `t` is initialized to `b`. The variable `t` is then adjusted to account for the screens needed for the 2x2 icons. This is done by dividing `b` by 2 and rounding up if `b` is odd.
   - This is correct because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells.

3. **Handling Remaining Cells with 1x1 Icons:**
   - `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. This represents the remaining cells on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, the number of screens `t` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, `t2` is calculated as `a - t1` (the number of 1x1 icons that still need to be placed).
   - The number of additional screens needed for `t2` 1x1 icons is added to `t`. If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t2 // 15` screens are added. Otherwise, `t2 // 15 + 1` screens are added.

### Testing the Program:
Let's consider the test cases provided in the problem description:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `1 1`
  - Output: `1`
  - Explanation: One 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, leaving 11 cells. One 1x1 icon can fit in those 11 cells.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `7 2`
  - Output: `1`
  - Explanation: Two 2x2 icons occupy 8 cells, leaving 7 cells. Seven 1x1 icons can fit in those 7 cells.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `12 4`
  - Output: `2`
  - Explanation: Four 2x2 icons occupy 16 cells, which means we need 2 screens. After placing the 2x2 icons, we have 14 cells left, which can fit 12 1x1 icons.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `0 3`
  - Output: `2`
  - Explanation: Three 2x2 icons require 2 screens.

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `1 0`
  - Output: `1`
  - Explanation: One 1x1 icon requires 1 screen.

- **Test Case 6:**
  - Input: `8 1`
  - Output: `1`
  - Explanation: One 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, leaving 11 cells. Eight 1x1 icons can fit in those 11 cells.

- **Test Case 7:**
  - Input: `0 0`
  - Output: `0`
  - Explanation: No icons require 0 screens.

- **Test Case 8:**
  - Input: `2 0`
  - Output: `1`
  - Explanation: Two 1x1 icons require 1 screen.

- **Test Case 9:**
  - Input: `15 0`
  - Output: `1`
  - Explanation: Fifteen 1x1 icons require 1 screen.

- **Test Case 10:**
  - Input: `8 2`
  - Output: `2`
  - Explanation: Two 2x2 icons occupy 8 cells, leaving 7 cells. Eight 1x1 icons can fit in those 7 cells, but we need an additional screen.

- **Test Case 11:**
  - Input: `0 9`
  - Output: `5`
  - Explanation: Nine 2x2 icons require 5 screens.

### Edge Cases:
- **Edge Case 1:**
  - Input: `15 0`
  - Output: `1`
  - Explanation: Fifteen 1x1 icons fit exactly in one screen.

- **Edge Case 2:**
  - Input: `0 9`
  - Output: `5`
  - Explanation: Nine 2x2 icons require 5 screens.

- **Edge Case 3:**
  - Input: `16 0`
  - Output: `2`
  - Explanation: Sixteen 1x1 icons require two screens.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the provided test cases and edge cases. The logic is sound and the calculations are accurate.

**Final: True**
