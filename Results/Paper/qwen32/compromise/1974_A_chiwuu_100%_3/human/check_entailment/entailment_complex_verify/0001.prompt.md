You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    #State: The printed values of `t` for each of the `n` iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons, respectively. It calculates and prints the total number of 2x2 icons needed to accommodate both types of icons, ensuring that the total area covered by the icons is minimized.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of 5x3 screens needed to place a given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons. Each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns).

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 icons (a) and 2x2 icons (b). The program then calculates the minimum number of screens required.

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `n` is read.
   - For each test case, the number of 1x1 icons `a` and 2x2 icons `b` are read.

2. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The number of screens required for 2x2 icons is calculated as `t = b // 2`. If `b` is odd, one additional screen is needed, hence `t = b // 2 + 1`.
   - This part seems correct as placing each 2x2 icon requires 4 cells, and we need to account for the extra screen if there's an odd number of 2x2 icons.

3. **Calculating Remaining Space:**
   - The total cells used by 2x2 icons is `b * 4`.
   - The remaining cells available after placing 2x2 icons on `t` screens is `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - If the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`t1 >= a`), no additional screens are needed.
   - If not, the number of additional screens required for 1x1 icons is calculated. If the remaining icons `t2 = a - t1` can fill a full screen (15 cells), then `t2 // 15` additional screens are needed. Otherwise, one more screen is required (`t2 // 15 + 1`).

4. **Output:**
   - The total number of screens `t` is printed for each test case.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the program with the first test case:
- Input: `1 1`
- Calculation:
  - `t = 1 // 2 + 1 = 1`
  - Remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons: `1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`
  - Since `11 >= 1`, no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `1` (correct)

The logic seems to correctly handle the placement of both 1x1 and 2x2 icons across the minimum number of screens.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the logic and verifying with an example, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.
