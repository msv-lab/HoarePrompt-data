The code appends `1 << j` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` initially contains three elements: `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`. After appending `1 << j`, `ans` will now have four elements.

Output State: **`ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j]`; `j` is not equal to `i`.**

This means that the list `ans` now includes the new element `1 << j` at the end, while the condition that `j` is not equal to `i` remains unchanged.
