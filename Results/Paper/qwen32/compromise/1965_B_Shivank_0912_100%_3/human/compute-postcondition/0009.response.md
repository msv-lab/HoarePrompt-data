The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` is 2, so after the operation `i = i + 1`, `i` becomes 3. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an integer read from the input; `k` must be at least 8; `i` is 3**.
