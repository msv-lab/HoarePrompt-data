To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which is just `j` in this case. The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `19`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is the first input integer (remains unchanged).
- `k` is the second input integer (remains unchanged).
- `tc` is `tc + 1` (remains unchanged).
- `t` remains the same (remains unchanged).
- `i` is `i_final` where `1 << (i_final + 1)` is the smallest power of 2 greater than `k` (remains unchanged).
- `ans` is calculated based on the value of `j` (remains unchanged until recalculated in the next iteration).
- `j` is the current index in the loop.

Since the loop increments `j` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's assume `j` was `j_final` at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `j_final + 1`.

State: **`n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `tc` is `tc + 1`, `t` remains the same, `i` is `i_final` where `1 << (i_final + 1)` is the smallest power of 2 greater than `k`, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` if `j` equals `i`; otherwise, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j]` and `j` is `j_final + 1`**.

Since we don't know the exact value of `j_final`, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `tc` is `tc + 1`, `t` remains the same, `i` is `i_final` where `1 << (i_final + 1)` is the smallest power of 2 greater than `k`, `ans` is yet to be recalculated based on the new `j`, `j` is `j + 1`**. 

However, since we need to specify the exact state, let's assume `j` was `j_final` at the end of the previous iteration. Thus, at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `tc` is `tc + 1`, `t` remains the same, `i` is `i_final` where `1 << (i_final + 1)` is the smallest power of 2 greater than `k`, `ans` is yet to be recalculated based on the new `j`, `j` is `j_final + 1`**.

For clarity, let's assume `j_final` was `5` at the end of the previous iteration. Then at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `tc` is `tc + 1`, `t` remains the same, `i` is `i_final` where `1 << (i_final + 1)` is the smallest power of 2 greater than `k`, `ans` is yet to be recalculated based on the new `j`, `j` is 6**.

But since we don't know the exact `j_final`, the generalized answer is:

State: **`n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `tc` is `tc + 1`, `t` remains the same, `i` is `i_final` where `1 << (i_final + 1)` is the smallest power of 2 greater than `k`, `ans` is yet to be recalculated based on the new `j`, `j` is `j + 1`**.

Therefore, the final answer is:

State: **`n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `tc` is `tc + 1`, `t` remains the same, `i` is `i_final` where `1 << (i_final + 1)` is the smallest power of 2 greater than `k`, `ans` is yet to be recalculated based on the new `j`, `j` is `j + 1`**.
