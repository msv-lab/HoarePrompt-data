To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the loop's behavior. The loop continues to execute as long as `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`. Each iteration increments `ans[i + 1]` by `ans[i]`.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue until `ans[5]` exceeds `arr[5]`. The value of `ans[5]` grows exponentially with each iteration, specifically as `ans[5] = arr[4] + (k + 1) * ans[4]`, where `k` is the number of iterations.

From the provided states:
- After 1 iteration: `ans[5] = arr[4] + 2 * ans[4]`
- After 2 iterations: `ans[5] = arr[4] + 3 * ans[4]`
- After 3 iterations: `ans[5] = arr[4] + 4 * ans[4]`

This pattern suggests that the loop will continue until `ans[5]` is greater than `arr[5]`. The loop will stop once `ans[5]` exceeds `arr[5]`, meaning the final value of `ans[5]` will be the smallest value greater than `arr[5]` that follows the pattern `arr[4] + (k + 1) * ans[4]`.

Let's denote the number of iterations required for `ans[5]` to exceed `arr[5]` as `k`. The loop will stop when `arr[4] + (k + 1) * ans[4] > arr[5]`. The final value of `ans[5]` will be `arr[4] + (k + 1) * ans[4]`.

Since the exact value of `arr[5]` and `ans[4]` are not given, we can express the final state in terms of these variables.

The final output state will be:
- `arr` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `i` remains 4.
- `ans[5]` will be the smallest value greater than `arr[5]` that follows the pattern `arr[4] + (k + 1) * ans[4]`.

In summary, the loop will stop once `ans[5]` exceeds `arr[5]`, and the final value of `ans[5]` will be `arr[4] + (k + 1) * ans[4]`, where `k` is the number of iterations required for `ans[5]` to exceed `arr[5]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \) and `arr[5]` is adjusted such that `arr[5]` is less than `ans[5]`; `n` is an integer such that \( 3 \leq n \leq 500 \); `ans` is a list of integers where `ans[5]` is the smallest value greater than `arr[5]` that follows the pattern `arr[4] + (k + 1) * ans[4]`; `i` is 4.**
