The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value, and `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 500.
- The loop iterates over the range `range(n - 2)`.

To proceed to the next iteration:
- `i` must be incremented by 1.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is the loop's upper bound.

Let's assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

Since the loop iterates over `range(n - 2)`, the loop will continue as long as `i < n - 2`.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 500, `ans` is a list of integers, and `i` is `k`.

State at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be `k + 1`.
- `n` remains `n`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 500, `ans` is a list of integers, `i` is `k + 1`**
