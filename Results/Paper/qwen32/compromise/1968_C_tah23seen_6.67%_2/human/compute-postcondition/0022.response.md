Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 500, `ans` is a list of integers. If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, then `ans[i + 1]` is updated to `arr[i] + 4 * ans[i]`, and `ans[k + 1]` is `ans[k]` with `arr[k + 2]` being greater than `ans[k + 2]`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans[i + 1]`.**
