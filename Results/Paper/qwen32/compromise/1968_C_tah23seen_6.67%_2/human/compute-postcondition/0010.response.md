The code snippet `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` modifies the value of `ans[i + 1]` by adding the value of `ans[i]` to it. Given the initial state, `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is `2 * arr[0] + 1`, and `ans[2]` is `4 * arr[0] + 2`. 

The impact of the code is that `ans[i + 1]` will be updated to its current value plus `ans[i]`. Since the code does not specify a particular `i`, we need to consider the general case where `i` could be any valid index from 0 to `n-2` (since `ans[i + 1]` must exist).

For the sake of providing a concrete example, let's assume `i` is 1 (a common and illustrative case):

- `ans[2]` would be updated to `ans[2] + ans[1]`, which means `4 * arr[0] + 2 + (2 * arr[0] + 1) = 6 * arr[0] + 3`.

However, to generalize, the output state will reflect the change for `ans[i + 1]` specifically:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \), `n` is an integer such that \( 3 \leq n \leq 500 \), `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is `2 * arr[0] + 1`, `ans[2]` is `6 * arr[0] + 3` if `i` is 1, and the rest of the elements in `ans` remain 0 except for `ans[i + 1]` which is updated to `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`.**

In simpler terms, `ans[i + 1]` is now `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`, and all other variables retain their previous values unless `i` is specified differently. For `i = 1`, `ans[2]` becomes `6 * arr[0] + 3`.
