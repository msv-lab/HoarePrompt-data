To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the `ans` list based on the `arr` list and the value of `n`.

### Loop Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`.
   - All other elements in `ans` are initialized to `0`.

2. **Loop Iterations**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 3` (since the range is `n - 2`).
   - For each iteration `i`, `ans[i + 1]` is initially set to `arr[i] + ans[i]`.
   - If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, it is incremented by `ans[i]` repeatedly until it is greater than `arr[i + 1]`.

### Iteration Details

- **First Iteration (i = 0)**:
  - `ans[1]` is set to `arr[0] + ans[0] = arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1) = 2 * arr[0] + 1`.
  - If `ans[1]` is less than `arr[1]`, it is incremented by `ans[0]` repeatedly until it is greater than `arr[1]`.

- **Second Iteration (i = 1)**:
  - `ans[2]` is set to `arr[1] + ans[1]`.
  - If `ans[2]` is less than `arr[2]`, it is incremented by `ans[1]` repeatedly until it is greater than `arr[2]`.

- **Third Iteration (i = 2)**:
  - `ans[3]` is set to `arr[2] + ans[2]`.
  - If `ans[3]` is less than `arr[3]`, it is incremented by `ans[2]` repeatedly until it is greater than `arr[3]`.

This pattern continues until the loop completes all `n - 2` iterations.

### Final Output State

After all iterations, the `ans` list will be such that for each `i` from `0` to `n-2`:
- `ans[i + 1]` is the smallest integer greater than `arr[i]` that can be expressed as a sum of `ans[i]` and its previous values in `ans`.

### Conclusion

The final `ans` list will be fully computed based on the given `arr` list and the rules defined in the loop. The `arr` list and the value of `n` remain unchanged throughout the process.

Output State: **`ans` is a list where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each `i` from `0` to `n-2`, `ans[i + 1]` is the smallest integer greater than `arr[i]` that can be expressed as a sum of `ans[i]` and its previous values in `ans`.**

In simpler terms, `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and each subsequent element `ans[i + 1]` is calculated by adding `arr[i]` to `ans[i]` and incrementing further if necessary to ensure it is greater than `arr[i + 1]`.
