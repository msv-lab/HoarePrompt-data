The code snippet `ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]` updates the value at index `i + 1` in the list `ans` to be the sum of the value at index `i` in `arr` and the value at index `i` in `ans`. Given that `i` is 4, `ans[5]` is updated to be `arr[4] + ans[4]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 500, `ans` is a list of integers where `ans[5]` is now `arr[4] + ans[4]`, `i` is 4**.
