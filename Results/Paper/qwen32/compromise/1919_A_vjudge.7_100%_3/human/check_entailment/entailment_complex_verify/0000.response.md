### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the correctness of the program by reasoning through the game mechanics and the provided code annotations.

#### Game Mechanics Recap:
1. **Turn Order**: Alice goes first, then Bob, and they alternate turns.
2. **Moves**:
   - Each player can choose to swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
   - The player must then remove 1 coin from their current wallet.
3. **Winning Condition**: The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., when their wallet has 0 coins) loses.
4. **Optimal Play**: Both players play optimally, meaning they make the best possible move at each step to ensure their victory.

#### Key Insight:
The game can be analyzed based on the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins (`a + b`):
- If the total number of coins is **even**, Bob will always win.
- If the total number of coins is **odd**, Alice will always win.

#### Explanation of Parity Logic:
- **Even Total Coins**:
  - If the total number of coins is even, the players will alternate turns until all coins are gone.
  - Since Alice goes first, Bob will always make the last move, thus winning the game.
- **Odd Total Coins**:
  - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will be able to make the last move, thus winning the game.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program correctly implements this logic:
```python
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a + b & 1 == 0:  # Check if the sum of coins is even
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```
Annotations:
- The program reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
- It checks the parity of the sum of the coins.
- If the sum is even, it prints "Bob".
- If the sum is odd, it prints "Alice".

#### Verification with Examples:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:
1. `1 1` -> Total = 2 (even) -> Bob wins.
2. `1 4` -> Total = 5 (odd) -> Alice wins.
3. `5 3` -> Total = 8 (even) -> Bob wins.
4. `4 5` -> Total = 9 (odd) -> Alice wins.
5. `11 9` -> Total = 20 (even) -> Bob wins.
6. `83 91` -> Total = 174 (even) -> Bob wins.
7. `1032 9307` -> Total = 10339 (odd) -> Alice wins.
8. `839204 7281` -> Total = 846485 (odd) -> Alice wins.
9. `1000000000 1000000000` -> Total = 2000000000 (even) -> Bob wins.
10. `53110 2024` -> Total = 55134 (even) -> Bob wins.

All the provided examples match the expected outcomes based on the parity of the total number of coins.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. The logic and implementation are consistent with the game mechanics and the optimal play strategy.

**Final: True**
