### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the program, we need to carefully analyze the logic behind the game and the provided solution.

#### Game Mechanics Recap:
1. Alice and Bob take turns.
2. Each turn, a player can either swap wallets or not.
3. The player must then remove one coin from their current wallet.
4. The player who cannot make a move (i.e., when both wallets are empty) loses.

#### Observations and Strategy:
1. **Parity Analysis**:
   - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves. This means that Bob can always ensure that he is the one to make the last move, making Bob the winner.
   - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is odd, Alice can always make the first move and then mirror Bob's moves. This means that Alice can always ensure that she is the one to make the last move, making Alice the winner.

2. **Bitwise Operation**:
   - The bitwise operation `a + b & 1` is used to check the parity of the sum. If the result is `0`, the sum is even; if the result is `1`, the sum is odd.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the number of coins Alice and Bob have.
- It then checks if the sum of the coins (`a + b`) is even or odd using the bitwise AND operation (`a + b & 1`).
- If the sum is even (`a + b & 1 == 0`), it prints "Bob".
- If the sum is odd (`a + b & 1 != 0`), it prints "Alice".

#### Validation with Annotations:
- The annotations confirm that the program correctly reads the inputs and performs the necessary operations.
- The annotations also confirm that the program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic based on the parity of the total number of coins. The bitwise AND operation is an efficient and correct method to determine the parity. The annotations support the correctness of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
