The code snippet `operational_list = input().split()` takes an input string from the user, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `operational_list`. Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`rev_res` is an empty string; `y` is [previous value of y] + 1; `rev_val` is an empty list; `list_len` is the first value from the input; `max_power` is the second value from the input; `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input.**
