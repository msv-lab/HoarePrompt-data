Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 1, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is a concatenation of original strings from `operational_list` where the reversed string has the same length as the original, plus `str(val_in)` if `x` is even, or the reverse of the current `val_in` if `x` is odd for all `x` in the range of the length of the original `rev_val`, `list_len` is the first part of the input split by space, and `max_power` is the second part of the input split by space.**

In simpler terms: `rev_val` is now an empty list, while all other variables retain their initial values.
