The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `m`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then performs operations on the list, involving reversing some of the integers and sorting them, and finally compares a constructed value to `10` raised to the power of `m`. Based on this comparison, it prints either "Sasha" or "Anna" for each test case.
