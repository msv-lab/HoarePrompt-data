The given Python code snippet initializes an empty list named `li`. This action does not affect any of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, `a`). Therefore, the output state will reflect the initialization of `li` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500; `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6; `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9; `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`; `li` is an empty list.**
