Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a new list of integers derived from the input and contains at least one element, `n` is `n + 1`, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the new list `s`, `cnt` is updated such that the count of `c` is incremented by 1, `c` is the next element in the list `s` after the current `c`, `ans` is updated to `ans + (zeroes - cnt[0])`.**

In simple terms, the value of `ans` is updated by adding the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]` to its previous value. All other variables retain their previously described properties and values.
