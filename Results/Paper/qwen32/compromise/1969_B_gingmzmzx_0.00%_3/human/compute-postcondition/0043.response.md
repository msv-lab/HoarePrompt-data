The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the value at index `c` in the list `cnt` by 1. Given the initial state, `cnt` is either `[2, 0]` or `[0, 2]`, and `c` is the next element in the list `s`, which means `c` can be either 0 or 1.

If `c` is 0, `cnt[0]` will be incremented by 1. So, if `cnt` was `[2, 0]`, it will become `[3, 0]`. If `cnt` was `[0, 2]`, it will become `[1, 2]`.

If `c` is 1, `cnt[1]` will be incremented by 1. So, if `cnt` was `[2, 0]`, it will become `[2, 1]`. If `cnt` was `[0, 2]`, it will become `[0, 3]`.

The values of `t`, `s`, `n`, and `zeroes` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a new list of integers derived from the input that must have at least 1 element remaining, `n` is `n-1`, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the new list `s`, `cnt` is either `[3, 0]` if `c` was 0 and `cnt` was `[2, 0]`, `[1, 2]` if `c` was 0 and `cnt` was `[0, 2]`, `[2, 1]` if `c` was 1 and `cnt` was `[2, 0]`, or `[0, 3]` if `c` was 1 and `cnt` was `[0, 2]`, `c` is the next element in the list `s`**.
