Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a new list of integers derived from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `n` is `n-1`, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the new list `s`, `cnt` is either `[2, 0]` if `c` was 0 or `[0, 2]` if `c` was 1, `c` is the next element in the list `s`. If `c` is 0, `cnt` is updated to `[2, 0]`. If `c` is 1, `cnt` is updated to `[0, 2]` and `ans` is incremented by 1. If `c` is 1, `ans` is also updated to `ans + (zeroes - cnt[0])`.**
