The code snippet `ans += zeroes - cnt[0]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]` to it. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `s` is a new list of integers derived from the input that must have at least 1 element
- `n` is `n-1`
- `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the new list `s`
- `cnt` is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]`
- `ans` is 0
- `c` is not equal to 0

The value of `ans` changes to `0 + (zeroes - cnt[0])`, which simplifies to `zeroes - cnt[0]`.

Therefore, the updated output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a new list of integers derived from the input that must have at least 1 element, `n` is `n-1`, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the new list `s`, `cnt` is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]`, `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`, and `c` is not equal to 0.**
