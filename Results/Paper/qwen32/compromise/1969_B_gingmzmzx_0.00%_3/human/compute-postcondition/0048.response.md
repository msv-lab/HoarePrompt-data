To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. **t**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **s**: A new list of integers derived from the input.
3. **n**: It is mentioned as `n is n-1`, but without more context, it's unclear how this is initially set or used. We'll assume `n` is related to the length of the list `s` or another variable.
4. **zeroes**: The count of 0s in the new list `s`.
5. **cnt**: A list containing two elements: `total_zeros` and `total_ones`, where `total_zeros` is the count of 0s in `s` and `total_ones` is the count of 1s in `s`.
6. **ans**: The accumulated value based on the loop's logic.

Given the lack of specific details about how `ans` is calculated, we can only describe it based on the provided information. Typically, `ans` would be computed within a loop that processes the list `s` and accumulates some value based on the counts of 0s and 1s, or other conditions.

However, since the exact computation of `ans` isn't specified, we can only describe it as the accumulated value resulting from the loop's logic.

### Explanation:
- **zeroes**: This is the count of 0s in the list `s`.
- **cnt**: This is a list `[total_zeros, total_ones]`, where `total_zeros` is the same as `zeroes`, and `total_ones` is the count of 1s in the list `s`.
- **ans**: This is the result of some accumulation process, which isn't detailed here.

### Conclusion:
The `print(ans)` statement will output the accumulated value `ans`, which is determined by the loop's logic processing the list `s`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the accumulated value based on the loop's logic processing the list `s`)**
