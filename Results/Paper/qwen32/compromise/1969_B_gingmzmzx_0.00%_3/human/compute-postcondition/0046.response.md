Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a new list of integers derived from the input that must have at least 1 element remaining, `n` is `n-1`, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the new list `s`, `cnt` is either `[3, 0]` if `c` was 0 and `cnt` was `[2, 0]`, `[1, 2]` if `c` was 0 and `cnt` was `[0, 2]`, `[2, 1]` if `c` was 1 and `cnt` was `[2, 0]`, or `[0, 3]` if `c` was 1 and `cnt` was `[0, 2]`, `c` is the next element in the list `s`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1] > 0`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans + (zeroes - cnt[0])`.**
