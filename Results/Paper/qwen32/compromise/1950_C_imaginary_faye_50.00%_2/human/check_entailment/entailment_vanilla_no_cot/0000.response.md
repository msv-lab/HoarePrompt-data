Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be corrected for it to work properly:

1. The function `func_1()` is defined after it is called, which will cause a `NameError` because Python reads the code from top to bottom and `func_1()` is not defined when it is first called.

2. The handling of hours from 13 to 23 is incorrect. The program currently prints hours from 13 to 23 as '01' to '09', which is not correct. For example, 13:00 should be converted to 01:00 PM, not 01:00 PM.

3. The program does not correctly handle the special case for 12:00 AM and 12:00 PM.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h = int(s[:2])
        m = s[3:]
        if h == 0:
            print('12:{} AM'.format(m))
        elif h < 12:
            print('{}:{} AM'.format(s[:2], m))
        elif h == 12:
            print('12:{} PM'.format(m))
        else:
            print('{:02d}:{} PM'.format(h - 12, m))

func_1()
```

In this corrected version:
- The function `func_1()` is defined before it is called.
- The hour conversion logic is corrected to handle all cases properly.
- The `{:02d}` format ensures that the hour is printed with a leading zero if necessary.
