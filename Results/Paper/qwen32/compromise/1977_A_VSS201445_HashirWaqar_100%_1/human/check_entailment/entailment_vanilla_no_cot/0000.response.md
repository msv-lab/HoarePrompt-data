To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic based on the problem description.

The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move. We need to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Total Moves (`n`)**: This is the total number of moves Nikita can make, and each move can either add or remove one cube.
2. **Target Cubes (`m`)**: This is the number of cubes Nikita wants to have at the end.

For Nikita to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, the following conditions must be met:

- **Parity Check**: The difference `(n - m)` must be even. This is because every time Nikita adds a cube, the number of cubes increases by 1, and every time he removes a cube, the number of cubes decreases by 1. Therefore, the net effect of an even number of moves can only result in an even change in the number of cubes.
  
- **Sufficiency of Moves**: The number of moves `n` must be at least `m` because, in the worst case, Nikita might start with 0 cubes and needs at least `m` moves to add `m` cubes.

The provided program checks these conditions:

- `n >= m` ensures there are enough moves to potentially reach `m` cubes.
- `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the target number of cubes is even, allowing for the possibility of reaching exactly `m` cubes.

If both conditions are satisfied, the program prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

Let's verify the conditions with the example test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**: `n = 3`, `m = 3`
   - `n >= m` is `True` (3 >= 3).
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is `True` ((3 - 3) % 2 == 0).
   - Output: "YES" (Correct).

2. **Test Case 2**: `n = 2`, `m = 4`
   - `n >= m` is `False` (2 < 4).
   - Output: "NO" (Correct).

3. **Test Case 3**: `n = 5`, `m = 3`
   - `n >= m` is `True` (5 >= 3).
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is `True` ((5 - 3) % 2 == 0).
   - Output: "YES" (Correct).

The program correctly handles all these cases, and the logic is sound.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
