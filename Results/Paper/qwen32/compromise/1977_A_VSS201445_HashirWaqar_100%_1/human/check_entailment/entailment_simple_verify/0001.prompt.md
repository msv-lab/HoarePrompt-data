You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: t test cases have been processed, and for each test case, 'YES' is printed if n is greater than or equal to m and the difference (n - m) is even; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The values of t, n, and m are unchanged from their initial state, except they have been used to determine the output for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove one cube in each move. We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Let's consider the possible scenarios:
- If `n < m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes because the maximum number of cubes Nikita can add is `n`.
- If `n >= m`, it's possible to have `m` cubes if the difference `(n - m)` is even. This is because:
  - If `(n - m)` is even, Nikita can perform `(n - m) / 2` moves to remove cubes and the remaining moves can be used to add cubes. This way, the net effect is that he ends up with `m` cubes.
  - If `(n - m)` is odd, it's impossible to have `m` cubes because the number of add and remove operations must balance out in pairs to end up with an exact number of cubes, which is not possible with an odd difference.

The given program checks these conditions correctly. It ensures that `n` is at least `m` and that `(n - m)` is even, printing "YES" if both conditions are met and "NO" otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
