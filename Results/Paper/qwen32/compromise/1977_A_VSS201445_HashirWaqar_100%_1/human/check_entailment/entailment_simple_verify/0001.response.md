Reasoning:

The problem description specifies that Nikita can either add or remove one cube in each move. The goal is to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Let's break down the logic and verify if the program correctly implements this logic:

1. **Case 1: n < m**
   - If `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes because the maximum number of cubes Nikita can add is `n`. Hence, the program should output "NO" in this case.
   - The program correctly handles this case by checking `n >= m`. If `n < m`, the condition `n >= m` fails, and the program prints "NO".

2. **Case 2: n >= m**
   - If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, it's possible to have `m` cubes if the difference `(n - m)` is even. This is because:
     - If `(n - m)` is even, Nikita can perform `(n - m) / 2` moves to remove cubes and the remaining moves can be used to add cubes. This way, the net effect is that he ends up with `m` cubes.
     - If `(n - m)` is odd, it's impossible to have `m` cubes because the number of add and remove operations must balance out in pairs to end up with an exact number of cubes, which is not possible with an odd difference.
   - The program correctly handles this case by checking `(n - m) % 2 == 0`. If the condition is true, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

The annotations provided in the annotated version of the code align with the logic described above. They correctly state that the program processes `t` test cases and prints "YES" if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is even; otherwise, it prints "NO".

The original assessment accurately describes the reasoning and the correctness of the program. The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Final: **True**
