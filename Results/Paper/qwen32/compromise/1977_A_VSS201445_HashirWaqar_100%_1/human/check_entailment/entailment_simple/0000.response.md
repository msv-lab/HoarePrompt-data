Reasoning:  
To determine if the given Python program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic in the function `func()` correctly decides whether it is possible for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. 

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move.
   - We need to determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If `n < m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes because the maximum number of cubes we can add is `n`.
   - If `n >= m`, it's possible to have `m` cubes if the difference `(n - m)` is even. This is because each addition or removal is a move of 1, and to end up with exactly `m` cubes, the number of additions must be exactly `m` and the number of removals must be `n - m`. For this to be possible, `n - m` must be even (since an even number of removals will balance the additions to reach exactly `m` cubes).

3. **Logic in the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
   - It checks if `n >= m` and if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`. If both conditions are true, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Verification:**
   - The logic correctly handles the case where `n < m` by printing "NO".
   - The logic correctly handles the case where `n >= m` by checking if the difference `(n - m)` is even, which is necessary and sufficient for the problem.

Since the logic in the program matches the problem requirements and correctly handles all possible cases, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
