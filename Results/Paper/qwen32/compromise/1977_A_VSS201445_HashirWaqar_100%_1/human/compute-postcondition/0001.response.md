Output State: **t test cases have been processed, and for each test case, 'YES' is printed if n is greater than or equal to m and the difference (n - m) is even; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The values of t, n, and m are unchanged from their initial state, except they have been used to determine the output for each test case.**
