The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common convention in Python to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. The loop will execute based on the value of the expression `int(input())`, which is the number of iterations the loop will perform.

Given that `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 100`, the loop will execute `t` times if `int(input())` returns `t`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the input to `int(input())` must be `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `int(input())` must return `t`**
