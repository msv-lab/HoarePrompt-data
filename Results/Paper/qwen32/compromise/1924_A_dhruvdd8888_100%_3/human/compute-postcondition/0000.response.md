The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m`. The initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` have certain constraints, but only `t` is not directly affected by the code snippet provided. The values of `n`, `k`, and `m` are updated based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input where 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**
