Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the original assessment using the annotated version of the code.

### Problem Description Recap:
The password should:
1. Consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. No digit should come after a letter.
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Program Code Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases and checks each password according to the given conditions using the `func_1` function.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**: Two lists, `digits` and `letters`, are initialized to store digits and letters from the password, respectively.
2. **Character Classification**: The function iterates through each character of the password:
   - If the character is a digit, it is added to the `digits` list.
   - If the character is a letter, it is added to the `letters` list.
3. **Digit-After-Letter Check**: Another iteration through the password checks if any letter follows a digit. If this condition is found, the function returns 'NO'.
4. **Sorted Check**: The function checks if the `digits` list and `letters` list are sorted in non-decreasing order. If either list is not sorted, the function returns 'NO'.
5. **Final Check**: If all conditions are satisfied, the function returns 'YES'.

### Annotations:
Annotations confirm:
- `digits` and `letters` correctly store their respective characters.
- `last_digit_index` correctly tracks the last position of a digit.
- The function correctly checks if no letter follows a digit.
- The function correctly checks if both `digits` and `letters` lists are sorted.

### Original Assessment:
The original assessment claims the program is incorrect due to:
- Not correctly handling passwords with only digits or only letters.

However, this claim is misleading. The program **does** correctly handle passwords with only digits or only letters:
- If the password contains only digits, the `letters` list will be empty, and the `digits` list will be checked for sorting.
- If the password contains only letters, the `digits` list will be empty, and the `letters` list will be checked for sorting.

### Verification:
Let's verify the original assessment with the provided test cases:
1. **Password with only digits (`"321"`)**:
   - `digits = ['3', '2', '1']`
   - `letters = []`
   - `digits` is not sorted, so the function returns 'NO'.

2. **Password with only letters (`"cba"`)**:
   - `digits = []`
   - `letters = ['c', 'b', 'a']`
   - `letters` is not sorted, so the function returns 'NO'.

Both test cases are correctly handled by the program, contradicting the original assessment.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is incorrect. The program correctly verifies passwords according to the specified conditions.

**Final: True**
