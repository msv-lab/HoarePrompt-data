Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains a logical error in the function `func_1` that can lead to incorrect results. Specifically, the function does not correctly handle the case where the password contains only digits or only letters. While the function checks that digits and letters are sorted and that no digit comes after a letter, it does not ensure that the entire password meets the conditions specified.

Let's consider the following test cases:

1. **Password with only digits:**
   - Input: `n = 3, password = "321"`
   - Expected Output: `NO` (because the digits are not in non-decreasing order)
   - Actual Output: `YES` (the function does not check the order of digits when there are no letters)

2. **Password with only letters:**
   - Input: `n = 3, password = "cba"`
   - Expected Output: `NO` (because the letters are not in non-decreasing order)
   - Actual Output: `YES` (the function does not check the order of letters when there are no digits)

To fix the program, the function `func_1` should be modified to ensure that the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order regardless of whether there are both digits and letters, only digits, or only letters in the password.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    last_digit_index = -1
    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
            last_digit_index = i
        else:
            letters.append(char)
            if last_digit_index != -1:
                return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

This corrected version ensures that the function checks the order of digits and letters correctly, even when the password contains only digits or only letters.
