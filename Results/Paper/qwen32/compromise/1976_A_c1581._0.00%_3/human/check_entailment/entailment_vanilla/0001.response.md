Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Problem Conditions Recap:
1. Passwords should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. No digit should come after a letter.
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes each test case by iterating `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.

2. **Password Validation (`func_1` function):**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for checking if a given password is strong.
   - It initializes two lists: `digits` and `letters` to store the digits and letters in the password, respectively.
   - It then iterates through each character in the password:
     - If the character is a digit, it appends it to the `digits` list.
     - If the character is a letter, it appends it to the `letters` list.
   - The function keeps track of the last index where a digit was found using `last_digit_index`.
     - If a letter is encountered after a digit (i.e., `last_digit_index` is not `-1`), it returns `'NO'` because a digit should not come after a letter.
   - After processing all characters, the function checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns `'NO'`.
   - Similarly, it checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns `'NO'`.
   - If all checks pass, it returns `'YES'`.

### Correctness of the Program:
- The program correctly handles the input and processes each password according to the problem's conditions.
- It ensures that no digit comes after a letter by using the `last_digit_index` variable.
- It checks that digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The program correctly handles the edge cases mentioned in the problem, such as passwords with only letters or only digits.

### Conclusion:
The program is correctly implementing the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
