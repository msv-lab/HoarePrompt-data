Output State: **password is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and each character in the string is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `digits` is an empty list.**

In simple terms, the `password` remains the same as it was initially, and a new variable `digits` is created and initialized as an empty list.
