### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to determine the maximum number of points you can score in the card game described. However, the current implementation does not correctly compute this score based on the rules provided.

The program calculates the number of duplicate integers in the list of integers representing the cards in your hand. This is done by comparing the length of the list (`len(tokens)`) with the length of the set created from the list (`len({*tokens})`). The difference between these two lengths gives the number of duplicate integers in your hand.

However, the game's rules specify that you score points based on whether a card's number already exists on the table. Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. The program does not simulate the game or account for Nene's optimal strategy. Instead, it simply counts the number of duplicate integers, which does not necessarily equate to the maximum points you can score.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly determine the maximum number of points you can score based on the rules of the game. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
