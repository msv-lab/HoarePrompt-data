### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally. Here’s a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Game Strategy**: The game involves strategic decisions where both players try to maximize their points. Nene always plays optimally to maximize her points and minimize yours. The current program does not simulate this strategy at all.

2. **Logic Mismatch**: The program calculates the number of non-unique cards you have (`len(tokens) - len({*tokens})`), which is not directly related to the number of points you can score. The number of points depends on the sequence of moves and the state of the table during the game.

3. **No Simulation of Game Turns**: The program does not simulate the turns of the game, where each player places cards and scores points based on the presence of cards on the table.

4. **No Handling of Opponent's Optimal Play**: The program does not account for Nene's optimal play, which is critical to determining the maximum points you can score.

### Example Analysis:

Let's consider the provided example:

**Input:**
```
1
4
1 1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Current Program Output:**
```
1
```

While the current program gives the correct output for this specific example, it does not guarantee correctness for all possible inputs due to the lack of proper game simulation and strategic decision-making.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the game considering the strategic play of both players. Here’s a brief outline of how you could approach this:

1. **Track Card Counts**: Keep track of the count of each card in both players' hands.
2. **Simulate Turns**: Simulate the turns of both players, considering Nene's optimal play.
3. **Track Points**: Keep track of the points scored by both players based on the rules provided.

### Conclusion:

The provided program is incorrect because it does not simulate the game and does not account for the strategic decisions made by both players. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
