Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The task is to determine the maximum number of points you can score in a card game against an opponent who plays optimally. The program, however, simply counts the number of duplicate integers in the list of cards you have, which does not take into account the strategic play of the game or the optimal moves of the opponent.

The logic needed to solve this problem involves simulating the game or using a strategy to determine the maximum points you can score. This often requires analyzing the distribution of cards and considering the optimal moves for both players. The provided program does not implement any such strategy and only counts duplicates, which is insufficient to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
