The provided Python code snippet only includes the line `input = sys.stdin.readline`. This line does not change the values of any existing variables or introduce new variables with specific values. It simply reassigns the built-in `input` function to `sys.stdin.readline`, which is a common practice to speed up input reading in competitive programming.

Given this, none of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `l`, or `r` are affected by this line of code. Their initial states remain unchanged.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, and for each query, l and r are integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n; the sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of all q across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; input is reassigned to sys.stdin.readline**.
