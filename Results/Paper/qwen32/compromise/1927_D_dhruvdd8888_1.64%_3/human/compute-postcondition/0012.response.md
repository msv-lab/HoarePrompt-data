To determine what will be printed by the `print(nums)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Values:**
    - `arr` contains tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`.
    - `s` is the index of the last change in the sequence.
    - `e` is 0.
    - `num` is -1.
    - `i` is `N` (where `N` is not specified in the initial state, but it is not used in the `print(nums)` statement).
    - `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
    - `ppp` equals 23.

2. **Understand the Context:**
    - The variable `nums` is mentioned in the `print` statement, but it is not explicitly defined in the initial state. This means we do not have a direct value for `nums`.

3. **Determine the Output:**
    - Since `nums` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value.
    - However, we can infer that `nums` is a list of numbers based on the context that `arr` contains tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`.
    - The `print(nums)` statement will print the contents of the `nums` list.

4. **Final Output:**
    - We cannot provide the exact numerical values of `nums` because they are not specified in the initial state.
    - Therefore, we describe the output in terms of the variable `nums`.

Output: **nums (where nums is a list of numbers)**
