Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the vertices `b` that are directly connected to `a` by an edge; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is an integer such that 0 < k < n; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `numCuts` is 0; `L` is 1; `R` is 25001; `x` is 25001.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `R` has been updated to be equal to `x`, which is 25001. All other variables retain their initial values.
