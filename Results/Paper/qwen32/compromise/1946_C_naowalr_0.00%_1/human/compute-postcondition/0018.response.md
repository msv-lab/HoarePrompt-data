The code assigns the integer value `100001` to the variable `R`. This is calculated from the expression `int(100000.0 + 1)`. The values of `adj`, `n`, `k`, and `L` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the vertices `b` that are directly connected to `a` by an edge; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is an integer such that 0 < k < n; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001.**
