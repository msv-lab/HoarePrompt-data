Output State: **`n` must be at least 2; `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input; `adj[a]` includes `b` appended to its previous contents; `adj[b]` includes `a` appended to its previous contents.**

Natural Language: The value of `n` remains unchanged and must still be at least 2. The integers `a` and `b` remain the same as they were read from standard input. The list `adj[a]` now includes `b` appended to its previous contents. Additionally, the list `adj[b]` now includes `a` appended to its previous contents.
