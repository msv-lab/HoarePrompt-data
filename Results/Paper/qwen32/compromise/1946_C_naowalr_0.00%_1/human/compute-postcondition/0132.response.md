To determine what will be printed by the `print(L)` statement, let's analyze the initial state provided:

- `i` is set to `n - 1`.
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists.
- `z` remains unchanged (its value is not specified).
- `L` is set to `a`.
- `R` is set to `a + 1`.
- `x` is the last calculated midpoint (its value is not specified).
- `numCuts` and `leftover` are determined by the last iteration (their values are not specified).

From this information, the only variable directly relevant to the `print(L)` statement is `L`, which is explicitly stated to be equal to `a`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(L)` statement will simply be the value of `a`.

Output: **a (where a is the value assigned to L)**
