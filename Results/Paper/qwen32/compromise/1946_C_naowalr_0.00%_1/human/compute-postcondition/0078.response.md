Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each `adj[a]` contains all the nodes directly connected to node `a` as specified by the input pairs; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `L` is either 1 or 50001; `R` is either 25001 or 75001; `numCuts` is 0; `z` is 1; `t` is some integer greater than 1; `i` is `n - 1`; `x` is either 25001 or 75001; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `R` is now equal to `x`.**

In simple terms, the variable `R` has been updated to the value of `x`, which can be either 25001 or 75001. All other variables remain unchanged.
