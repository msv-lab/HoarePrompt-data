The given Python code snippet appends the integer `a` to the list `adj[b]`. This means that the list `adj[b]` will now include `a` as one of its elements, in addition to whatever elements it already contained.

Given the initial state, `adj[b]` contains `a` and possibly other elements. After executing the code, `adj[b]` will definitely contain `a`, and any other elements it previously had will remain unchanged. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` contains `b` and possibly other elements, `adj[b]` contains `a` and possibly other elements (now guaranteed to include `a`), `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the second integer read from input, `L` is 1, `R` is 2, `numCuts` is 0, `z` is 1, `t` is some integer greater than 1, `a` and `b` are the two integers read from input, `i` is 2.**
