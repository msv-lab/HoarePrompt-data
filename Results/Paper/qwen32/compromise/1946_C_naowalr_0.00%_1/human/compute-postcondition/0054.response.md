The code snippet `adj[a].append(b)` modifies the adjacency list `adj` by adding the element `b` to the list `adj[a]`. This means that the list at index `a` in `adj` now includes `b` as one of its elements.

Given the initial state, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` contains `b` and `adj[b]` contains `a`. After executing the code, `adj[a]` will contain `b` (if it doesn't already) and potentially other elements as well, but `adj[b]` remains unchanged unless further modifications are made.

All other variables (`n`, `k`, `L`, `R`, `numCuts`, `z`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` contains `b` and possibly other elements, `adj[b]` contains `a` and possibly other elements, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the second integer read from input, `L` is 1, `R` is 2, `numCuts` is 0, `z` is 1, `t` is some integer greater than 1, `a` and `b` are the two integers read from input, `i` is 1.**
