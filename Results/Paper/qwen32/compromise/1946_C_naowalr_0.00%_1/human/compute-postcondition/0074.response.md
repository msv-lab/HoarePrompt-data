The value of `x` is updated to be the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2. Given the initial conditions, `L` is either 1 or 50001, and `R` is either 50001 or 100001. Therefore, the new value of `x` can be calculated as follows:

- If `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001, then `x` becomes `(1 + 50001) // 2 = 25001`.
- If `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001, then `x` becomes `(50001 + 100001) // 2 = 75001`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each `adj[a]` contains all the nodes directly connected to node `a` as specified by the input pairs; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `L` is either 1 or 50001; `R` is either 50001 or 100001; `numCuts` is either greater than `k` or equal to `k` with `leftover` being greater than or equal to `x` if `numCuts` is equal to `k`; `z` is 1; `t` is some integer greater than 1; `i` is `n - 1`; `x` is either 25001 or 75001; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`**.
