To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition `R - L > 1`.

Given the current state:
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the vertices `b` that are directly connected to `a` by an edge.
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `k` is an integer such that 0 < k < n.
- `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`.
- `numCuts` is 0.
- Depending on the values of `numCuts` and `leftover`, `L` and `R` are set as follows:
  - If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001, and `x` is 75001.
  - Otherwise, `L` is 1, `R` is 50001, `numCuts` is 1, and `x` is 25001.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `R - L > 1` must be true. Therefore, we need to ensure that `R` and `L` are set in such a way that their difference is greater than 1.

From the given conditions:
- If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001. In this case, `R - L = 100001 - 50001 = 50000`, which satisfies the condition `R - L > 1`.
- Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001. In this case, `R - L = 50001 - 1 = 50000`, which also satisfies the condition `R - L > 1`.

Since both possible assignments of `L` and `R` satisfy the condition `R - L > 1`, no further adjustments are necessary to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

Therefore, the state remains the same as at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the vertices `b` that are directly connected to `a` by an edge; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is an integer such that 0 < k < n; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `numCuts` is 0; If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001, and `x` is 75001. Otherwise, `L` is 1, `R` is 50001, `numCuts` is 1, and `x` is 25001.**
