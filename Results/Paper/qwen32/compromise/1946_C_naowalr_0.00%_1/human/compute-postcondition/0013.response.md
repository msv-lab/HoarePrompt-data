The code reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This changes the values of `a` and `b` based on the input provided. The other variables (`adj`, `n`, `k`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` contains `b`, and the list at index `b` contains `b` and `a`; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is an integer such that 0 < k < n; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input; `i` is 4.**
