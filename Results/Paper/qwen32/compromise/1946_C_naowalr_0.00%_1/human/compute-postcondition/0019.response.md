The code snippet initializes a variable `numCuts` to 0. This does not affect the values of `adj`, `n`, `k`, `L`, or `R`. The values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the vertices `b` that are directly connected to `a` by an edge; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is an integer such that 0 < k < n; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001; `numCuts` is 0.**
