The code appends the value of `a` to the list at index `b` in the adjacency list `adj`. Given the initial state, the list at index `b` already contains `b` and `a`. After appending `a` again, the list at index `b` will contain `b`, `a`, and `a` (if `a` was not already present twice).

However, since the problem specifies that the list at index `b` initially contains `b` and `a`, appending `a` again would result in the list having `b` and `a` twice. But typically, adjacency lists do not have duplicate entries for the same edge, so we assume the list remains with unique entries.

Thus, the list at index `b` will remain `[b, a]` if `a` was already present, or it will become `[b, a, a]` if duplicates are allowed. Given typical adjacency list behavior, we'll assume no duplicates, so the list remains `[b, a]`.

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but since `i` is not used in the given code snippet, its exact value is not specified beyond being incremented.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` contains `b`, and the list at index `b` contains `b` and `a`; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is an integer such that 0 < k < n; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1.**
