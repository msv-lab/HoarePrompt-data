The code reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This does not affect the variables `adj`, `n`, or `k`.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= `k` < `n`; `t` is the integer read from the standard input.**
