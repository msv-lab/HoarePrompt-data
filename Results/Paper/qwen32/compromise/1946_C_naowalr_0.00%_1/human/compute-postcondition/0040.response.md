The code snippet assigns the value of `x` to `L`. Given that `x` is 25001, `L` will now also be 25001. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the vertices `b` that are directly connected to `a` by an edge; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is an integer such that 0 < k < n; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `numCuts` is 0; `L` is 25001; `R` is 50001; `x` is 25001.**
