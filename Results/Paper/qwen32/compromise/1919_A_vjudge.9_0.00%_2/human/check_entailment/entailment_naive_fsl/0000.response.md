Let's analyze the provided program and verify if it correctly implements the game logic described in the problem statement.

### Problem Recap
- Alice and Bob take turns playing a game.
- Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
- They must remove one coin from their current wallet.
- The player who cannot make a move loses.
- Both players play optimally.

### Key Insight
The game can be analyzed by considering the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins \(a + b\):
- If \(a + b\) is even, Bob wins.
- If \(a + b\) is odd, Alice wins.

### Explanation
- If the total number of coins is even, Alice will eventually be forced into a position where she cannot make a move, assuming both play optimally. This is because she will always be the one to make the last move that results in an odd number of coins, and Bob will always be able to make a move that results in an even number of coins.
- Conversely, if the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position where he cannot make a move.

### Provided Program Analysis
The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: Determines the winner based on the parity of \(a + b\).
2. `func_2()`: Handles input and output for multiple test cases.

#### Function `func_1(a, b)`
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        return 'Bob'
    else:
        return 'Alice'
```
- This function correctly implements the key insight: it checks if the sum of coins \(a + b\) is even or odd and returns the appropriate winner.

#### Function `func_2()`
```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        winner = func_1(a, b)
        results.append(winner)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```
- This function correctly handles multiple test cases by reading input, processing each test case using `func_1`, and printing the results.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all potential cases based on the parity of the total number of coins. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins \(a + b\). It handles multiple test cases and provides the correct output for every possible scenario.
