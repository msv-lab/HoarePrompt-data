### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the initial number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key insight is that the game's outcome depends on whether the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd.

If the sum of the coins `(a + b)` is even, the game will end with Bob winning if both play optimally. This is because Alice will always be forced into a losing position if she starts with an even sum of coins.

If the sum of the coins `(a + b)` is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position, ensuring her victory.

The provided program correctly implements this logic. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, computes the sum, and determines the winner based on the parity of the sum. It then stores the result and prints it out after processing all test cases.
