### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies the winning strategy based on the parity of the total number of coins `(a + b)`. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Game Analysis:**
   - Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first.
   - Each turn involves an optional swap of wallets and then removing one coin from the current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Optimal Play:**
   - The game is symmetric, and the key to determining the winner is the parity of the total number of coins `(a + b)`.
   - If `(a + b)` is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring Bob wins.
   - If `(a + b)` is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves an even number of coins for Bob, ensuring Alice wins.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program consists of two functions:
     - `func_1(a, b)`: Determines the winner based on the total number of coins `(a + b)`.
     - `func_2()`: Handles input and output for multiple test cases.

4. **Logic in `func_1(a, b)`:**
   - If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, the function returns `'Bob'`, indicating Bob wins.
   - Otherwise, it returns `'Alice'`, indicating Alice wins.

5. **Validation Using Annotated Code:**
   - The annotations confirm that the function `func_1(a, b)` correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of `(a + b)`.
   - The annotations also confirm that the function `func_2()` correctly processes multiple test cases and outputs the results.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the total number of coins `(a + b)`. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final:
Final: **True**
