To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze the logic provided for determining the winner of the game.

The key part of the program is in `func_1(a, b)`, which determines the winner based on the sum of the coins in both wallets. Specifically, the function returns 'Bob' if the sum of coins `(a + b)` is even, and 'Alice' if the sum is odd.

Let's analyze the game rules and the logic to see if this approach is correct:

1. **Game Rules Recap:**
   - Players take turns.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or not, and then must take one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The game can be analyzed using the concept of "winning" and "losing" positions.
   - A "winning" position is one where the player whose turn it is can force a win.
   - A "losing" position is one where any move the player makes will leave the opponent in a winning position.

3. **Analyzing the Game:**
   - If both wallets have an even number of coins, the first player (Alice) can always make a move that leaves an odd number of coins in total (by swapping or not swapping and taking one coin). This forces the second player (Bob) into a "losing" position.
   - Conversely, if the total number of coins is odd, the first player can always make a move that leaves an even number of coins for the second player, putting Bob in a "losing" position.
   - This pattern continues until one player is unable to make a move (i.e., both wallets have 0 coins).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The game essentially reduces to whether the total number of coins `(a + b)` is even or odd.
   - If `(a + b)` is even, Bob wins.
   - If `(a + b)` is odd, Alice wins.

The logic in `func_1(a, b)` correctly implements this reasoning by checking the parity of the sum of the coins. Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description and the analysis above.

**Correctness: True**
