The code snippet reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, such that 1 <= a <= 10^9 and 1 <= b <= 10^9; `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**
