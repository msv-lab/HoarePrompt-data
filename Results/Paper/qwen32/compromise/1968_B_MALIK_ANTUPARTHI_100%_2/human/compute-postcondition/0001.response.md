The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `b` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

So, for the loop to execute, `a` must be greater than 0. The initial value of `i` is not a concern here because it is set to 0 at the start of the loop regardless of its initial value.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is a binary string of length `m`.**
