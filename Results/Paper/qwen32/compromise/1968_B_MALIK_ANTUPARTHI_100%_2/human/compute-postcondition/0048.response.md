The code snippet provided is `k = j`. This line assigns the value of `j` to `k`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the value of `k` is updated to the value of `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is at least 1, `c` is the second integer read from input, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the new string read from input, `j` equals `b` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking early, otherwise `j` is the value at which the loop breaks, `k` is equal to `j`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`**.
