Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `c` is an integer read from input; `d` is an input string; `e` is a string read from input. If `d[j]` is found in the substring `e[k:]`, then `k` is updated to `j + 1` if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, and the control breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is set to `j`, and the character `d[j]` is not found in the substring `e[k:]`. The control also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement in this case.**
