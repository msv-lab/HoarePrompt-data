Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer read from input; `c` is an integer read from input; `d` is an input string; `e` is a string read from input; `k` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(b):
    if d[j] in e[k:]:
        k = e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k
        if k == c or j == b - 1:
            k = j + 1
            break
    else:
        k = j
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `c` is an integer read from input; `d` is an input string; `e` is a string read from input. If `d[j]` is found in the substring `e[k:]`, then `k` is updated to `j + 1` if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, and the control breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is set to `j`, and the character `d[j]` is not found in the substring `e[k:]`. The control also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement in this case.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `c` is an integer read from input; `d` is an input string; `e` is a string read from input; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then if `k == c` or `j == b - 1`, `k` is set to `j + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to the previous value of `j` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `c` is an integer read from input; `d` is an input string; `e` is a string read from input; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, `k` becomes `j + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to the previous value of `j` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
