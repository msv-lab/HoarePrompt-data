The code snippet `a = int(input())` assigns the integer value of the user's input to the variable `a`. The previous state of `a` being a binary string is overwritten by this new assignment. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `b`, and the conditions on their ranges remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer; `b` is a binary string of length `m`. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of all `m` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.**
