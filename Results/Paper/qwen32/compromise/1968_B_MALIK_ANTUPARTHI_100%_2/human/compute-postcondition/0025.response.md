The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `b`. If `j` is less than `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was incremented by 1 from its previous value. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `c` is an integer read from input; `d` is an input string; `e` is a string read from input; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then if `k == c` or `j == b - 1`, `k` is set to `j + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to the previous value of `j` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust `j` to be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `c` is an integer read from input; `d` is an input string; `e` is a string read from input; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, so `j` is now 4 (assuming `j` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration); If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then if `k == c` or `j == b - 1`, `k` is set to `j + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to the previous value of `j` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

To generalize, if `j` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `c` is an integer read from input; `d` is an input string; `e` is a string read from input; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then if `k == c` or `j == b - 1`, `k` is set to `j + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to the previous value of `j` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Given that `j` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we adjust `j` accordingly:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `c` is an integer read from input; `d` is an input string; `e` is a string read from input; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, so `j` is now `j + 1`; If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then if `k == c` or `j == b - 1`, `k` is set to `j + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to the previous value of `j` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Since we do not have the exact value of `j` at the previous iteration, we express the state with `j` incremented by 1:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `c` is an integer read from input; `d` is an input string; `e` is a string read from input; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then if `k == c` or `j == b - 1`, `k` is set to `j + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to the previous value of `j` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `c` is an integer read from input; `d` is an input string; `e` is a string read from input; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value;**

Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `c` is an integer read from input; `d` is an input string; `e` is a string read from input; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, so `j` is now `j + 1`.** 

Given the previous state, `j` was incremented by 1, so:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `c` is an integer read from input; `d` is an input string; `e` is a string read from input; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, so `j` is now `j + 1`.**

Since `j` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is now `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `c` is an integer read from input; `d` is an input string; `e` is a string read from input; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**

Since `j` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤
