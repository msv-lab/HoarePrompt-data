The code snippet `k = j + 1` updates the value of `k` by setting it to `j + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is the first integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `c` is the second integer read from input; `d` is the new input string; `e` is the new string read from input; `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `j` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 2; `k` is `j + 1`.**
