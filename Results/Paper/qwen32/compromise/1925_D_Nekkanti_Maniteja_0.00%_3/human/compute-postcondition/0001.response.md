The code takes a single input line that contains three integers separated by spaces. These integers are then unpacked into the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The precondition that `input()` must be an integer greater than or equal to 1 is still valid for each of the integers in the input line.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where `n` is the first integer, `m` is the second integer, and `k` is the third integer from the input line. The input line consists of three integers separated by spaces, each of which is greater than or equal to 1.**
