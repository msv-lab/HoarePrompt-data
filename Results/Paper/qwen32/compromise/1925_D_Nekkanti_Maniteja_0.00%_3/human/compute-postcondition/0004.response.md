The given code snippet initializes a variable `s` to 0. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this code snippet. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where `n` is the first integer, `m` is the second integer, and `k` is the third integer from the input line; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`; `s` is 0.**
