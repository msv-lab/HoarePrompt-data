Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` remain unchanged; `s` is updated to `s + 2 * c * i * m + 2 * c * a`; `i` is 3; `M` remains 10; `c` remains the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo 10; `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input over the `m` iterations; `k` must be greater than 3.**

Natural language explanation: The value of `s` is updated by adding `2 * c * i * m + 2 * c * a` to its previous value. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `i`, `M`, `c`, and `a` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
