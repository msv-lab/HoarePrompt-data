To determine the new value of `s`, we will use the given expression and the initial state information.

The expression is:
```
s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
```

Given:
- `i` is now 0
- `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided in the `m` iterations
- `n`, `m`, `M`, `c` remain the same

Let's substitute the known values into the expression:
- `i` is 0, so `c * i * c * m` becomes `c * 0 * c * m` which is 0.
- The expression simplifies to `s = s + 0 + c * a` which further simplifies to `s = s + c * a`.

Thus, the new value of `s` is `s + c * a`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `M`, `c` remain the same; `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided in the `m` iterations; `k` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `s` is `s + c * a`.**
