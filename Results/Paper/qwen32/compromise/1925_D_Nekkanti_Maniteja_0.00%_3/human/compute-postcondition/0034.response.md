The code snippet `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. This means the initial values of `u`, `v`, and `f` provided by the user are overwritten by the new values read from the input. The other variables (`m`, `a`, and `i`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1, `u`, `v`, and `f` are the integers provided by the new input, `a` is increased by `f`, `i` is 1**.
