The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. The initial state specifies that `m` must be greater than `i + 1` and `i` is `i + 1`. These conditions remain unchanged by the code snippet, so they are still valid in the output state.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than `i + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers read from the input.**
