The code snippet assigns a specific value to the variable `M`, which is `10 ** 9 + 7`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `s`, `i`, `c`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input; `s` is `s + c * a * k + c * c * m * (k-1) * k / 2`; `i` is incremented by 1; `M` is `10 ** 9 + 7`; `c` and `a` remain the same.**
