Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and `m` friendship pairs with associated friendship values. For each test case, it computes and prints a result based on these inputs, specifically a value derived from the sum of friendship values and the threshold `k`, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).**
