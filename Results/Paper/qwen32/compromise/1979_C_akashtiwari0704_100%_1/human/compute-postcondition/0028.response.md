The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs `-1` directly. The initial state provides several variables and conditions, but none of them influence the value being printed by the `print(-1)` statement. The value `-1` is explicitly specified in the print statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state describes various variables (`t`, `T`, `g`, `l`, `bets`, `a`, `prod`, `sumo`), but none of these are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print(-1)` statement directly outputs the integer `-1`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply `-1`.

Output: **-1**
