Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is `len(l) - 1`, `bets` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input with the last element modified to `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the LCM of all elements in `a`, `sumo` is `int(a[i])`**.

In simple terms, the value of `sumo` is now the integer value of the last element of the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
