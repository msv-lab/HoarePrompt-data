Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 1, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `bets` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input with the `i`-th element updated to `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the LCM of all elements in `a` before the modification, `sumo` is `sumo + (prod // a[0])`, `i` is 0, and `a[0] is `prod // a[0]`**

Explanation: The code `a[i] = prod // a[i]` is executed, but `i` is 0 and `a[0]` is already defined as `prod // a[0]`. Therefore, the value of `a[0]` does not change. All other variables remain unchanged as well.
