The code snippet provided appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the variable `ans`. It also increments the variable `i` by 1. The precondition that `bets` must be greater than `i + 1` remains valid as the code does not affect the value of `bets`. The value of `ans` is updated to include the new string, and `i` is incremented.

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than `i + 1`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space, `i` is incremented by 1.**
