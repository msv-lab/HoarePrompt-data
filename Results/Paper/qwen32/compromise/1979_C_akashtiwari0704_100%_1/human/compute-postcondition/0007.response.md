The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the list `l`. Since the loop iterates over the indices of the list `l` using `range(len(l))`, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration is `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The list `l` does not need to be adjusted because the loop condition depends on the length of `l` and the current value of `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is `l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1])`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is 2**
