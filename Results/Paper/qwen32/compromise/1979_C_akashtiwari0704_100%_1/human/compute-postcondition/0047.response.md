Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 1, `g` is `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `bets` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where the first `bets` elements are modified to `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the LCM of all elements in `a`, `sumo` is the sum of the first `bets` modified elements of `a`, `i` is 2**

Explanation: The value of `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
