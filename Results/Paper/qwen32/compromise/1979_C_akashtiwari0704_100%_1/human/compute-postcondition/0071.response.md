The code snippet `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the `ans` string. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so `a[i]` is `a[0]`, which is `prod // a[0]`. This means that `ans` will now contain the string representation of `prod // a[0]` followed by a space.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 1, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `bets` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers where the first element is `prod // a[0]`, `prod` is the LCM of all elements in `a` before the modification, `sumo` is `bets * (prod // a[0])`, `i` is 0, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is `'str(prod // a[0]) '`**.
