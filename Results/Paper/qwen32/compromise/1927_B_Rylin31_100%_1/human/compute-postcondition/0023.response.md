To determine the output state, we need to consider the given code snippet and how it affects the variables:

The code snippet is:
```python
s[j] += 1
```

This line increments the value at index `j` in the list `s` by 1.

Given:
- `t` is 1
- `l` is an input integer
- `s` is a list of `l` zeros
- `array` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element
- `ans` is 'a'
- `i` is `i + 1` (Note: This seems to be a typo or logical error since `i` is not defined before this line. Assuming it's a variable that should be defined or incremented elsewhere, we will focus on the given line.)

The only variable that gets modified here is `s[j]`, where `j` is presumably an index into the list `s`. Since the initial state specifies that `s` is a list of `l` zeros, the value at index `j` will be 1 after the operation.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros except `s[j]` is 1, `array` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `ans` is 'a', `i` is `i + 1`**.

In natural language: The value at index `j` in the list `s` is now 1, while all other elements in `s` remain zeros. All other variables retain their initial values.
