The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `array`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is the last element of `array` that was processed, and `array` must have at least one element. For the loop to execute again, there must be another element in `array` that has not yet been processed.

Since `j` is the last element processed, it should now be set to the next element in `array`. However, the exact value of `j` at the start of the next iteration is not specified, only that it will take the value of the next element in `array`.

State: **`t` is 1, `l` is the new input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros except `s[j]` which is 1, `array` must have more than one element, `ans` is `'a'`, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is the next element in `array`**
