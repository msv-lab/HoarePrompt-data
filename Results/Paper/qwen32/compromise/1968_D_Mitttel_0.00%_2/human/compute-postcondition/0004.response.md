The code snippet assigns the value `-1` to the variable `cycle_start`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`start_pos` is an integer representing the starting position in the permutation, 1 <= `start_pos` <= n; `score` is 0; `current_pos` is equal to `start_pos`; `steps` is 0; `visited` is an empty dictionary; `cycle_start` is -1.**
