The code snippet initializes a variable `score` to 0. This does not affect the value of `start_pos`, which remains an integer representing the starting position in the permutation, with the precondition that 1 <= start_pos <= n still holding true.

Output State: **`start_pos` is an integer representing the starting position in the permutation, 1 <= `start_pos` <= n; `score` is 0.**
