The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `steps` to 0. This does not affect the existing variables `start_pos`, `score`, or `current_pos`. Therefore, the values of `start_pos`, `score`, and `current_pos` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start_pos` is an integer representing the starting position in the permutation, 1 <= `start_pos` <= n; `score` is 0; `current_pos` is equal to `start_pos`; `steps` is 0.**
