To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `steps < k`. 

Here's the given state right before the `while` loop:
- `start_pos` is an integer representing the starting position in the permutation, 1 <= `start_pos` <= n
- `score` is 0
- `current_pos` is equal to `start_pos`
- `steps` is 0
- `visited` is an empty dictionary
- `cycle_start` is -1

The loop condition is `steps < k`, where `k` is not explicitly provided in the given state. To ensure that the loop can execute at least once, `steps` must be less than `k`. Since `steps` is initialized to 0, `k` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `k` is greater than 0. No other variables in the loop head condition need to be adjusted.

State: **`start_pos` is an integer representing the starting position in the permutation, 1 <= `start_pos` <= n; `score` is 0; `current_pos` is equal to `start_pos`; `steps` is 0; `visited` is an empty dictionary; `cycle_start` is -1; `k` must be greater than 0**
