Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and the second line contains a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is either 0 or 1. At least one a_i is 1 in each test case.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of an integer input by the user, which is expected to be between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The other conditions and variables (n, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) remain unchanged as the input for those has not yet been processed.
