Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of elements in the list, where 2 <= n <= 50, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is either 0 or 1, and at least one `a_i` is 1. The function returns the index of the first occurrence of the integer 1 in each test case.**
