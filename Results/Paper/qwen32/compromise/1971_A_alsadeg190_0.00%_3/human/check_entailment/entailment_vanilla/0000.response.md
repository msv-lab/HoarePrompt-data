Reasoning:  
The given program is supposed to read multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers, and then output the minimum and maximum of those two integers for each test case. However, there is a logical error in the provided program. The program currently prints the larger number first and the smaller number second in the `if` and `else` clauses. This is the opposite of what is required according to the problem description.

The correct approach should be:
- For each test case, read the two integers.
- Compare the two integers.
- Print the smaller integer first, followed by the larger integer.

The current implementation does the following:
- For each test case, read the two integers.
- Compare the two integers.
- If the first integer is larger, print the first integer first, followed by the second integer.
- Otherwise, print the second integer first, followed by the first integer.

This results in the outputs being reversed compared to what is required.

Correctness: **False**
