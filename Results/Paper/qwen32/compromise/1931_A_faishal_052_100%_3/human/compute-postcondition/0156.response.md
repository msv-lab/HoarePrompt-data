The code appends a new character to the `temp` string. This character is derived from the ASCII value of `info[i][j] + 96`. Given the initial state, `i` is 4 and `j` is 1, so the new character appended to `temp` is `chr(info[4][1] + 96)`. 

Thus, the updated `temp` string will be the original `temp` concatenated with `chr(info[4][1] + 96)`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, `lex` is adjusted based on the described rules for each test case, `temp` is a string containing the characters `chr(info[4][3] + 96)`, `chr(info[4][0] + 96)`, and `chr(info[4][1] + 96)`, `j` is 1, `i` is 4**.
