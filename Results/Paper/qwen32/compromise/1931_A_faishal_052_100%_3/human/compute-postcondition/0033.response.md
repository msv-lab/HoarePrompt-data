The code attempts to append the value `26` to a list named `arr`. However, the initial state does not mention the existence of `arr`. Since `arr` is not defined, this code would raise a `NameError` in Python. Given the constraints and the information provided, we'll assume there was a typo or missing initialization, and we'll proceed by assuming `arr` was intended to be `info` since `info` is the only list mentioned in the initial state.

Thus, the value `26` will be appended to the `info` list.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing [26], `j` is 2**.
