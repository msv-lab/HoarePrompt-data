The only variable in the loop head is `j`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to 2 (inclusive), meaning it will execute when `j` is 0, 1, and 2. Since the state at the end of the previous iteration shows `j` is 3, the loop condition is no longer satisfied, and the loop does not execute again.

However, if we were to consider the scenario where we are about to start the loop or are resetting for another potential execution, we would adjust `j` to the starting value of the range, which is 0.

Given the task constraints, we only adjust `j`:

State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, `lex` is adjusted based on the described rules for each test case, `temp` is a string containing the character `chr(info[4][3] + 96)`, `j` is 0, `i` is 4**
