The code snippet reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `cases`. This integer represents the number of test cases, which was previously described as `t` in the initial state. The value of `t` is now replaced by the value read from the input and stored in `cases`.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, and for each of the `cases` test cases, there is an integer `n` such that 3 <= `n` <= 78.**
