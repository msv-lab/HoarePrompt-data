The code appends the integer `26` to the sublist `arr` within the list `info`. The values of `cases`, `lex`, and `j` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr` with `26` appended to it, `lex` is an integer, and `j` is 0.**
