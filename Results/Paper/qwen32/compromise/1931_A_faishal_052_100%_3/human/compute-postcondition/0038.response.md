Postcondition: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `j` is 2, and `info` is a list containing [26] if `lex` was initially less than 52 or if `lex` was initially between 52 and 78 inclusive. If `lex` was initially greater than 78, `info` remains an empty list. If `lex` was initially between 52 and 78 inclusive, `lex` is updated to `lex_initial - 26`.**
