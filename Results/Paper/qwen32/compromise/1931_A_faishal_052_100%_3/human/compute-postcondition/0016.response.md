Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is an empty list, `arr` is a list containing the integer 26, `lex` is an integer and 26 <= `lex` <= 52.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `lex` has been decreased by 26, so if `lex` was originally between 52 and 78 (inclusive), it is now between 26 and 52 (inclusive). All other variables remain unchanged.
