The code appends the value `26` to the list `arr`. This affects the second sublist of `info` since it contains `arr`. The first sublist of `info` remains unchanged because `lex` was appended to the sorted version of `arr` before this operation.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing two sublists (the first being the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it, and the second being `arr` with `26` appended to it), `j` is 1, `i` is 2**.
