Postcondition: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing two sublists (the first being the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it, and the second being `arr`), `lex` is the integer value obtained from the input, `j` is 0, `i` is 2. If `lex` is less than or equal to 78, `lex` is reduced by 26 and `arr` becomes [26]. Otherwise, `arr` remains an empty list.**
