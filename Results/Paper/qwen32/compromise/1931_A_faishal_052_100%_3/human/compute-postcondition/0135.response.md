The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 3. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, `lex` is adjusted based on the described rules for each test case, `temp` is a string containing the characters `chr(info[i][0] + 96)` and `chr(info[i][1] + 96)`, `j` is 2**
