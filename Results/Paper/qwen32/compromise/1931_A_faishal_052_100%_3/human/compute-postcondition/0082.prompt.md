Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr`, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer, `i` is `i + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex < 28:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    elif lex <= 78:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr`, `lex` is an integer, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `lex` was initially less than 28, `lex` is now `lex - 1` and `arr` is [1]. If `lex` was initially 28 or more, `arr` is [26] if `lex` is less than 52 or between 52 and 78 inclusive, and `arr` remains an empty list if `lex` is greater than 78.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr` with an additional element `1` appended to it if `lex` < 28, or with `26` appended to it if 28 <= `lex` <= 78, or unchanged if `lex` > 78, `lex` is `lex - 1` if `lex` < 28, `lex - 26` if 28 <= `lex` < 52 or 52 < `lex` <= 78, or unchanged if `lex` > 78, and `j` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr` with an additional `1` appended if `lex` < 28, `26` appended if 28 <= `lex` <= 78, or unchanged if `lex` > 78, `lex` is adjusted to `lex - 1` if `lex` < 28, `lex - 26` if 28 <= `lex` < 52, `lex - 52` if 52 <= `lex` < 78, or remains unchanged if `lex` > 78, and `j` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
