The code appends the integer `1` to the list `arr`. Since `arr` was initially an empty list, after appending `1`, `arr` now contains one element `[1]`. The other variables (`cases`, `info`, `lex`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr` where `arr` is [1], `lex` is an input integer and `lex` is less than 28, `i` is `i + 1`.**
