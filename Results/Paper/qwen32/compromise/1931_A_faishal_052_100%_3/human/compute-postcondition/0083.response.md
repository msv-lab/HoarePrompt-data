The code appends the value of `lex` to the sublist `arr` within the list `info`. Since `arr` was initially the only sublist in `info`, after appending `lex`, `arr` will contain its original elements plus `lex` as the last element.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr` with `lex` appended to it, `lex` is adjusted based on the initial value of `lex` as described above, and `j` is 1.**

In simpler terms, `arr` now includes `lex` as its last element, while `cases`, `lex`, and `j` remain unchanged.
