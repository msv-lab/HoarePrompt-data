Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is an empty list, `lex` is an integer, `arr` is a list containing the element 1, `j` is 1.**

Explanation: The only change is that the list `arr` now contains the element `1`. All other variables retain their initial values.
