The code appends the integer `1` to the list `arr`. Since `arr` is part of the `info` list, appending to `arr` will also modify the second sublist of `info`. The values of `cases`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing two sublists (the first being the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it, and the second being `arr` with `1` appended to it), `j` is 1, `i` is 2**.
