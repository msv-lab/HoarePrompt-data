To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop behaves and how many iterations it will perform based on the given conditions.

The loop iterates over `range(2)`, meaning it will execute exactly 2 times, regardless of the value of `lex`. Therefore, the loop will always run 2 iterations, not 3 as mentioned in the problem statement (which seems to be a typo).

Let's analyze the behavior of the loop for each iteration:

1. **First Iteration:**
   - If `lex < 28`, `arr` becomes `[1]` and `lex` becomes `lex - 1`.
   - If `28 <= lex < 52`, `arr` becomes `[26]` and `lex` becomes `lex - 26`.
   - If `52 <= lex <= 78`, `arr` becomes `[26]` and `lex` becomes `lex - 26`.

2. **Second Iteration:**
   - The same logic applies as the first iteration, but now the new value of `lex` from the first iteration is used.
   - If `lex < 28`, `arr` becomes `[1, 1]` and `lex` becomes `lex - 1`.
   - If `28 <= lex < 52`, `arr` becomes `[26, 26]` and `lex` becomes `lex - 26`.
   - If `52 <= lex <= 78`, `arr` becomes `[26, 26]` and `lex` becomes `lex - 26`.

After these two iterations, the final state of `arr` and `lex` will depend on the initial value of `lex`.

### Final Output State Analysis:

- If the initial `lex` is less than 28:
  - After the first iteration, `arr` is `[1]` and `lex` is `lex - 1`.
  - After the second iteration, `arr` is `[1, 1]` and `lex` is `lex - 2`.

- If the initial `lex` is between 28 and 51:
  - After the first iteration, `arr` is `[26]` and `lex` is `lex - 26`.
  - After the second iteration, `arr` is `[26, 26]` and `lex` is `lex - 52`.

- If the initial `lex` is between 52 and 78:
  - After the first iteration, `arr` is `[26]` and `lex` is `lex - 26`.
  - After the second iteration, `arr` is `[26, 26]` and `lex` is `lex - 52`.

- If the initial `lex` is greater than 78:
  - After the first iteration, `arr` remains `[]` and `lex` remains unchanged.
  - After the second iteration, `arr` remains `[]` and `lex` remains unchanged.

Given the loop runs exactly 2 times, the final output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr`, `lex` is adjusted based on the initial value of `lex` as described above, and `j` is 1.**

In natural language, the final output state means that `cases` remains within its initial bounds, `arr` will either be `[1, 1]` if `lex` was initially less than 28, or `[26, 26]` if `lex` was initially between 28 and 78, or `[]` if `lex` was initially greater than 78. The variable `lex` will be adjusted according to the rules specified for each range, and `j` will be 1 since the loop runs 2 times.
