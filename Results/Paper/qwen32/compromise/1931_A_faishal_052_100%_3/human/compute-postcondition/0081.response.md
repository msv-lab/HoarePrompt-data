Postcondition: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr` with an additional `1` appended if `lex` < 28, `26` appended if 28 <= `lex` <= 78, or unchanged if `lex` > 78, `lex` is adjusted to `lex - 1` if `lex` < 28, `lex - 26` if 28 <= `lex` < 52, `lex - 52` if 52 <= `lex` < 78, or remains unchanged if `lex` > 78, and `j` is 1.**
