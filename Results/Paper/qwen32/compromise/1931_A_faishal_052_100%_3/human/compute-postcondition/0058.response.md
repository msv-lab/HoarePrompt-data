The value of `lex` is decremented by 26. Given that `lex` was originally between 52 and 78, after subtracting 26, `lex` will now be between 26 and 52. The values of `cases`, `info`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The expression `i = i + 1` does not affect the current state since there's no assignment operation in the provided code snippet affecting `i`.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr`, `arr` is [26], `lex` is an integer between 26 and 52, `i` is `i + 1`.**
