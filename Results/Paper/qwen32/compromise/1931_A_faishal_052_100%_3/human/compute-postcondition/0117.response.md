The code appends the value `26` to the list `arr`. This change affects the `info` list since it contains `arr` as one of its sublists. Specifically, the second sublist of `info` will now include the newly appended `26` unless `lex` was between 28 and 78 inclusive, in which case the second sublist would remain unchanged.

Given the conditions for `lex`:
- If `lex` was originally less than 28, it was decreased by 1, and the second sublist of `info` had `1` appended to it. After appending `26` to `arr`, the second sublist will now include both `1` and `26`.
- If `lex` was originally greater than 78, it was decreased by 26, and the second sublist of `info` had `26` appended to it. Appending another `26` to `arr` will result in the second sublist including two `26`s.
- If `lex` was between 28 and 78 inclusive, it was not altered, and the second sublist of `info` was simply `arr`. After appending `26` to `arr`, the second sublist will now include this new `26`.

The first sublist of `info` remains unchanged because it consists of the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it, and `arr` is only modified after `lex` is adjusted.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing two sublists (the first being the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it, and the second being `arr` with either [1, 26] appended to it if `lex` was originally less than 28, [26, 26] appended to it if `lex` was originally greater than 78, or just `arr` with `26` appended to it if 28 <= `lex` <= 78), `j` is 0, `i` is 2, and `lex` is decreased by 1 if `lex` was originally less than 28, otherwise `lex` is decreased by 26.**
