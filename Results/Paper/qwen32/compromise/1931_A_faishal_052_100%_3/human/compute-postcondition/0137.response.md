To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop operates. The loop iterates over a range of 3 (i.e., `j` takes values from 0 to 2). In each iteration, it appends a character to the `temp` string based on the value of `info[i][j]`.

Given that the loop runs exactly 3 times, the final `temp` string will contain the concatenation of three characters derived from `info[i][0]`, `info[i][1]`, and `info[i][2]`. Each character is obtained by converting the corresponding element in the sublist of `info` to its ASCII character equivalent using `chr(info[i][j] + 96)`.

Here's the final output state:

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, `lex` is adjusted based on the described rules for each test case, `temp` is a string containing the characters `chr(info[i][0] + 96)`, `chr(info[i][1] + 96)`, and `chr(info[i][2] + 96)`, `j` is 2.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `temp` will hold a string of three characters, each derived from the first three elements of the current sublist in `info`. The variable `j` will have the value 2, indicating that the loop has completed its third and final iteration. The values of `cases` and `info` remain unchanged as per the initial conditions, and `lex` is adjusted as per the rules mentioned but not detailed here.
