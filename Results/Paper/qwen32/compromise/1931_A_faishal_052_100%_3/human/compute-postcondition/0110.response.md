The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. The values of `cases`, `info`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing two sublists (the first being the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it, and the second being `arr` with `26` appended to it), `j` is 1, `i` is 2, `lex` is `lex - 26`.**
