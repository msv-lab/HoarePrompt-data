Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr` with an additional element `1` appended to it, `lex` is `lex - 1`, and `j` is 0.**
This means that the value of `lex` has been decremented by 1, while the values of `cases`, `info`, and `j` remain unchanged.
