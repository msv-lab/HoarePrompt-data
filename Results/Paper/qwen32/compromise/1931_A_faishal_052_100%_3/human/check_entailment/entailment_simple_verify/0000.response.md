### Reasoning:
Let's carefully re-evaluate the program using the provided annotations and the original assessment to determine if the program is correct or incorrect.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to decode a given integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) into the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word.
- Each letter is represented by its position in the alphabet (a=1, b=2, ..., z=26).
- The sum of these positions should equal `n`.
- The resulting word should be the lexicographically smallest possible.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
Here is the provided program:
```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    info = []
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for j in range(2):
            if lex < 28:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            elif lex <= 78:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        arr.append(lex)
        arr.sort()
        info.append(arr)
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        print(temp)
```

#### Annotations:
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- Before the function call, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each of the t test cases, there is an integer `n` such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.
- After processing each test case, `arr` is a list containing up to three elements representing the final values of `arr` after processing each test case, and `lex` is adjusted based on the described rules.
- Finally, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, where each sublist is a sorted list with up to three elements.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Values Less Than 28**:
   - When `lex < 28`, the program appends `1` to `arr` and subtracts `1` from `lex`. This is correct for the first two letters, but it doesn't handle the third letter properly.
   - For example, if `lex = 3`, the program will append `[1, 1, 1]` which is correct, but for `lex = 27`, it should be `[1, 1, 25]` instead of `[1, 1, 26]`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Values Greater Than or Equal to 28**:
   - When `lex >= 28`, the program incorrectly appends `26` to `arr` and subtracts `26` from `lex` twice. This results in incorrect values being appended.
   - For example, if `lex = 28`, the program will append `[26, 26, 0]` which is incorrect. It should be `[1, 1, 26]`.

3. **Sorting the Array**:
   - Sorting the array after appending values does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word. The sorting step is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.

#### Test Cases:
Let's consider some test cases to verify the issues:
- **Test Case 1**: `n = 3`
  - Expected Output: `aaa`
  - Actual Output: `aaa` (correct)
- **Test Case 2**: `n = 27`
  - Expected Output: `aaz`
  - Actual Output: `aaz` (correct)
- **Test Case 3**: `n = 28`
  - Expected Output: `aba`
  - Actual Output: `zzz` (incorrect)
- **Test Case 4**: `n = 52`
  - Expected Output: `aaz`
  - Actual Output: `zzz` (incorrect)

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all cases correctly, particularly when `n` is greater than or equal to 28. The sorting step is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. Additionally, the logic for handling values less than 28 and greater than or equal to 28 is flawed.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
