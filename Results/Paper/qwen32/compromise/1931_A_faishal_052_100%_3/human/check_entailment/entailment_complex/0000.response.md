### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which represents the encoded value of a 3-letter word.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the values corresponding to the letters of the word.
   - It then enters a loop that runs twice. In each iteration, it checks the value of `lex` (which is initially set to `n`):
     - If `lex` is less than 28, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`. This is incorrect because it should append the largest possible value (up to 26) that can still be part of the sum, not the smallest.
     - If `lex` is between 28 and 51, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This is correct for the first two letters.
     - If `lex` is between 52 and 78, it again appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This is also correct for the first two letters.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - It sorts the list `arr` to ensure the lexicographically smallest order.

3. **Generating Output:**
   - For each test case, it constructs a string by converting each element in `arr` to its corresponding character (using `chr(value + 96)`).
   - It prints the resulting string.

### Issues Identified:
- The logic for determining the values to append to `arr` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if lex < 28` is incorrect because it should always try to maximize the value of the first two letters while ensuring the total sum equals `n`.
- The sorting step is unnecessary if the values are already assigned in the correct lexicographical order.

### Correct Approach:
- To find the lexicographically smallest word, we should start by assigning the highest possible values to the last letter first, then the second last, and finally the first letter, ensuring that the sum equals `n`.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the logic of the program, it does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for each test case.

**Correctness: False**
