In the provided code snippet, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is an input integer. The loop variable is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that is not used within the loop body. Since the loop variable `_` does not affect the execution of the loop, the only variable in the loop head that we can adjust is `t`.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The state before the loop starts already specifies that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3`, which ensures that `t` is a positive integer and the loop can execute.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute. The state before the loop starts already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3**
