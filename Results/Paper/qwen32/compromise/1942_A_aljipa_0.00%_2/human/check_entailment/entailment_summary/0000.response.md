### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and compare it with the problem requirements:

1. **Case 1: \( k = n \)**
   - The program outputs an array of `n` ones. This is a valid solution because all cyclic shifts of an array consisting of identical elements (e.g., [1, 1, 1, 1]) are sorted. Hence, if \( k = n \), the program correctly outputs an array where all cyclic shifts are sorted.

2. **Case 2: \( k = 1 \)**
   - The program outputs an array that is a sequence from `0` to `n-1` (e.g., [0, 1, 2, 3]). This is also a valid solution because only one cyclic shift of such an array is sorted, specifically the original array itself. Hence, if \( k = 1 \), the program correctly outputs an array where exactly one cyclic shift is sorted.

3. **Case 3: \( 1 < k < n \)**
   - The program outputs `-1`. This is a valid response because the problem does not specify a way to construct an array that has exactly \( k \) sorted cyclic shifts for \( 1 < k < n \). The program correctly identifies that no such array exists for these values of \( k \).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all the specified cases in the problem description. For \( k = n \), it provides an array where all cyclic shifts are sorted. For \( k = 1 \), it provides an array where only one cyclic shift is sorted. For \( 1 < k < n \), it correctly identifies that no such array exists and returns `-1`.

### Correctness: **True**
