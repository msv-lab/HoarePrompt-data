### Reasoning:

The problem requires the generation of an array `a` such that exactly `k` out of its `n` cyclic shifts are sorted. The provided program handles three specific cases:

1. **When `k == n`:** The program outputs an array consisting of `n` ones (`[1, 1, ..., 1]`). This is correct because all cyclic shifts of this array will be identical and sorted.
2. **When `k == 1`:** The program outputs an array consisting of consecutive integers starting from `0` up to `n-1` (`[0, 1, ..., n-1]`). This is correct because there is exactly one cyclic shift (the array itself) that is sorted, and all others will have a larger number followed by a smaller number, making them unsorted.
3. **When `k` is neither `n` nor `1`:** The program outputs `-1`. This is correct because it is impossible to construct an array where exactly `k` cyclic shifts are sorted if `k` is neither `n` nor `1` (as per the problem constraints and the nature of cyclic shifts).

The program does not cover other potential values of `k` between `2` and `n-1`, but according to the problem statement, those cases have no valid solutions. Thus, the program adheres to the problem requirements for all possible input values.

### Correctness:
**True**
