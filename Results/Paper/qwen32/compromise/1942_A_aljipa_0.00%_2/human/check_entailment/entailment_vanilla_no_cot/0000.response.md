Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the logic:

1. **Case k == n**: The program correctly outputs an array with all elements equal (e.g., [1, 1, ..., 1]). This ensures that all cyclic shifts are the same and thus sorted.
   
2. **Case k == 1**: The program outputs an array [0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]. This ensures that only the first cyclic shift is sorted. However, the problem specifies that the elements must be between 1 and \(10^9\). The provided program generates an array starting from 0, which is not valid according to the problem constraints.

3. **Case k != 1 and k != n**: The program outputs -1, which is correct for some cases where no valid array exists. However, there are cases where a valid array can be constructed for k values between 1 and n, but the program does not handle these cases.

To fix the program, we need to make sure that the array elements are within the valid range (1 to \(10^9\)) and that the program can handle cases where k is between 1 and n appropriately. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = (int(i) for i in input().split())
        if k == n:
            # All elements equal
            res = [1] * n
        elif k == 1:
            # First shift sorted, others not
            res = list(range(1, n+1))
        else:
            # No valid array exists for these cases in the simple logic
            res = [-1]
        print(*res)

# The above code still needs further refinement for k values between 1 and n.
# Here is a more refined version:

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = (int(i) for i in input().split())
        if k == n:
            # All elements equal
            res = [1] * n
        elif k == 1:
            # First shift sorted, others not
            res = list(range(1, n+1))
        elif k == 2:
            # Special case for k = 2
            res = [1] * (n-1) + [2]
        else:
            # General case for 2 < k < n
            # We can construct an array with k sorted cyclic shifts
            res = [1] * (k-1) + list(range(k, n+1)) + [k]
        print(*res)

# This refined version handles more cases, but still might not cover all edge cases.
# A more robust solution would be needed to handle all possible cases correctly.
```

The program needs further refinement to handle all possible values of k between 1 and n correctly, especially when k is greater than 2. The current implementation does not cover all valid configurations for such cases.
