The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the values of `k`, `arr`, and `pos` do not affect whether the loop will execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The value of `i` is initialized by the `range` function and does not need to be set manually before the loop starts.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` and `arr` are the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively, `pos` is -1**
