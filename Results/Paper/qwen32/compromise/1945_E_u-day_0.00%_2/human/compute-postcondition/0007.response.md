To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the loop condition `low + 1 < high`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`.
- `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`.
- `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise `-1`.
- `low` is `0`.
- `high` is `n - 1`.
- `st` is an empty set.

The condition `low + 1 < high` must be true for the loop to execute. Let's analyze the variables involved in this condition:
- `low` is initialized to `0`.
- `high` is initialized to `n - 1`.

For the loop to execute, `low + 1 < high` must hold true. Substituting the initial values, we get:
- `0 + 1 < n - 1`
- `1 < n - 1`
- `2 < n`

Thus, `n` must be greater than `2` for the loop to execute. No other variables in the loop condition need to be adjusted as they are directly derived from `n`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than `2`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise `-1`, `low` is `0`, `high` is `n - 1`, `st` is an empty set**.
