To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's analyze the given code:

1. The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `n-1`.
2. For each iteration, it checks if the element at index `i` in the array `arr` is equal to `k`.
3. If the condition `arr[i] == k` is true, the variable `pos` is updated to the current index `i`.
4. If the condition is never met during the iterations, `pos` remains `-1`.

After the loop has finished, `pos` will hold the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found. If `k` is not found in `arr`, `pos` will remain `-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`
- `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`
- `pos` is `-1`

The output state will be:
- `n` and `k` remain the same as they are not modified in the loop.
- `arr` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop.
- `pos` will be the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise it will remain `-1`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise `-1`.**
