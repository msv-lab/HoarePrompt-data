To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly handles all the conditions described in the problem statement.

The program logic is as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cubes `n`, the index of the favorite cube `f`, and the number of cubes to be removed `k`.
3. It reads the list of values on the cubes.
4. It determines the value of the favorite cube.
5. It counts how many cubes have the same value as the favorite cube.
6. It counts how many cubes have a value greater than the favorite cube.
7. It then makes a decision based on these counts:
   - If the number of cubes with values greater than the favorite cube is at least `k`, it prints "YES" (since the favorite cube will definitely be removed).
   - If the sum of cubes with values greater than and equal to the favorite cube is less than or equal to `k`, it prints "NO" (since the favorite cube will definitely not be removed).
   - Otherwise, it prints "MAYBE" (since the favorite cube might or might not be removed depending on the exact order of cubes with the same value).

Let's verify if this logic covers all possible cases:

- **"YES" Case**: If there are at least `k` cubes with values greater than the favorite cube, the favorite cube will definitely be removed, which is correctly handled.
- **"NO" Case**: If the total number of cubes with values greater than or equal to the favorite cube is less than or equal to `k`, the favorite cube will definitely not be removed, which is correctly handled.
- **"MAYBE" Case**: If the number of cubes with values greater than the favorite cube is less than `k`, but the total number of cubes with values greater than or equal to the favorite cube is more than `k`, the favorite cube might or might not be removed depending on the exact order of cubes with the same value, which is correctly handled.

The provided program handles these cases correctly based on the described logic and the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
