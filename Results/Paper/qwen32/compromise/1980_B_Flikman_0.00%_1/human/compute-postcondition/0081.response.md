Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `favorite_value` is the integer at index `f - 1` in the new list `a`, `same_value_count` is 1 (since `value` equals `favorite_value`), `greater_count` is the total number of elements in the new list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`**
