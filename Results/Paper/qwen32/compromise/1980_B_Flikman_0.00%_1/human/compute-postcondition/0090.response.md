Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `favorite_value` is the integer at index `f - 1` in the new list `a`, `same_value_count` is the total number of elements in the list `a` that are equal to `favorite_value`, and `greater_count` is the total number of elements in the new list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed for all elements in the list `a`, `same_value_count` will hold the number of times the `favorite_value` appears in the list, and `greater_count` will hold the number of elements in the list that are greater than the `favorite_value`. The values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, and `favorite_value` remain unchanged from their initial state.
