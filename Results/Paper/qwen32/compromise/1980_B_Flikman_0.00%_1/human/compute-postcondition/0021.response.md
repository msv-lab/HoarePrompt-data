Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `favorite_value` is the integer at index `f - 1` in list `a`; `same_value_count` is the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in the list `a`. If `value` is greater than `favorite_value`, then `greater_count` is 1. Otherwise, `greater_count` remains 0.**
