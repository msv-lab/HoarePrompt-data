Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input, specifically `n`, `f`, and `k` are the three space-separated integers provided by the user.**

In simple terms, the variable `t` remains unchanged, while `n`, `f`, and `k` are assigned the values of the three integers provided by the user input.
