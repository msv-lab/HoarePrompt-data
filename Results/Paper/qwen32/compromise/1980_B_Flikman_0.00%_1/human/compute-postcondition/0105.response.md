Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). `n`, `f`, and `k` remain the integers obtained from the input. `a` remains the list of integers obtained from the input. `favorite_value` remains the integer at index `f - 1` in the list `a`. `same_value_count` remains the total number of elements in the list `a` that are equal to `favorite_value`. `greater_count` is the total number of elements in the list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`. Additionally, `greater_count` is less than `k`.**
