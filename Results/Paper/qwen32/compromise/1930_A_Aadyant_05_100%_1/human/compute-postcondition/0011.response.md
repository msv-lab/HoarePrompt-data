The only variables in the loop head are `str` and `list1`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `list1`. If `list1` has more elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `list1` has at least one element, and `str` is the last processed element of `list1`.

To execute one more time, `list1` must have at least two elements, and `str` should be the next element in `list1` after the previously processed one.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `s` is 0; `list2` is a list containing the integer value of `a`; `a` is a string provided by the user; `b` is a string provided by the user that, when split, results in a non-empty list; `list1` is a list of words obtained by splitting the string `b`, and `list1` must have at least two elements; `str` is the second element in `list1`**
