The provided code snippet only initializes an empty list named `final`. It does not modify any other variables or perform any operations on the input values. Therefore, the output state includes the initialized `final` list, and all other initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50), representing half the number of integers on the whiteboard. This is followed by a line containing 2`n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2`n`} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), which are the numbers written on the whiteboard. The total number of test cases, `t`, is given at the beginning and satisfies 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000; `n` is an input integer. `final` is an empty list.**
