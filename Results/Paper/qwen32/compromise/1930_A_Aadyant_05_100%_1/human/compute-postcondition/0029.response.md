The code snippet `list1 = []` reinitializes `list1` to an empty list, discarding its previous value which was a list of words obtained by splitting the string `b`. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `s` is 0; `list2` is an empty list; `a` is the user's input; `b` is a string provided by the user that, when split, results in a non-empty list; `list1` is an empty list; `str` is the last element in `list1` (which is now undefined since `list1` is empty); `final` contains the value of `s` appended to it; `num` is incremented by 1.**
