The code snippet provided is `final.append(s)`. This line appends the value of `s` to the list `final`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50.
- `s` is the sum of all integers at even indices in `list2`.
- `list2` is a sorted list of integers.
- `a` is the user's input.
- `b` is the new user's input string.
- `list1` is a list of substrings from `b`.
- `str` is undefined.
- `final` contains the value of `s` appended to it.
- `num` is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop.

The only change in the state after executing `final.append(s)` is that the value of `s` is appended to `final`. Therefore, `final` now contains the previous contents of `final` plus the new value `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `s` is the sum of all integers at even indices in `list2`; `list2` is a sorted list of integers; `a` is the user's input; `b` is the new user's input string; `list1` is a list of substrings from `b`; `str` is undefined; `final` contains the previous values of `final` plus `s`; `num` is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop.**
