Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers; `a` is `l[x]`; `b` is `float('inf')`; `c` is 0; and `l[x]` is greater than `b`**

Explanation: The value of `a` is updated to be `l[x]`. The conditions for `t`, `n`, `l`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Since `l[x]` was initially greater than both `a` and `b`, and now `a` is set to `l[x]`, `l[x]` is still greater than `b`.
