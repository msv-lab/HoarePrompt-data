Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is `float('inf')`; `b` is `float('inf')`; `c` is 0. Additionally, `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`. The current value of `a` is `l[x]` or remains `float('inf')` if `l[x]` is not less than `a`.**
