Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is `float('inf')`; `b` is `float('inf')`; `c` is 0. Since the if condition `a > b` is always false (both `a` and `b` are `float('inf')`), the else part is not executed, and the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
