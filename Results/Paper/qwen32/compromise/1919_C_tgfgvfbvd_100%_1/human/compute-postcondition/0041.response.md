The given code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means the variable `n` is updated to the value provided by the user input. The other variables (`t`, `l`, `a`, `b`, `c`) are not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is the smallest element in `l`; `b` is the second smallest element in `l` if it exists, otherwise `float('inf')`; `c` is the count of elements greater than the second smallest element.**
