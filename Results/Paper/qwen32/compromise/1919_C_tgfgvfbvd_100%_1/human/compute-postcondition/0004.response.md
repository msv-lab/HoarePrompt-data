The code snippet provided initializes a variable `c` to 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `a`, and `b`) are not altered by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is `float('inf')`; `b` is `float('inf')`; `c` is 0.**
