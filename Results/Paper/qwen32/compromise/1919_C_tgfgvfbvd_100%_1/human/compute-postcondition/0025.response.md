The code snippet `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged except for `c`. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `x` is `k + 1`; `a` is `l[x]`; If `a` (previous value) was greater than `b`, then `a` (previous value) is now the previous value of `b` and `b` is now the previous value of `a` (previous value), otherwise `a` and `b` remain unchanged; `c` is incremented by 1.**
