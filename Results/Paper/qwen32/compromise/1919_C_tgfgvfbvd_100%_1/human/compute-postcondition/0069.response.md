The code snippet `a, b = b, a` swaps the values of `a` and `b`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change in the state is the swapping of `a` and `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is greater than 0
- `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input
- `x` is `x + 1`

After the execution of the code snippet, the output state will be:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` remains greater than 0
- `l` remains the new list of integers obtained from the input
- `x` remains `x + 1`
- `a` and `b` have swapped values

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `x` is `x + 1`; `a` and `b` have swapped values.**
