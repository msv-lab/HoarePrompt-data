The code snippet provided sets the variable `c` to 0. No other variables are affected by this code. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a specific range, `n` is an integer from input, `l` is a list of integers from input, `a` and `b` are set to positive infinity, and `c` is initially the count of elements in `l` that are larger than both `a` and `b`. Since `a` and `b` are `float('inf')`, no elements in `l` can be larger than both, making `c` initially 0. Setting `c` to 0 again does not change its value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the integer obtained from the input; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is `float('inf')`; `b` is `float('inf')`; `c` is 0.**
