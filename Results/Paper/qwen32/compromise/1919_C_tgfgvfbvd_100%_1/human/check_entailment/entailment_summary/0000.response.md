### Reasoning:

The provided program's logic is not entirely aligned with the problem's requirements. The task is to split the array into two subsequences such that the sum of the penalties of these subsequences is minimized. The penalty of a subsequence is defined as the number of indices where the element at the current index is less than the element at the next index.

The given program, however, does not actually split the array into two subsequences. Instead, it seems to be counting the number of elements that are greater than both the smallest and the second smallest elements encountered so far. This does not necessarily minimize the penalty of the subsequences.

To solve the problem correctly, one approach is to sort the array and then consider splitting it in such a way that the penalty is minimized. A simple and effective strategy is to split the array after the longest non-decreasing subsequence, which can be found by iterating through the array and counting the number of times an element is greater than the previous one. This count gives the penalty for one subsequence, and the penalty for the other subsequence can be minimized to zero by placing all remaining elements in it.

The provided program does not implement this logic. Instead, it counts elements that are greater than both the smallest and the second smallest elements, which is not the same as minimizing the penalty of the subsequences.

### Correctness: **False**
