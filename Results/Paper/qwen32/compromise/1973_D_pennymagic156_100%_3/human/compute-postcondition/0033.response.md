To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the `while` loop head:

```
while cnt and l < n + 1:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions are true:
1. `cnt` is truthy (non-zero).
2. `l` is less than `n + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1 (not used in the loop condition, so no change needed).
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `k` must be at least 2.
- `v` remains unchanged (not used in the loop condition, so no change needed).
- `cnt` is `k - 2`.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`.

Let's analyze each part:

1. **Condition `cnt`:**
   - `cnt` is defined as `k - 2`. For `cnt` to be truthy, `k - 2` must be greater than 0, meaning `k` must be at least 3.
   - Since `k` must be at least 2, we need to adjust this to ensure `k` is at least 3.

2. **Condition `l < n + 1`:**
   - `l` is defined as `func_2() + 1`. We don't know the exact value of `func_2()`, but we know that `l` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Given `n` must be at least 2, `n + 1` must be at least 3.
   - Therefore, `l` must be less than 3. Since `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `func_2()` must return a value less than 2.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust `k` to be at least 3 and ensure that `func_2()` returns a value such that `l` is less than 3. However, since we cannot control the output of `func_2()`, we can only specify the necessary condition for `l`.

Thus, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `k` must be at least 3, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` must be less than 3**
