To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop condition: `cnt` and `l`.

The loop condition is `while cnt and l < n + 1:`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `cnt` is truthy (non-zero) and `l` is less than `n + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 3
- `n` is at least 5
- `k` is 2
- `v` remains unchanged
- `cnt` is 1
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`

Let's analyze the conditions:

1. **`cnt`**: Since `cnt` is 1, it is truthy, so no adjustment is needed for `cnt`.

2. **`l`**: The value of `l` is `func_2() + 1`. We need to ensure that `l < n + 1`. Given that `n` is at least 5, `n + 1` is at least 6. Therefore, `l` must be less than 6.

Since `l` is `func_2() + 1`, we need to ensure that `func_2() + 1 < 6`, which simplifies to `func_2() < 5`. However, without knowing the exact behavior of `func_2()`, we can only state that `l` must be less than 6.

Thus, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `l` is less than 6.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is at least 5, `k` is 2, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is 1, `l` must be less than 6**
