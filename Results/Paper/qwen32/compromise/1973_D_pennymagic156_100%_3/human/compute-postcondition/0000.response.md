The code snippet assigns the values returned by the function `func_3()` to the variables `n` and `k`. Since the specific implementation of `func_3()` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `n` and `k` after the assignment. However, we know that `n` and `k` will still be positive integers and that the condition \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\) will hold true if `func_3()` returns values that satisfy these constraints.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, which are positive integers satisfying \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).**
