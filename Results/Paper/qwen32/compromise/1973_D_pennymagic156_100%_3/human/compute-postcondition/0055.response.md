The code snippet reassigns the value of `l` using the expression `func_2() + 1`. Since the initial state specifies that `l` is initially `func_2() + 1` and must be less than 4, executing the same assignment does not change the value of `l` itself, only reaffirms its condition.

Therefore, the Output State remains consistent with the initial conditions for all variables except that the reaffirmation of `l` being `func_2() + 1` and less than 4 is explicitly stated again.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 3, `k` is 2, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` must be non-zero, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and must be less than 4**.
