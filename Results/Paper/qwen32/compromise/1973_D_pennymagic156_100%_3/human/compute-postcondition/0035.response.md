To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the line `l = func_2() + 1` on the existing variables. Since the function `func_2()` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine its exact return value. However, we can express the new value of `l` in terms of the return value of `func_2()`.

Given:
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be at least 2
- `k` must be at least 3
- `v` remains unchanged
- `cnt` is `k - 2`
- `l` must be less than 3

After executing `l = func_2() + 1`, the value of `l` changes. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are explicitly modified by the code.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `k` must be at least 3, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`**
