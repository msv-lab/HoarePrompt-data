To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the `while` loop condition: `cnt` and `l`.

Here's the `while` loop condition:
```python
while cnt and l < n + 1:
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means the loop will continue to execute as long as both `cnt` is truthy (non-zero) and `l` is less than `n + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be at least 3
- `k` is 2
- `v` remains unchanged
- `cnt` is 0
- `l` is `func_2() + 1` and must be less than 4

Let's analyze the conditions:

1. **`cnt`**: The loop requires `cnt` to be non-zero for the loop to execute. Since `cnt` is 0, we need to change it to a non-zero value.
2. **`l < n + 1`**: We know `l` is `func_2() + 1` and must be less than 4. Since `n` must be at least 3, `n + 1` is at least 4. Therefore, for `l < n + 1` to hold true, `l` must be less than 4, which aligns with the given condition.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `cnt` to a non-zero value. The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `v`, and the condition on `l` do not need to be changed further based on the loop condition.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 3, `k` is 2, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` must be non-zero, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and must be less than 4**
