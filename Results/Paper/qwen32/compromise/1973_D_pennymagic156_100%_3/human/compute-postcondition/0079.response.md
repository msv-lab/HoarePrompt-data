To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

- `i` is 3.
- `v` remains unchanged, but its specific value is not provided.
- `cnt` is 0, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `l` is initially described as `func_2() + 1`, but later it is stated to be equal to `n + 1`. Since `l` is not used in the print statement, this detail is irrelevant for determining the output.
- `n` is at least 5, but its exact value is not needed for the print statement.
- `k` is 2, but it is also not used in the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'! {i * v}', flush=True)
```

Given that `i` is 3 and `v` remains unchanged but its value is not specified, the expression `i * v` will evaluate to `3 * v`.

Therefore, the output will be a formatted string starting with `! ` followed by the result of `3 * v`.

Since the exact value of `v` is not provided, we cannot determine a numerical value for `3 * v`. However, we can express the output in terms of `v`.

Output: **! 3*v (where v is the value of v)**
