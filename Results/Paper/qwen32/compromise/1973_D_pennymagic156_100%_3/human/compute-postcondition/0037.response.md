To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop terminates. The loop continues as long as `cnt` is greater than 0 and `l` is less than `n + 1`.

From the provided information, we know that after each iteration:
- `cnt` decreases by 1.
- `l` is updated to `func_2() + 1`.

The loop will terminate when `cnt` reaches 0 or `l` becomes equal to or greater than `n + 1`. Given that `cnt` starts at `k` and decreases by 1 each iteration, the loop will execute exactly `k` times if `l` never reaches `n + 1` before `cnt` reaches 0.

After `k` iterations:
- `cnt` will be 0.
- `l` will have been updated `k` times to `func_2() + 1` in each iteration.

Since `func_2()` is not defined, we can't determine the exact value of `l` after `k` iterations, but we know it will be some value resulting from `func_2()` being called `k` times and adding 1 each time.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least `k`, `k` remains unchanged, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1` after `k` iterations.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `cnt` will be 0, indicating the loop has finished, and `l` will have been updated `k` times based on the function `func_2()`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, and `v`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
