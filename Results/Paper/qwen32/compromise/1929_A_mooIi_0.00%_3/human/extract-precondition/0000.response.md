Precondition: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the length of the array. This is followed by a line containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) which are the elements of the array. The total number of test cases, t, is between 1 and 500.**
