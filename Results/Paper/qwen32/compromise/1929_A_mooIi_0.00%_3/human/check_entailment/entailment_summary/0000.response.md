Reasoning:

The provided Python program does not compute the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. Instead, it sorts the array in ascending order and prints the sorted array. This is not the intended output.

The problem requires us to rearrange the elements of the array in such a way that the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n is maximized. To achieve this, we should arrange the array in either ascending or descending order because the maximum beauty is obtained when the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

However, the program simply sorts the array and prints it, which does not provide the maximum beauty. The correct approach would involve sorting the array and then computing the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

Given the mismatch between the program's functionality and the problem's requirements, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
