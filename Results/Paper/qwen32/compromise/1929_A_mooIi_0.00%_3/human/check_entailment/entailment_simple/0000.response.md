Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The task is to find the maximum beauty of the array, which is the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i - 1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). To maximize this beauty, the array should be sorted in ascending order, as this will maximize the positive differences between consecutive elements. However, the program does not calculate the beauty at all; instead, it sorts the array and prints it. The output format of the program does not match the expected output format, which should be a single integer representing the maximum beauty for each test case.

Correctness: **False**
