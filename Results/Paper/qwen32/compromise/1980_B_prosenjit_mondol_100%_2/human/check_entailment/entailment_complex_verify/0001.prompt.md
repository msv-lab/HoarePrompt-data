You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n, f, and k are integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100. a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 100.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives a list of integers `a` and two indices `f` and `k`. It then determines whether the element at index `f` (0-based) is among the top `k+1` largest elements in the list. It outputs 'YES' if the element is among the top `k+1` largest, 'NO' if it is not, and 'MAYBE' if it is the `k+1`-th largest and there are other elements equal to it.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input**: 
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of cubes.
     - `f`: Index of Dmitry's favorite cube (1-based index).
     - `k`: Number of cubes to be removed.
     - `a`: List of integers representing the values on the cubes.

2. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output one of the following:
     - "YES" if the favorite cube will be removed in all cases.
     - "NO" if the favorite cube will not be removed in any case.
     - "MAYBE" if the favorite cube may be either removed or left.

3. **Logic**:
   - The cubes are sorted in non-increasing order.
   - After sorting, the first `k` cubes are removed.
   - We need to determine the fate of the favorite cube based on its value and position relative to the `k`-th cube.

### Program Analysis:
The given program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads `n`, `f`, `k`, and the list `a`.
   - It adjusts `f` and `k` to be 0-based indices.
   - It stores the value of the favorite cube (`x = a[f]`).
   - It sorts the list `a` in non-increasing order.
   - It compares the value of the `k`-th cube (`a[k]`) with the favorite cube's value (`x`).
   - Based on the comparison, it prints:
     - "NO" if the `k`-th cube's value is greater than the favorite cube's value.
     - "YES" if the `k`-th cube's value is less than the favorite cube's value.
     - "YES" if `k` is the last index or the value of the next cube (`a[k + 1]`) is less than the favorite cube's value, otherwise "MAYBE".

### Correctness Analysis:
- **"NO"**: If `a[k] > x`, it means the favorite cube is definitely not among the first `k` cubes after sorting, so it will not be removed.
- **"YES"**: If `a[k] < x`, it means the favorite cube's value is greater than the value of the `k`-th cube, so it will definitely be among the first `k` cubes and will be removed.
- **"MAYBE"**: If `a[k] == x`, it means the favorite cube's value is the same as the value of the `k`-th cube. In this case:
  - If `k` is the last index, the favorite cube will not be removed.
  - If the value of the next cube (`a[k + 1]`) is less than `x`, it means there are cubes with smaller values after the `k`-th cube, so the favorite cube might be removed.
  - Otherwise, the favorite cube might or might not be removed, depending on the exact arrangement of cubes with the same value.

The program correctly handles all these cases and provides the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
