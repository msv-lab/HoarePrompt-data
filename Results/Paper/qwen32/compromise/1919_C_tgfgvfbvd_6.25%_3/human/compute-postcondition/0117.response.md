The code assigns the value of the element at index `x` in the list `l` to the variable `a`. Given that `x` is defined as `y + 2`, the value of `a` will be the element at index `y + 2` in the list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is less than `n-1`, `x` is `y + 2`, `a` is `l[y + 2]`.**
