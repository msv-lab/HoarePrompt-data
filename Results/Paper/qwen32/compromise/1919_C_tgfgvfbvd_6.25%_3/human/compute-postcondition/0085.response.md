The code snippet assigns the value of `l[y]` to `b`. Given the initial state, `y` is 1, so `b` will now hold the value of `l[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is `l[0]`, `b` is `l[1]`, `c` is `0`, and `y` is 1.**
