Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is `l[0]`, `b` is `l[0]`, `c` is `0`, `y` is `0`. The current value of `l[y]` is greater than `l[y - 1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `y` remain unchanged. The condition that the current value of `l[y]` is greater than `l[y - 1]` still holds true. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
