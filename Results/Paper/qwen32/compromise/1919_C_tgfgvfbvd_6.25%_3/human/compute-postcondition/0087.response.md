Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is `l[0]`, `c` is `0`, and `y` is `1`. If `l[y] > l[y - 1]`, then `b` is `l[1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `b` remains `0`.**
