Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `y` is 0, and `c` is 1 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`; otherwise, `c` is 0. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a` (previously) is greater than or equal to `l[x] - b`, otherwise `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b` and `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`. `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] < b` and either `a - l[x] > b - l[x]` or `l[x] >= a`; otherwise, `b` remains the first element `l[y]` where `l[y] > l[y-1]` or 0 if no such element exists.**
