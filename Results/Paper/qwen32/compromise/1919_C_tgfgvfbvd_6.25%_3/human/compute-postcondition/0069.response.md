Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is 0, `x` is 2. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, then `a` is set to `l[2]`; otherwise, `b` is set to `l[2]`. If `l[1] > a` and `l[1] > b`, then `c` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `a` is set to `l[1]` if `a - l[1] <= b - l[1]` or if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[1]`; otherwise, `b` is set to `l[1]`.**
