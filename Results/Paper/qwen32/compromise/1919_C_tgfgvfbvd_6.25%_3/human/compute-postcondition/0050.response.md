The code assigns the value of the element at index `x` in the list `l` to the variable `b`. Given that `x` is initialized to 1, `b` will be assigned the value of the second element in the list `l` (since indexing starts at 0).

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `y` is 0, `x` is 1, `b` is `l[1]`**.
