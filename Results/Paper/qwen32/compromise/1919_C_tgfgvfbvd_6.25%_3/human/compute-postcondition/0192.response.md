Output State: **`a` is either `l[0]` or `l[x]`, `b` is either the first element in `l` that is greater than its predecessor, `l[x]` if `l[x]` is greater than the previous `b`, or 0 if no such element exists, `c` is 2 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`; otherwise, `c` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `l` is the list of integers read from input, `y` is an index such that `y < n - 1`, and `x` is `x + 1`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `c` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
