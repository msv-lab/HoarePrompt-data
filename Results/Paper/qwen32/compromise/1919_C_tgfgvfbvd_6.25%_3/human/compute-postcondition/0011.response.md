Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `b` is 0, `c` is 0, `y` is 0. If the current value of `l[y]` is greater than `l[y - 1]`, then `b` is set to the first element of the list `l` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `b`.**
