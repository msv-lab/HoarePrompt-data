The code snippet `make_stairs(i - 1)` calls a function `make_stairs` with the argument `i - 1`. This function call does not directly modify the variables `i`, `start_index`, or `is_already_stairs` in the given code snippet. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged. The function `make_stairs` is presumably modifying the array `arr` or performing some operations, but since the function's implementation is not provided, we cannot determine the specific changes to `arr`.

Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer, `is_already_stairs` is `False`, and `arr[start_index + i]` equals `i`.**
