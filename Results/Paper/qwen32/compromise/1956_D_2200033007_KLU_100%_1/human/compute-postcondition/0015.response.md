The code appends a tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` to the list `res`. The values of `i`, `start_index`, and `is_already_stairs` remain unchanged, and `make_stairs(i - 1)` has already been called. The only change is that `res` now includes the new tuple.

Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer, `is_already_stairs` is `False`, and `res` includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`.**
