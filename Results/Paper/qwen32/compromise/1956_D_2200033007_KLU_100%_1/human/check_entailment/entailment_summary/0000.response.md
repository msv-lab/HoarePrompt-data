### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to ensure that both `func_1` and `func_2` together satisfy the problem description and produce the required output.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: To compute the maximum possible sum of the array by considering various subranges and the MEX operation.
- **Implementation**: The function uses memoization (`res_dict`) to store results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations. It recursively calculates the maximum sum by considering different partitions of the array and the value of the MEX operation.
- **Output**: It returns the maximum sum possible for the given range `[start_index, end_index]`.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: To generate the sequence of operations that achieves the maximum sum computed by `func_1`.
- **Implementation**: It recursively determines the operations needed to transform the array into the configuration that yields the maximum sum. It handles different cases based on the maximum sum computed by `func_1`.
- **Output**: It returns a list of tuples, each representing an operation `(l, r)`.

#### Function `make_stairs`:
- **Purpose**: To modify the array into a "staircase" configuration where each segment `[start_index, start_index + i]` is set to values from `0` to `i`.
- **Implementation**: It checks if the segment is already in the desired configuration. If not, it recursively modifies the array and appends the necessary operations to `res`.
- **Output**: It modifies the array and appends operations to `res`.

### Analysis:
- **Memoization**: `func_1` uses memoization to store results of subproblems, which is efficient given the constraints.
- **Recursive Calculation**: Both `func_1` and `func_2` use recursion to explore different configurations of the array, which aligns with the problem's requirement to maximize the sum.
- **Operation Sequence**: `func_2` generates the sequence of operations, which is necessary for the output format.
- **Staircase Configuration**: `make_stairs` ensures that the array is transformed into the optimal configuration, which is a key part of achieving the maximum sum.

### Conclusion:
The program consists of functions that work together to compute the maximum sum and generate the required operations. Given the problem constraints and the implementation details, the program appears to meet the requirements and produce the correct output.

**Correctness: True**
