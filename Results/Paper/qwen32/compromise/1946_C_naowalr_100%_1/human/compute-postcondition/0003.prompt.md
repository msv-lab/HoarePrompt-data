You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` does not take any parameters. It reads input from standard input, which includes multiple sets of input data. Each set starts with two integers `n` and `k` where `1 <= k < n <= 10^5`, representing the number of vertices and the number of edges to be removed, respectively. This is followed by `n-1` lines, each containing two integers `v` and `u` (1 <= v, u <= n) representing an edge between vertices `v` and `u`. The function processes each set of input data to determine the maximum number `x` such that removing exactly `k` edges results in all remaining connected components having at least `x` vertices.
def func_1():
    for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):
        solve()
        
    #State: The function `func_1` has processed all sets of input data provided through standard input. For each set, it has determined the maximum number `x` such that removing exactly `k` edges results in all remaining connected components having at least `x` vertices. The state of variables not involved in the loop (such as those used within the `solve()` function) remains unchanged from their state after processing the last input set.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not take any parameters. It reads multiple sets of input data from standard input, where each set consists of two integers `n` and `k` representing the number of vertices and the number of edges to be removed, respectively, followed by `n-1` lines of edges between vertices. The function processes each set to determine the maximum number `x` such that removing exactly `k` edges results in all remaining connected components having at least `x` vertices.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
