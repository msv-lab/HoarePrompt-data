You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
One of the days of the hike coincided with a holiday, so in the evening at the
camp, it was decided to arrange a festive fireworks display. For this purpose,
the organizers of the hike bought two installations for launching fireworks
and a huge number of shells for launching.

Both installations are turned on simultaneously. The first installation
launches fireworks every a minutes (i.e., after a, 2 \cdot a, 3 \cdot a, \dots
minutes after launch). The second installation launches fireworks every b
minutes (i.e., after b, 2 \cdot b, 3 \cdot b, \dots minutes after launch).

Each firework is visible in the sky for m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., if a
firework was launched after x minutes after the installations were turned on,
it will be visible every minute from x to x + m , inclusive. If one firework
was launched m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one
minute.

What is the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the
same time?

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow the
descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains integers a , b , m (1 \le
a, b, m \le 10^{18} ) — the frequency of launching for the first installation,
the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky.

Output

For each set of input data, output a single number — the maximum number of
fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

Note

In the first set of input data, the fireworks are visible in the sky for 5
minutes. Since the first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and
the second one every 7 minutes, two fireworks launched from the same
installation will not be visible in the sky at the same time. At the same
time, after 7 minutes from the start of the holiday, one firework from the
first and one from the second camp will be visible. Thus, it is possible to
see no more than 2 fireworks simultaneously.

In the third set of input data, 17 fireworks will be visible after 112
minutes:

  * 9 fireworks launched from the first installation at times [56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112 ]; 
  * 8 fireworks launched from the second installation at times [56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112 ].

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        print(m // a + m // b + 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. For each test case, it calculates the value of the expression `m // a + m // b + 2` and prints the result.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The given program is incorrect. The logic in the program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why:

1. **Understanding the problem**: We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be visible at the same time. Fireworks from the first installation are launched every `a` minutes, and fireworks from the second installation are launched every `b` minutes. Each firework remains visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch.

2. **Key insight**: The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is determined by the overlap of visibility periods of fireworks from both installations. This overlap is influenced by the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, which determines how often the launch times of the two installations coincide.

3. **Counting fireworks**: To find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, we need to consider the intervals `[x, x+m]` for each firework launched by both installations and find the maximum overlap of these intervals. This is not simply the sum of the number of fireworks launched by each installation up to `m` minutes.

4. **Correct approach**: The correct approach involves:
   - Calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, which is `lcm(a, b) = a * b // gcd(a, b)`.
   - Determining how many fireworks from each installation are launched within one LCM period.
   - Calculating the maximum overlap of visibility periods within one LCM period.

5. **Flaw in the given program**: The given program incorrectly calculates the result as `m // a + m // b + 2`. This formula does not account for the overlap of visibility periods and is not the correct method to determine the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.

Correctness: **False**
