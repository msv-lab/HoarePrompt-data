Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The logic used in the program (`m // a + m // b + 2`) does not account for the simultaneous visibility of fireworks from both installations over a period of time. The problem requires finding the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time, considering the overlap in their visibility periods.

The given program simply adds the number of fireworks launched by each installation up to time `m` and adds 2, which is not the correct approach to determine the maximum simultaneous visibility of fireworks.

To solve the problem correctly, one would need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to find the periodicity of the fireworks launches and then calculate the maximum number of overlapping fireworks within a period.

Correctness: **False**
