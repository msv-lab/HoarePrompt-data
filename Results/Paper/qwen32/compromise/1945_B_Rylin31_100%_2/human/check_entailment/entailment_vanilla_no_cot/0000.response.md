Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect. The logic used in the function `func` to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is flawed. The current implementation simply adds the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period `m` and adds 2, which does not account for the overlap and simultaneous visibility of fireworks from both installations.

To correctly solve the problem, one must consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity at which fireworks from both installations might overlap. The correct approach involves calculating how many fireworks from each installation are visible within a given time frame and then considering the overlaps. The provided solution does not address these aspects accurately.
