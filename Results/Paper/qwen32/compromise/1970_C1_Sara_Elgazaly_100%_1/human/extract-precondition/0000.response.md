Precondition: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, t is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 <= u_i <= n, representing the starting node for each round. Since t=1, there is only one starting node.**
