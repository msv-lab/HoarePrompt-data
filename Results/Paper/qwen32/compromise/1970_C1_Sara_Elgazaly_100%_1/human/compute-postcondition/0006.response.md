Output State: **`lst` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node and its value is a list of nodes that are directly connected to it in the direction away from the key node; `rev` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node and its value is a list of nodes that are directly connected to it in the direction towards the key node; `z` is an input integer; `tmp` is assigned the value of `z`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is: `lst` and `rev` remain unchanged, `z` retains its input value, and a new variable `tmp` is created with the same value as `z`.
