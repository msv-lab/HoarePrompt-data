The provided code snippet initializes a new `defaultdict` named `rev`. This does not affect the existing variables `n`, `t`, the tree edges, the starting node, `x`, `y`, or `lst`. The only change is the introduction of `rev` as a `defaultdict` of lists.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 <= u_i <= n, representing the starting node for each round. Since t=1, there is only one starting node. `x` and `y` are integers read from the input. `lst` is a defaultdict of lists. `rev` is a defaultdict of lists.**
