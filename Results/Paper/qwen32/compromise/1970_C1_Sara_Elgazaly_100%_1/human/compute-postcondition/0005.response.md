`z` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `lst` and `rev` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`lst` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node and its value is a list of nodes that are directly connected to it in the direction away from the key node; `rev` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node and its value is a list of nodes that are directly connected to it in the direction towards the key node; `z` is an input integer.**
