### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` and a string `a` of length `n`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes a list `count` of length 7 (one for each difficulty level 'A' to 'G') with all elements set to 0.
   - It then iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in `count` based on the difficulty level of each problem.

3. **Calculating Needed Problems:**
   - The function initializes `needed_problems` to 0.
   - It then iterates over the `count` list and checks if the count of any difficulty level is less than `m`.
   - If the count of a difficulty level is less than `m`, it adds the difference `(m - count[i])` to `needed_problems`.

4. **Returning the Result:**
   - The function returns `needed_problems`, which represents the minimum number of additional problems needed to ensure that each difficulty level appears at least `m` times.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 10`, `m = 1`, `a = 'BGECDCBDED'`
   - Count of difficulties: `B=3, G=2, E=2, C=1, D=2`
   - Since `m = 1`, all difficulties are already present at least once.
   - Problems needed: `0` (but since 'A' and 'F' are missing, it's `2`).

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 10`, `m = 2`, `a = 'BGECDCBDED'`
   - Count of difficulties: `B=3, G=2, E=2, C=1, D=2`
   - Problems needed: `2` (for 'C') + `1` (for 'A') + `2` (for 'F') = `5`.

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 9`, `m = 1`, `a = 'BBCDEFFGG'`
   - Count of difficulties: `B=2, C=1, D=1, E=1, F=2, G=2`
   - Problems needed: `1` (for 'A').

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct as it accurately calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case based on the given constraints and examples.

**Correctness:** **True**
