Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5; a is a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'; count is a list of 7 integers, all initialized to 0.**

In this output state, the variable `count` has been initialized to a list containing seven zeros. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, and `a`) retain their initial values and conditions.
