Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `a`. `n` is the length of the string `a`, and `m` is the minimum number of times each character type ('A' to 'G') should appear in the string `a`. The function returns the total number of additional problems needed to ensure each character type appears at least `m` times in the string `a`.**
