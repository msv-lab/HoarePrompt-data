Let's systematically evaluate the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, program code, and function summary.

### Problem Analysis:

Nikita can perform two types of moves:
1. Add exactly 1 cube to the tower.
2. Remove exactly 1 cube from the tower.

The goal is to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, starting from 0 cubes.

### Key Observations:

1. **Parity of Moves and Result:**
   - If `n` (number of moves) is even, then the final number of cubes `m` must also be even. This is because each pair of moves (add and remove) results in no net change in the number of cubes, or two adds result in an even increase, or two removes result in an even decrease.
   - If `n` is odd, then the final number of cubes `m` must also be odd. This is because an odd number of moves will result in either an odd increase (if more adds than removes) or an odd decrease (if more removes than adds).

2. **Range of Possible Values:**
   - The minimum number of cubes after `n` moves is `0` (if all moves are removes and we start from 0).
   - The maximum number of cubes after `n` moves is `n` (if all moves are adds).

### Code Analysis:

Let's break down the code to see if it aligns with the above observations:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

- The code correctly handles the case where `n == m` (direct match).
- It correctly handles the case where `m > n` (impossible to have more cubes than moves).
- It correctly handles the case where `m == n - 1` (possible if the last move is a remove after `n` adds).
- The code then checks the parity of `m` and `n`:
  - If both are even, it prints 'Yes'.
  - If both are odd, it prints 'Yes'.
  - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Issues in the Code:

- **Missing Parity Check for `m < n - 1`:** The code doesn't handle cases where `m < n - 1` and the parity matches. For example, if `n = 5` and `m = 1`, the code will incorrectly print 'No' because it doesn't consider the possibility of reaching `m` through a combination of adds and removes that results in the correct parity.

### Example Analysis:

Let's consider the test cases provided in the problem description:

1. **Test Case 1: `n = 3`, `m = 3`**
   - The code correctly prints 'Yes' because `n == m`.

2. **Test Case 2: `n = 2`, `m = 4`**
   - The code correctly prints 'No' because `m > n`.

3. **Test Case 3: `n = 5`, `m = 3`**
   - The code correctly prints 'Yes' because `m == n - 2` and both `m` and `n` are odd.

However, let's consider an additional test case:

4. **Test Case 4: `n = 5`, `m = 1`**
   - The code incorrectly prints 'No' because it doesn't handle the case where `m < n - 1` and the parity matches.

### Conclusion:

The code fails to correctly handle all possible cases, specifically cases where `m < n - 1` and the parity of `m` and `n` matches. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
