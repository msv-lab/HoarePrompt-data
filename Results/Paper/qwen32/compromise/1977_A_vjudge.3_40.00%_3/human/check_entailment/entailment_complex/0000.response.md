Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to determine if it is possible for Nikita to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The logic in the program is flawed. Here's why:

1. The program checks if `n == m` and prints "Yes" if true. This is correct because if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, Nikita can just add one cube in each move.

2. The program then checks if `m > n` and prints "No" if true. This is also correct because Nikita cannot have more cubes than the number of moves he has made.

3. The program checks if `m == n - 1` and prints "Yes" if true. This is correct because if the number of cubes is one less than the number of moves, Nikita can add one cube in `m` moves and remove one cube in the last move.

4. The remaining conditions (`m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0` and `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`) are incorrect. The parity (evenness or oddness) of `m` and `n` does not determine whether it is possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves. The key point is that the difference between `n` and `m` should be even because each pair of one addition and one removal operation (or vice versa) changes the number of cubes by 0 or 2. So, if `n - m` is even, it is possible to reach `m` cubes with `n` moves.

The correct logic should be:
- If `n == m`, print "Yes".
- If `m > n`, print "No".
- If `m == n - 1`, print "Yes".
- If `(n - m) % 2 == 0`, print "Yes".
- Otherwise, print "No".

Thus, the given program is incorrect because it does not properly check the parity of the difference between `n` and `m`.

Correctness: **False**
