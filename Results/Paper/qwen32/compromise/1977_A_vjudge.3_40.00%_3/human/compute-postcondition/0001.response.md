The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts, as it is initialized by the `range` function.

Given that `t` is already defined as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, the loop will definitely execute because `t` meets the condition of being greater than 0.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100**
