You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Annotated Code: 
from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `N` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer; `cnt` is a defaultdict of type int where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that integer in the list `a`.
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
        
    #State: the first integer `i` in the range `[0, N]` such that either `t` becomes `2` or `cnt[i]` is `0`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `N` and a list `a` of `N` integers. It then determines and returns the first integer `i` in the range `[0, N]` such that either at least two integers in `a` appear exactly once, or `i` does not appear in `a`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze its logic step by step and compare it with the problem requirements and the optimal strategy for both players.

### Problem Analysis:
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a` and appending them to `c` (Alice) or simply removing them (Bob).
- Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c` at the end of the game.
- Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Key Observations:
- The game's score is the MEX of the array `c` after all elements are removed from `a`.
- Alice and Bob play optimally, meaning they make moves to achieve their respective goals.

### Strategy:
- Alice should aim to include as many distinct elements into `c` as possible, especially the smaller ones, to maximize the MEX.
- Bob should aim to prevent Alice from including small distinct elements into `c` to minimize the MEX.

### Program Analysis:
Let's walk through the program to see if it correctly implements the optimal strategy.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - It uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.

3. **Determining MEX:**
   - It initializes a variable `t` to 0, which seems to count the number of elements that appear exactly once in `a`.
   - It iterates over the range from 0 to `N` (inclusive) and checks:
     - If an element `i` appears exactly once in `a` (`cnt[i] == 1`), it increments `t`.
     - If `t` is at least 2 or if an element `i` does not appear in `a` (`cnt[i] == 0`), it returns `i` as the MEX.

### Correctness of the Program:
The logic in the program seems to correctly determine the MEX of the array `c` if both players play optimally. Here's why:

- **Optimal Strategy:**
  - Alice will try to pick elements such that the MEX is maximized. If there are multiple elements that appear exactly once, Alice can pick them to maximize the MEX.
  - Bob will try to prevent Alice from picking elements that would maximize the MEX. However, the program correctly identifies the smallest element that either does not appear or appears exactly once, which aligns with the optimal strategy for both players.

- **MEX Calculation:**
  - The program correctly calculates the MEX by iterating over the possible values and checking their occurrences.
  - The condition `if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0` ensures that the smallest possible MEX is returned, considering both the presence and count of elements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
