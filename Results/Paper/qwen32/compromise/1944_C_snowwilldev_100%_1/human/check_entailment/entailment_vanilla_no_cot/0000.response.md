Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the final score of the game when both players play optimally. The logic in the function `func_1` is flawed as it does not account for the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.

Here's a brief explanation of the issues:
- The function `func_1` simply counts the occurrences of each number in the array and checks for the first number that either appears exactly once or does not appear at all, but this does not simulate the game where Alice and Bob are making strategic choices.
- Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she would try to add numbers in such a way that the MEX is as high as possible.
- Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he would try to add numbers in such a way that the MEX is as low as possible.
- The optimal strategy involves considering the parity (odd/even) of the counts of each number and the turn sequence, but the current implementation does not handle this.

A correct approach would involve a more strategic simulation of the game, considering how Alice and Bob would play optimally based on the counts of each number and the current state of the game.
