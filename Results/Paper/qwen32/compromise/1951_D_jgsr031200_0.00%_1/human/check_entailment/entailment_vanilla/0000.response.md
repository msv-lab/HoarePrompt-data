Let's analyze the provided Python code step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap
Bob wants to set up at most 60 stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. Alice buys greedily, starting from the first stall and moving to the next until she can no longer afford any more jewels.

### Code Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of coins Alice has) and `k` (the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case with `n` and `k` as arguments.
   - **Base Case**: If `n == k`, it prints `YES`, sets up one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel, and exits.
   - **Insufficient Coins**: If `n < k`, it prints `NO` because Alice cannot afford `k` jewels.
   - **Costs Calculation**:
     - It initializes a list `costs` with two values: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
     - It then calculates how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall and adjusts `n` accordingly.
     - It checks if the total number of jewels bought (`h`) is less than `k`. If so, it prints `NO`.
     - If `h >= k`, it prints `YES`, the number of stalls (which is always 2 in this case), and the prices.

### Issues in the Code

1. **Stalls Limitation**:
   - The code only tries to set up two stalls, which is not sufficient to handle all cases. For example, in the third test case of the example, 8 stalls are required.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Calculating Jewels Bought**:
   - The logic for calculating the number of jewels bought from each stall and adjusting `n` is incorrect. The code does not correctly simulate Alice's greedy buying behavior across multiple stalls.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The output format is incorrect when printing `YES`. It should print the number of stalls and then the prices, but it currently prints `2` before `YES`.

### Correct Approach

To solve this problem correctly:
- We need to use a greedy approach to simulate Alice's buying behavior.
- We can start by setting up stalls with decreasing prices (e.g., powers of 2) to maximize the number of stalls and ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
- We need to ensure that the total number of stalls does not exceed 60.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the provided code is incorrect. The logic for setting up stalls and calculating the number of jewels bought is flawed, and it does not handle the problem constraints properly.

**Correctness: False**
