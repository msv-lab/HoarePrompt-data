Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^{18}. Depending on the values of `n` and `k`, the function prints specific messages and values. If `n` equals `k`, it prints 'YES', followed by two '1's. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, it performs a series of calculations and prints 'NO' if the sum of the quotients is less than `k`, or 'YES' followed by the elements of a list `costs` if the sum is greater than or equal to `k`. The function does not return any value.**
