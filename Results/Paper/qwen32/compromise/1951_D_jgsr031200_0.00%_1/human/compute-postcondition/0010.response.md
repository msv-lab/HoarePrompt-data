The code snippet assigns a list to the variable `costs` where the first element is `n - k + 1` and the second element is `1`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are only used to compute the value of `costs`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^{18}, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`.**
