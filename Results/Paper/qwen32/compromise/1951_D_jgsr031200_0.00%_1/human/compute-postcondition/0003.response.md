Let's analyze the given task step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers.
- Both `n` and `k` are within the range 1 to \(10^{18}\).
- The current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(1)` statement is independent of the values of `n` and `k`. It simply prints the integer `1` regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.

### Output:
Since the `print` statement is not influenced by the variables `n` and `k`, the output will be the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
