Reasoning:  
The provided program has a logical error in the final `else` block. The intention is to calculate the minimum cost for buying an odd number of yogurts. However, the current code incorrectly prints `X` (which is the integer division of `A` by 2) before calculating the final cost. This print statement is unnecessary and should be removed.

The logic for calculating the cost when `A` is odd is correct: it should buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price `C` and then buy the remaining single yogurt at the regular price `B`.

Here's the corrected `else` block:
```python
else:
    X = A // 2
    print(X * C + B)
```

Without this correction, the output will include unnecessary intermediate results, which do not match the expected format.

Correctness: **False**
