Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has a logical error that causes it to not produce the correct output for certain cases. Let's analyze the code and identify the issue:

The code reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the values of `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts under promotion). The logic in the code is as follows:

1. If the price of two yogurts (`b`) is greater than twice the price of one yogurt (`2*a`), then the code simply multiplies the number of yogurts (`A`) by the price of one yogurt (`B`) and prints the result.
2. If the number of yogurts (`A`) is even, it calculates the cost by multiplying the number of pairs of yogurts (`A // 2`) by the promotion price (`C`) and prints the result.
3. If the number of yogurts (`A`) is odd, it calculates the cost for the pairs and then adds the cost of one more yogurt at the regular price. However, there is an issue in this part of the code.

In the case where the number of yogurts is odd, the code incorrectly prints the value of `X` (which is `A // 2`) before calculating the final cost. Additionally, the code does not correctly calculate the final cost in this case. It should be calculated as `X * C + B` and then printed, but the current code has a print statement before the calculation, which results in incorrect output.

Let's consider a test case to illustrate this issue:

**Test case:**
```
1
3 5 11
```
**Expected output:**
```
15
```
**Actual output:**
```
1
16
```
Here, the code incorrectly prints `1` (which is `X` or `A // 2`), and then `16` (which is `X * C + B`), instead of just `15`.

To fix the code, the print statement before the final calculation should be removed. Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)

```

With this correction, the code should work as expected for all cases. However, the original code provided has the issue mentioned above, so it is considered incorrect.
