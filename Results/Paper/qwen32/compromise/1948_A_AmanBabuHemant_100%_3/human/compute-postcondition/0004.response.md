Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads an integer `n`. It then prints 'YES' followed by a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times if `n` is even and less than or equal to 100 characters long; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**
