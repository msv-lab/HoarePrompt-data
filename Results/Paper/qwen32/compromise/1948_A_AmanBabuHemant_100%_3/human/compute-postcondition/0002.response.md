To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's analyze the code step by step.

The given code consists of a loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the code reads an integer `n` and checks if `n` is odd or even. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` by repeating 'AAB' `n // 2` times. It then checks if the length of `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Given the constraints (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50), the maximum length of the string `s` is `3 * (50 // 2) = 75`, which is well below the 200 character limit. Therefore, for every even `n`, the code will print 'YES' followed by the constructed string `s`. For every odd `n`, the code will print 'NO'.

The output state, therefore, will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' outputs based on whether each `n` is even or odd, and for even `n`, the corresponding constructed string `s`.

Since the exact values of `n` for each test case are not specified, we cannot provide a specific string `s` for each case. However, we can describe the output state in a general format.

Output State: **A series of 'YES' or 'NO' outputs, with 'YES' followed by a constructed string 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times for each even `n`, and 'NO' for each odd `n`.**
