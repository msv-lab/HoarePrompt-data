In the given task, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is an input integer. The loop head only contains the variable `_` and the range `t`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` itself to ensure the loop can execute.

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute `t` times.
- The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted.
- The loop will execute if and only if `t` is greater than 0.

### Adjustment:
- Ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

### State:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
