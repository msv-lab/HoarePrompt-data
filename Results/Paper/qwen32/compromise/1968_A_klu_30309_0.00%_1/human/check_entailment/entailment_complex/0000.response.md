### Reasoning:

The program's goal is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) that maximizes the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). The provided function `func_1(x)` attempts to achieve this by iterating from \( x-1 \) down to 2 and checking if \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \). If \( y \) is a divisor and \( 2y \geq x \), it immediately returns \( y \). If no such \( y \) is found, it returns the largest divisor of \( x \) that is less than or equal to \( x/2 \), or 1 if no such divisor exists.

Let's analyze the correctness of the function:

1. **Immediate Return Condition**:
   - The condition `if x % y == 0 and 2 * y >= x` ensures that if \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \) and \( 2y \geq x \), then \( \gcd(x, y) = y \). This makes \( \gcd(x, y) + y = 2y \), which is maximized when \( y \) is as large as possible under the constraint \( 2y \geq x \). This is a valid strategy because it directly maximizes the sum \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

2. **Fallback Condition**:
   - If no \( y \) satisfies \( 2y \geq x \), the function returns the largest divisor of \( x \) that is less than or equal to \( x/2 \). This ensures that even if no \( y \) can make \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) equal to \( 2y \), the function still returns a valid \( y \) that maximizes the sum given the constraints.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where \( x = 2 \) correctly by returning \( y = 1 \), as \( \gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 2 \), which is the maximum possible value.

Given the above analysis, the function seems to correctly identify a \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for any valid \( x \) within the given constraints.
