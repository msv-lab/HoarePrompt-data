You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided program step by step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) that maximizes the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

### Program Analysis:
The program defines a function `func_1(x)` that is supposed to find such a \( y \). Here's a detailed breakdown of how the function works:

1. **Initialization**: `max_val` is initialized to 1. This variable will store the best \( y \) found so far that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

2. **Loop through possible \( y \) values**:
   - The loop iterates from \( x-1 \) down to 2.
   - For each \( y \), it checks if \( x \% y == 0 \). This condition ensures that \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \).

3. **Check the condition \( 2 * y \geq x \)**:
   - If \( 2 * y \geq x \), the function immediately returns \( y \). This is because if \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \), then \( \gcd(x, y) = y \), and the expression becomes \( y + y = 2 * y \). If \( 2 * y \geq x \), this will be the maximum possible value for \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) because \( y \) is as large as possible while still being a divisor of \( x \).

4. **Update `max_val`**:
   - If \( 2 * y < x \), the function updates `max_val` to \( y \) and continues the loop. This step is not strictly necessary for correctness, as the function will return the first \( y \) it finds that satisfies \( 2 * y \geq x \).

5. **Return `max_val`**:
   - If no \( y \) is found such that \( 2 * y \geq x \), the function returns `max_val`, which is the largest divisor of \( x \) found in the loop.

### Correctness Check:
The function correctly implements the logic to find \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). Here’s why:

- **Divisor Check**: The function only considers \( y \) that are divisors of \( x \), which is necessary because the greatest common divisor of \( x \) and \( y \) is maximized when \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \).
- **Maximization**: The condition \( 2 * y \geq x \) ensures that the function finds the largest possible \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). This is because if \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \), then \( \gcd(x, y) = y \), and the expression becomes \( 2 * y \). If \( 2 * y \) is maximized, the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is also maximized.
- **Edge Cases**: The function handles cases where \( x \) is a prime number or has no divisors larger than \( x/2 \) by returning the largest divisor found.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly finds the \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for any valid input \( x \).

Correctness: **True**
