Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not always find the integer \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). Let's analyze the code and provide a counterexample.

The function `func_1(x)` iterates from \( x-1 \) down to 2, checking if \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) (i.e., \( x \% y == 0 \)). If it is, it checks if \( 2 * y \geq x \). If this condition is met, it immediately returns \( y \). Otherwise, it updates `max_val` to \( y \) and continues. Finally, it returns `max_val` if no earlier return occurred.

This approach does not guarantee that the returned \( y \) maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) because it only considers divisors of \( x \) and does not explore non-divisors that might yield a higher sum.

Let's consider a counterexample:

For \( x = 12 \):
- The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6.
- The function will check these divisors in descending order.
- When it reaches \( y = 6 \), it will find that \( x \% y == 0 \) and \( 2 * 6 \geq 12 \), so it will return \( y = 6 \).
- The value of \( \gcd(12, 6) + 6 = 6 + 6 = 12 \).

However, there is a better choice:
- For \( y = 8 \), \( \gcd(12, 8) = 4 \) and \( \gcd(12, 8) + 8 = 4 + 8 = 12 \).
- For \( y = 10 \), \( \gcd(12, 10) = 2 \) and \( \gcd(12, 10) + 10 = 2 + 10 = 12 \).
- For \( y = 11 \), \( \gcd(12, 11) = 1 \) and \( \gcd(12, 11) + 11 = 1 + 11 = 12 \).

In this case, \( y = 6 \) is not optimal because \( y = 8, 10, 11 \) all yield the same maximum sum of 12. However, the function does not explore non-divisors and might miss better solutions in other cases.

Thus, the code is not always correct, and the Correctness is **False**.
