### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its functions to determine if they correctly solve the problem as described.

#### Problem Recap:
- We have an array `a` of `n` integers.
- We can perform an operation on index `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ n - 1`), which modifies the array as follows:
  - `a[i-1] = a[i-1] - 1`
  - `a[i] = a[i] - 2`
  - `a[i+1] = a[i+1] - 1`
- The goal is to determine if we can make all elements of the array equal to zero using this operation any number of times.

#### Functions Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if it finds any non-zero element. Otherwise, it returns `True`.
   - This function is correctly used to check if the array has been reduced to all zeros after performing the operations.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is supposed to determine if the array can be reduced to all zeros using the specified operation.
   - It iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n - 2` (inclusive), attempting to apply the operation on each valid index.
   - Inside the loop, there is a `while` loop that continues as long as `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0.
   - Inside the `while` loop, the array is modified in a way that seems incorrect:
     - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
   - The intention seems to be to reduce `list[i]` by 2 and `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` by 1, but the current implementation incorrectly multiplies these reductions by `list[i - 1]`, which doesn't align with the problem's operation.
   - After the loop, if `list[i - 1]` is not zero, it immediately prints "no" and returns, which is incorrect because it should check the entire array before concluding.
   - Finally, it calls `func_1` to check if the entire array is zero and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

#### Issues Found:
- The logic inside the `while` loop in `func_2` is incorrect. It should be reducing the elements by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, not by multiples of `list[i - 1]`.
- The function incorrectly prints "no" as soon as `list[i - 1]` is not zero, which is not the correct approach to determine if the entire array can be zeroed out.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in `func_2`, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
