Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program contains several issues that make it incorrect for solving the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Operation Logic**:
   - The operation described in the problem involves subtracting 1 from `a[i-1]`, 2 from `a[i]`, and 1 from `a[i+1]`. However, in `func_2`, the program incorrectly multiplies these subtractions by `list[i - 1]`, which is not part of the operation logic described in the problem.

2. **Incorrect Loop Conditions**:
   - The loop in `func_2` runs while `list[i] > 1`, but this condition is too restrictive. The operation can be applied as long as `list[i] >= 2` and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0.

3. **Incorrect Termination Logic**:
   - The program prints "no" immediately if `list[i-1]` is not zero after the inner loop, which is incorrect. The operation can still be applied to other indices, and the array might still be reducible to zeros.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - The function `func_2` prints "YES" or "NO" directly, which is not suitable for the problem's requirement to handle multiple test cases and return the results in a specific format.

5. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if all elements in the list are zero, which is correct, but it should be used more appropriately within the logic of `func_2`.

To fix the program, the operation logic should be correctly implemented, and the program should handle multiple test cases properly. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_make_zero(a, n):
    if n < 3:
        return "NO"
    
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while a[i] >= 2 and a[i - 1] > 0 and a[i + 1] > 0:
            a[i - 1] -= 1
            a[i] -= 2
            a[i + 1] -= 1
    
    return "YES" if all(x == 0 for x in a) else "NO"

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, input[index:index+n]))
        index += n
        results.append(can_make_zero(a, n))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version reads the input correctly, applies the operation as described, and checks if all elements can be made zero. It handles multiple test cases and outputs the results in the required format.
