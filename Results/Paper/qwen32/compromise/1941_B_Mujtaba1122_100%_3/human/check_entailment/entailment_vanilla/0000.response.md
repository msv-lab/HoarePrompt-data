Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to determine whether we can make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation:
- Choose an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)).
- Perform the operation: 
  - \( a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1 \)
  - \( a_i = a_i - 2 \)
  - \( a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1 \)

### Program Analysis
Let's break down the provided Python code:

#### Function `func_1`
```python
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True
```
- This function checks if all elements in the list are zero. If any element is non-zero, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.

#### Function `func_2`
```python
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```
- This function iterates through the array from index 1 to \( n-2 \) (inclusive).
- For each index \( i \), it checks if \( a_i > 1 \) and both \( a_{i-1} \) and \( a_{i+1} \) are greater than 0.
- If the condition is met, it performs the operation multiple times (specifically, it attempts to subtract \( a_{i-1} \) from \( a_{i+1} \), \( 2 \times a_{i-1} \) from \( a_i \), and \( a_{i-1} \) from \( a_{i-1} \)).
- However, there is a critical flaw in this logic:
  - The operation should reduce \( a_{i-1} \) by 1, \( a_i \) by 2, and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1. The current code incorrectly multiplies the decrements by \( a_{i-1} \), which is not the intended operation.
- After the loop, it checks if the first element \( a_0 \) is zero. If not, it prints "no" and exits.
- Finally, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

### Conclusion
The provided code does not correctly implement the described operation. The logic for modifying the array elements is flawed, and it does not guarantee that the array can be reduced to all zeros if possible.

Thus, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
