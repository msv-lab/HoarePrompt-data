Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads `t` (number of test cases).
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the array) and the array itself.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if the first `n` elements of the list are all zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if it finds any non-zero element.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to make all elements of the array zero using the described operation.
   - It iterates through the array from index 1 to `n-2` (inclusive).
   - For each index `i`, it repeatedly applies the operation as long as `list[i] > 1`, `list[i - 1] > 0`, and `list[i + 1] > 0`.
   - The operation is applied by decrementing `list[i + 1]` by `list[i - 1]`, `list[i]` by `2 * list[i - 1]`, and `list[i - 1]` by `list[i - 1]`.
   - If at any point `list[i - 1]` is not zero after the loop, it prints "NO" and returns.
   - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if the entire list is zero. If it is, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

**Issues in the Program**:
- The operation inside the while loop is incorrect. The operation should decrement `list[i + 1]` by 1, `list[i]` by 2, and `list[i - 1]` by 1, not by `list[i - 1]`.
- The condition `list[i] > 1` is not sufficient to ensure that the operation can be applied. The operation can be applied as long as `list[i] >= 2`, `list[i - 1] >= 1`, and `list[i + 1] >= 1`.
- The function does not handle the case where the array cannot be made zero due to the initial configuration of the array elements.

**Correctness**:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
