### Reasoning:

Let's revisit the problem and the provided code to understand why the original assessment is accurate and the program is indeed incorrect.

#### Problem Recap:
Rudolf wants to make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation:
- Choose an index \(i\) where \(2 \leq i \leq n-1\).
- Perform the operation: 
  - \(a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1\)
  - \(a_i = a_i - 2\)
  - \(a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1\)

The operation can be applied any number of times.

#### Provided Code Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(list, n)`**:
   - This function correctly checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero; otherwise, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2(list, n)`**:
   - This function attempts to perform the operations to make all elements zero.
   - **Issues**:
     - **Incorrect operation logic**: The while loop condition and operations inside the loop are incorrect. The current implementation multiplies the values by `list[i - 1]`, which is not how the operation should be applied. The correct operation should subtract 1 from \(a_{i-1}\), 2 from \(a_i\), and 1 from \(a_{i+1}\) in each iteration.
     - **Early termination**: The function prints 'no' and returns immediately if `list[i - 1]` is not zero after the loop for a particular \(i\). This is incorrect because the operation can be applied to other indices as well.
     - **Output handling**: The function prints 'YES' or 'NO' directly, which is not suitable for handling multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.

#### Example Analysis:
Let's consider the first example from the problem description:
- Input: `5 1 3 5 5 2`
- Expected Output: `YES`

The provided code will incorrectly handle this example due to the incorrect operation logic and early termination. Specifically, the operation will not be applied correctly, and the function will likely terminate prematurely.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identifies the issues in the provided code. The logic for applying the operation is flawed, and the function does not correctly determine if the array can be made zero. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
