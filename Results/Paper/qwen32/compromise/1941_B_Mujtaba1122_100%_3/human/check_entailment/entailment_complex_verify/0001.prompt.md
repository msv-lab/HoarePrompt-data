You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]

- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = input()
    lst = list(map(int, l.split()))
    func_2(lst, n)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(list).
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
        
    #State: The loop has completed all `n` iterations without returning `False`, indicating that all elements in `list` from index 0 to `n-1` are 0. The function will implicitly return `None`.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` checks if the first `n` elements of the input list are all zeros. It returns `False` if any of these elements are not zero, and `True` if all of them are zero.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of non-negative integers, and n is an integer such that n >= 3 and n is equal to the length of list.
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
        
    #State: [0, 0, 0]
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: The list remains `[0, 0, 0]`. If `func_1(list, n)` evaluates to True, the current state of the program includes these conditions being satisfied. Otherwise, the condition checked by `func_1(list, n)` is false.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list of non-negative integers and an integer `n` representing the length of the list, which must be at least 3. It modifies the list in place and prints either 'no', 'YES', or 'NO' based on certain conditions. The function does not return any value (returns `None`).




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to determine whether we can make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation multiple times. The operation involves selecting an index \(i\) (where \(2 \leq i \leq n-1\)) and modifying \(a_{i-1}\), \(a_i\), and \(a_{i+1}\) as follows:
- \(a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1\)
- \(a_i = a_i - 2\)
- \(a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1\)

The operation can be applied any number of times, and any index \(i\) can be used zero or more times.

### Program Analysis
The given program consists of two functions:
1. **func_1(list, n)**: This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
2. **func_2(list, n)**: This function attempts to perform the described operation to make all elements zero.

#### func_1(list, n)
This function is straightforward. It iterates through the list and returns `False` if it finds any non-zero element. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

#### func_2(list, n)
This function is intended to perform the operations described in the problem but contains several issues:
- **Incorrect operation logic**: The while loop condition and the operations inside the loop are incorrect. The operation should reduce \(a_{i-1}\), \(a_i\), and \(a_{i+1}\) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, but the current implementation incorrectly multiplies these values by `list[i - 1]`.
- **Early termination**: The function prints 'no' and returns immediately if `list[i - 1]` is not zero after the loop for a particular \(i\). This is incorrect because the operation can be applied to other indices as well.
- **Output handling**: The function prints 'YES' or 'NO' directly, which is not suitable for handling multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.

### Correctness
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be made zero using the described operations.

### Conclusion
The program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
