### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotations to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:

The task is to determine if it is possible to make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation. The operation allows choosing an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \leq i \leq n-1 \)) and performing the following changes:
- \( a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1 \)
- \( a_i = a_i - 2 \)
- \( a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1 \)

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if the first `n` elements of the list are all zero.
   - The annotations confirm that this function correctly returns `True` if all elements are zero and `False` otherwise.
   - This function is correctly implemented.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is supposed to apply the described operation to make all elements zero if possible.
   - The annotations show that the current implementation of the operation is incorrect. Specifically, the operation is being applied as:
     - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
   - This is not the intended operation, as it incorrectly multiplies the values by the value of the previous element.
   - The annotations also indicate that the function does not correctly ensure that the array can be made zero, as it checks if `list[i - 1] != 0` and prints 'no' if true, which is not the correct logic.

3. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The operation is not being applied correctly, as it should be:
     - `list[i + 1] -= 1`
     - `list[i] -= 2`
     - `list[i - 1] -= 1`
   - The loop and condition checks in `func_2` are not sufficient to ensure that the operation can be applied correctly and that the array can be made zero.

#### Annotations:

- The annotations confirm the issues in the implementation of the operation in `func_2`.
- The annotations do not show that the function correctly determines if the array can be made zero.

#### Conclusion:

The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations. The operation is incorrectly implemented, and the logic does not ensure that the array can be made zero.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
