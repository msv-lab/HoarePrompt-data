Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

### Issues in the Code:

1. **Incorrect Operation Implementation**:
   - The operation described in the problem statement is:
     - `a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1`
     - `a_i = a_i - 2`
     - `a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1`
   - However, in the `func_2` function, the operation is incorrectly implemented as:
     - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
   - This means that the operation is not being applied correctly, as it is multiplying the values by the value of the previous element, which is not what the problem statement describes.

2. **Incorrect Check for Zero Elements**:
   - The `func_1` function checks if all elements in the list are zero, but it is not being used correctly in `func_2`. The `func_2` function should check if the array can be made zero, not just if it is already zero.

3. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The loop in `func_2` only runs for `i` from 1 to `n-2`, which is correct, but the way the operation is applied is incorrect.
   - The condition `while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0)` is not sufficient to ensure that the operation can be applied correctly. It should check if the operation can be applied at least once, and then apply it until no more operations can be made.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the input:
```
3
5
1 3 5 5 2
5
2 4 4 5 1
5
0 1 3 3 1
```

The program will not correctly determine the output for these cases due to the incorrect implementation of the operation.

### Correct Implementation Example:

Here is a corrected version of the program that should work as expected:

```python
def can_make_zero(a):
    n = len(a)
    if n < 3:
        return False
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while a[i] >= 2 and a[i - 1] >= 1 and a[i + 1] >= 1:
            a[i - 1] -= 1
            a[i] -= 2
            a[i + 1] -= 1
    return all(x == 0 for x in a)

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    t = int(input[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        a = list(map(int, input[index + 1: index + 1 + n]))
        index += 1 + n
        if can_make_zero(a):
            results.append("YES")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    print("\n".join(results))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version properly implements the operation and checks if the array can be made zero.
