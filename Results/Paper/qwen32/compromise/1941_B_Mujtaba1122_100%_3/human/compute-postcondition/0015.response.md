The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'no'`. The precondition describes the state of a list and a current index `i` but does not influence the content of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or conditions described in the precondition.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state describes a list with elements `[0, 0, 0]`.
2. The current index `i` is such that `list[i - 1]` is not 0, but this condition does not affect the `print` statement.
3. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'no'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **no**
