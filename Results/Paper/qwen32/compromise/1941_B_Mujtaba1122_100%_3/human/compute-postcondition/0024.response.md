The code modifies the value at index `i + 1` in the list by subtracting `1 * list[i - 1]` from it. Given the initial state, `i` is `1`, so the value at index `2` (`list[2]`) is updated by subtracting `1 * list[0]` from it. Initially, `list[0]` is `1` and `list[2]` is `1`, so `list[2]` becomes `1 - 1 * 1 = 0`.

The values of `list`, `i`, and `n` are the only variables affected by the code. The value of `n` remains greater than `4`, but its specific value is not altered by the code.

Output State: **`list` is `[1, 2, 0]`, `i` is `1`, `n` must be greater than `4`**.
