The code `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` modifies the element at index `i - 1` of the list. Given that `i` is `1`, the element at index `0` of the list will be modified. The operation `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` means the element at index `0` will be reduced by its own value, effectively setting it to `0`.

Given the initial state, `list` is `[1, 0, 0]`. After the operation, `list[0]` will become `0`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list` is `[0, 0, 0]`, `i` is `1`, `n` must be greater than `4`**.
