The code `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` modifies the value at index `i - 1` of the list. Given that `i` is `2`, the index `i - 1` is `1`. The value at index `1` in the list is `1`. The operation `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` is equivalent to `list[1] -= 1 * list[1]`, which means `list[1] = list[1] - list[1]`, resulting in `list[1] = 0`.

The values of `list`, `i`, and `n` are the only variables affected. The list is now `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `i` remains `2`, and `n` is still greater than `4`.

Output State: **`list` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `i` is `2`, `n` is greater than `4`**.
