To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```
while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `list` is `[0, 0, 0]`
- `n` is `3`
- `i` is `1`

The loop condition checks three conditions:
1. `list[i] > 1`
2. `list[i - 1] > 0`
3. `list[i + 1] > 0`

Let's evaluate these conditions with the current state:
1. `list[1] > 1` translates to `0 > 1` which is `False`
2. `list[0] > 0` translates to `0 > 0` which is `False`
3. `list[2] > 0` translates to `0 > 0` which is `False`

Since all conditions are `False`, the loop does not execute. To make the loop execute one more time, we need to adjust the list values such that all conditions are `True`.

Let's adjust the state so that the conditions are met:
- For `list[1] > 1`, we need `list[1]` to be greater than 1. Let's set `list[1]` to `2`.
- For `list[0] > 0`, we need `list[0]` to be greater than 0. Let's set `list[0]` to `1`.
- For `list[2] > 0`, we need `list[2]` to be greater than 0. Let's set `list[2]` to `1`.

Thus, the adjusted list should be `[1, 2, 1]`.

No other states need to be adjusted as the loop condition only involves the list and the index `i`.

State: **`list` is [1, 2, 1], `n` is 3, `i` is 1**
