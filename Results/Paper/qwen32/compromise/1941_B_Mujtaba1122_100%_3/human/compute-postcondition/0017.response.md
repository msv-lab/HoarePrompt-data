To determine the postcondition, we need to consider the precondition and the negation of the if condition. The precondition states that the list is `[0, 0, 0]`. The if condition is `if (list[i - 1] != 0)`, which means that the element at the index `i - 1` in the list is not equal to 0. Since the program does not enter the if block, the condition `list[i - 1] != 0` must be false, which implies `list[i - 1] == 0`.

Given that the list is `[0, 0, 0]`, the element at any index `i - 1` will always be 0, satisfying the negation of the if condition.

Postcondition: **The list is `[0, 0, 0]`, and the element at index `i - 1` is 0.**
