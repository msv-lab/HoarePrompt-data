The code modifies the value at index `i` of the list by subtracting twice the value at index `i - 1` from it. Given the initial state, `list[i]` is `list[1]` which is `2`, and `list[i - 1]` is `list[0]` which is `1`. Therefore, the operation `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` translates to `list[1] -= 2 * list[0]` or `2 -= 2 * 1`, which results in `2 -= 2` or `list[1]` becoming `0`.

The value of `list` is now `[1, 0, 0]`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list` is [1, 0, 0], `n` is 3, `i` is 1**.
