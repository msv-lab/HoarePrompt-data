Reasoning:  
The provided program calculates the squared distances between two pairs of points and prints the smaller of the two. However, this approach does not guarantee that it is correctly identifying the side length of the square. 

In a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be determined by calculating the absolute difference in the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of any two adjacent points. The program should compute the absolute differences between appropriate pairs of points and then square the result to find the area.

The current program calculates the squared Euclidean distance between two pairs of points, which is not necessarily the side length of the square. For example, if the points are (1, 2), (4, 5), (1, 5), and (4, 2), the program calculates the squared distances between (1, 2) and (1, 5) and between (4, 5) and (4, 2), which are both 9, and then prints 9. This is correct for this case, but it is not a general solution.

A better approach would be to find the unique x and y coordinates, determine the side length as the difference between the maximum and minimum x or y coordinates, and then square that value to get the area.

Correctness: **False**
