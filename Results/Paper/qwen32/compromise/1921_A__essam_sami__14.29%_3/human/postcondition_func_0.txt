The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. For each test case, the function calculates the squared distances between two pairs of these points and prints the smaller of the two squared distances.
