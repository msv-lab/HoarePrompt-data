To understand the output state, let's break down the provided code snippet and how it processes the input for each test case.

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The variable `t` represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) are read, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The code calculates two squared distances:
     - `n` is the squared distance between points `(a, b)` and `(e, f)`.
     - `x` is the squared distance between points `(c, g)` and `(d, h)`.
   - It then compares these distances and prints the smaller one.

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the code outputs the smaller of the two squared distances.

Given the loop iterates `t` times, the output state will consist of `t` lines, each containing the result of the comparison for the corresponding test case.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations can be described as:

Output State: **For each of the `t` test cases, the output will be the smaller of the two squared distances calculated between the given pairs of points.**
