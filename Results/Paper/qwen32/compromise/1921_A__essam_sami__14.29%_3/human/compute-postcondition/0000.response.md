Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100. For each of the `t` test cases, there are four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) where -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to the integer value provided by the input, which represents the number of test cases. The conditions and constraints for `t` and the coordinates (x_i, y_i) remain unchanged as they were part of the initial state and are not altered by the provided code snippet.
