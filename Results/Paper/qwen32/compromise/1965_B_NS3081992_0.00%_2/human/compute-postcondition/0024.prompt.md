You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
def func_14():
    n, k = func_7()
    b = bin(n)[2:]
    l = len(b)
    if (k == 1) :
        if (n == 2) :
            return '1\n2'
            #The program returns the string '1\n2'
        #State: `k` equals 1, `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `n` is not equal to 2, `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, and `l` is the length of the binary string `b`.
        ans = [2, 3]
        for i in range(2, l):

        #State: `k` equals 1, `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `n` is not equal to 2, `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary string `b`, `ans` is `[2, 3, 2^2, 2^3, ..., 2^(l-1)]`.
    else :
        bk = bin(k)[2:]
        ans = []
        lk = len(bk)
        for i in range(lk - 1):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: `n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 < k <= n`; `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix; `l` is the length of the binary string `b`; `bk` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix; `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk`; `ans` is a list containing `[2
        ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))
        ans.append(k + 1)
        ans.append(2 * k + 1)
        for i in range(lk, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: `ans` is `[2, k - 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2
    #State: `n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 <= k <= n`; `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix; `l` is the length of the binary string `b`. If `k` equals 1, `ans` is `[2, 3, 2^2, 2^3, ..., 2^(l-1)]`. Otherwise, `ans` is `[2, k - 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2]`.
    return ' '.join(map(str, ans))
    #The program returns a space-separated string of the list `ans`, where `ans` is `[2, 3, 2^2, 2^3, ..., 2^(l-1)]` if `k` equals 1, or `[2, k - 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2]` if `k` does not equal 1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k` such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. It returns the string '1\n2' if `n` and `k` are not specified in the output conditions. If `k` equals 1, it returns a space-separated string of the list `[2, 3, 2^2, 2^3, ..., 2^(l-1)]`. If `k` does not equal 1, it returns a space-separated string of the list `[2, k - 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2]`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the string '1\n2'

Case_2: The program returns a space-separated string of the list `ans`, where `ans` is `[2, 3, 2^2, 2^3, ..., 2^(l-1)]` if `k` equals 1, or `[2, k - 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2]` if `k` does not equal 1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
