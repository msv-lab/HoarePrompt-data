The code snippet `ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))` modifies the list `ans` by appending a new value to it. Initially, `ans` contains a single element, which is `2`. The new value to be appended is calculated as `k - 1 - sum(ans)`. Since `ans` initially contains `[2]`, `sum(ans)` is `2`. Therefore, the new value to be appended is `k - 1 - 2`, which simplifies to `k - 3`.

After the execution of the code, the list `ans` will be `[2, k - 3]`. The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, and `lk` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 < k <= n`; `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix; `l` is the length of the binary string `b`; `bk` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix; `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk`; `ans` is a list containing `[2, k - 3]`.**
