Output State: **`k` equals 1, `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `n` is not equal to 2, `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, and `l` is the length of the binary string `b`; `ans` is `[2, 3]`.**

Natural language: The value of `ans` has been updated to `[2, 3]`. The values of `k`, `n`, `b`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial state.
