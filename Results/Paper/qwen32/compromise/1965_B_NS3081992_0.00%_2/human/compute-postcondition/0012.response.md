The code snippet initializes an empty list `ans`. No other variables are affected or modified by this code. 

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 < k <= n`; `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix; `l` is the length of the binary string `b`; `bk` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix; `ans` is an empty list.**
