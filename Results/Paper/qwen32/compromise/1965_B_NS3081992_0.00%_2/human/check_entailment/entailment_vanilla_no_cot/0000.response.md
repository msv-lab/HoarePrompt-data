To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify whether the function `func_14()` correctly generates a sequence `a` that satisfies the problem's conditions for each test case. Let's analyze the program step by step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function `func_14()` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.
   
2. **Binary Representation:**
   - It converts `n` and `k` to their binary representations.
   
3. **Handling Special Case `k == 1`:**
   - If `k` is 1, the function generates a sequence that excludes 1 but includes all powers of 2 up to the highest power less than or equal to `n`. If `n` is 2, it simply returns `[2]`.
   
4. **General Case `k != 1`:**
   - For `k != 1`, the function generates a sequence that includes:
     - All powers of 2 up to the highest power less than the length of the binary representation of `k`.
     - `k - 1 - sum(ans)`: This is added to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`.
     - `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1`: These are added to ensure that all sums up to `n` can be formed except `k`.
     - All powers of 2 from the length of the binary representation of `k` up to the highest power less than or equal to `n`.

5. **Output:**
   - The function returns the sequence as a space-separated string of integers.

Let's verify if this approach satisfies the problem's conditions:

- **No subsequence sums to `k`:**
  - The inclusion of `k - 1 - sum(ans)` ensures that the exact sum `k` cannot be formed by any combination of the elements in the sequence.
  
- **All sums from 1 to `n` (except `k`) can be formed:**
  - The inclusion of powers of 2 allows the formation of all sums that are powers of 2 or combinations thereof.
  - The additional elements `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` help in forming sums that are not powers of 2, ensuring that all sums from 1 to `n` (except `k`) can be formed.

Based on the above analysis, the function `func_14()` appears to correctly generate the required sequence for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
