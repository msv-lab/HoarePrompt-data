You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 15 : The function `func_15` generates and prints a sequence of values, each on a new line, based on the number of test cases provided by `func_10` and the sequence generation logic provided by `func_14`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_14()` generates a sequence that does not necessarily satisfy the conditions for all possible values of `n` and `k`.

Let's analyze the code and the problem requirements:

1. **Condition 1**: There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
2. **Condition 2**: For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

The code handles binary representations of `n` and `k` and constructs sequences based on these representations. However, there are specific cases where the constructed sequence might not meet the conditions.

### Example Case 1: `n = 8`, `k = 8`
The code generates the sequence `[1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 17]` for `n = 8` and `k = 8`. Here, `7` can be formed by the subsequence `[1, 2, 4]`, but `9` cannot be formed using the numbers in the sequence `[1, 2, 4, 7]` alone, which means the sequence is incorrect.

### Example Case 2: `n = 10`, `k = 7`
The code generates the sequence `[1, 2, 8, 3]` for `n = 10` and `k = 7`. Here, `7` cannot be formed by any subsequence of `[1, 2, 8, 3]`, but `11` can be formed by `[3, 8]`, which is not within the range `[1, 10]`. Also, `6` cannot be formed by any subsequence of `[1, 2, 8, 3]`.

### Example Case 3: `n = 6`, `k = 1`
The code generates the sequence `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` for `n = 6` and `k = 1`. Here, `1` cannot be formed by any subsequence of `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, which satisfies the first condition. However, `1` is not within the range `[1, 6]` except for `k`, so the sequence is correct for this specific case. But we need to ensure it works for all cases.

### Example Case 4: `n = 9`, `k = 3`
The code generates the sequence `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` for `n = 9` and `k = 3`. Here, `3` can be formed by the subsequence `[1, 1, 1]`, which violates the first condition.

From these examples, it is clear that the provided code does not handle all cases correctly. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
