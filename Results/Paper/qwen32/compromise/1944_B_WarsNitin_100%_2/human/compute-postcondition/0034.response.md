Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `k` is 0 if the original `k` was 0, otherwise it is twice its original value minus 2 if `b[n - 2]` equals `b[n - 1]`, or twice its original value otherwise; `a` is a list of integers; `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end; `ans1` is an empty list if `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`, otherwise it contains the last element of `b` twice; `ans2` is an empty list; `req` is 0 if `k` was originally 0, otherwise it is equal to the new value of `k`; `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, the last element of `b` (`b[n - 1]`) if `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`, otherwise `l` is an empty list. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, then `l` includes `b[i]` as its last element. `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]` if the condition `b[i] != b[i + 1]` holds.**
