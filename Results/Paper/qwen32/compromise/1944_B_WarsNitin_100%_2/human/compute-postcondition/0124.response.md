Postcondition: **`t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is either 0 or twice the second integer from the input minus 2, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` contains the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` contains the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end sorted in ascending order, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing the `n-1`th element of `b` twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` equals `k`, `q` is incremented by 1. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
