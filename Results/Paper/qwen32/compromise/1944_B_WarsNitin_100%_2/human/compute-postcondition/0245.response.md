The code snippet `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the element `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. This means that the list `ans1` will now include one additional element, which is `b[i]`.

Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, `q`, and `i` remain unchanged except for `ans1`, which gets updated.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is -2 if it was 0 initially and `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, otherwise `k` remains unchanged if `b[i] == b[i - 1]` or `k` is 0 if it was 0 initially and `b[i] != b[i - 1]`. `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is `a[n:]` sorted in ascending order, `ans1` includes `b[i]` appended to it, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is twice the second integer from the input, `q` is 1, and `i` is `i_current + 2`. If `b[i] != b[i + 1]`, `l` includes `b[i]`. If `k == 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms, `ans1` now contains an additional element `b[i]`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
