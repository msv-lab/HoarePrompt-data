Postcondition: **`t` remains the same, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is either 0 or the value of `req`, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicates of elements from `b` where consecutive elements are equal, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` remains the same, `q` remains the same. If `k` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
