Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` is 0, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` remains the same, `ans2` contains all pairs of consecutive duplicates from `c` up to the point where `k` becomes 0 or the loop completes, `req` equals 0, `l` must have at least one element and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans1`, `req`, and the condition that `l` must have at least one element remain unchanged. The variable `k` is set to 0, and `ans2` contains all pairs of consecutive duplicates from `c` up to the point where `k` became 0 or the loop completed. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
