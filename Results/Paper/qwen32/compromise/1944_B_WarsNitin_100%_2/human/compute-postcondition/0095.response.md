Postcondition: **`t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` is decreased by 1, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` includes `l[i]` as its last element, `ans2` contains all pairs of consecutive duplicates from `c` up to the point where `k` becomes 0 or the loop completes, plus `l[i]` as its last element, `req` equals 0 if `k` was 0, otherwise `req` equals the final value of `k`, `l` must have at least one element, `i` is incremented by 1. If `k` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
