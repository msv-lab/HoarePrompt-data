Postcondition: **`t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` is 0 if the condition `k == 0` is true, otherwise `k` retains its original value, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` remains the same, `ans2` contains all pairs of consecutive duplicates from `c` up to the point where `k` becomes 0 or the loop completes, `req` equals 0 if `k` was 0, otherwise `req` equals the final value of `k`, and `l` must have at least one element.**
