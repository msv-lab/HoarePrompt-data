The code appends the element `l[i]` to the list `ans2`. This means that `ans2` now includes the new element `l[i]` added to its previous contents. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, `q`, and `l` remain the same; `k` is either -2 or a negative even number minus 4; `ans1` includes the element `l[i]`; `ans2` includes the new element `l[i]` appended to its previous contents; `i` is `i + 1`.**
