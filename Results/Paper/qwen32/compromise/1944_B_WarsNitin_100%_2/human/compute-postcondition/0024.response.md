Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `k` is an integer that is now 0; `a` is a list of integers; `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end; `ans1` is an empty list if `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`, otherwise it contains the last element of `b` twice; `ans2` is an empty list; `req` is equal to `k` which is 0; `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, and the last element of `b` (`b[n - 1]`) if `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`, otherwise `l` is an empty list**
