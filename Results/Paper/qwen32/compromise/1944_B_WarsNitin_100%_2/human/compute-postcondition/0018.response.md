Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end; `ans1` is an empty list; `ans2` is an empty list; `k` is now twice its original value; `req` is equal to `k`; `l` is an empty list because `b[n - 2]` is equal to `b[n - 1]`.**
