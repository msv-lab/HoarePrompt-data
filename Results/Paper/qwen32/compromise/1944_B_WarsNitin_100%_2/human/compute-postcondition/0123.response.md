Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` contains the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` contains the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end sorted in ascending order, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing the `n-1`th element of `b` twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` equals `k`, `q` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables do not change except for `q`, which is incremented by 1. We also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
