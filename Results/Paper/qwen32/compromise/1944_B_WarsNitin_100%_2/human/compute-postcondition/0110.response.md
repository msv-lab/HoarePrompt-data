The code snippet provided resets the `ans2` list to an empty list. This means that any previous contents of `ans2` are discarded.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `ans2`, which is set to an empty list. All other variables retain their previous values and states.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` contains the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` contains the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end sorted in ascending order, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` equals `max(0, k - len(l))`, `l` remains the same, `q` is incremented by 1.**
