Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end; `ans1` is an empty list.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `ans1` has been initialized as an empty list. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `c`) retain their initial values and properties.
