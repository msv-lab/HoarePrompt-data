To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(len(l)):`. Therefore, the only variable we can adjust is `l`.

For the loop to execute, `l` must have at least one element because `range(len(l))` will generate a sequence of indices from 0 to `len(l) - 1`. If `l` is empty, `range(len(l))` will be `range(0)`, and the loop will not execute.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` is 0 if enough consecutive duplicates were found, otherwise it retains its remaining value, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` remains the same, `ans2` contains all pairs of consecutive duplicates from `c` up to the point where `k` becomes 0 or the loop completes, `req` equals the final value of `k`, `l` must have at least one element**
