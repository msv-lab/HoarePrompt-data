The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The values of `n`, `k`, and the list `a` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50,000, and k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. a is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 50,000.**
