Postcondition: **`t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is either 0 or retains its original value, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicates of consecutive elements from `b` up to the point where `k` becomes 0 or the loop completes, `ans2` remains empty, `req` equals the final value of `k`, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not part of a consecutive duplicate sequence and are not the first or last element if they are repeated, `i` is 1. Additionally, `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`. If `k` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
