The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. For each test case, it outputs two lists: `ans1` and `ans2`. These lists together contain `k` pairs of identical numbers from the input list `a`, with `ans1` and `ans2` each containing up to `k` numbers, ensuring that each number in the output appears exactly twice across both lists.
