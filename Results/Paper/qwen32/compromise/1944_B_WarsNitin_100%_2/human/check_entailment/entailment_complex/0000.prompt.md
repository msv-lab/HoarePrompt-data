Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 1
    
    1 2 2 1
    
    6 1
    
    6 4 2 1 2 3 1 6 3 5 5 4
    
    4 1
    
    1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
    
    6 2
    
    5 1 3 3 5 1 2 6 4 6 4 2

Output

    2 1
    2 1
    6 4
    1 3
    1 2
    1 2
    5 1 3 3
    6 4 2 4
    
Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50,000, and k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. a is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 50,000.

    #State: `t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` is 0, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains pairs of consecutive equal elements from `b` and the first `|k|/2` elements of `l`, `ans2` contains pairs of consecutive equal elements from `c` and the first `|k|/2` elements of `l`, `req` remains the same, `l` remains the same.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. For each test case, it outputs two lists: `ans1` and `ans2`. These lists together contain `k` pairs of identical numbers from the input list `a`, with `ans1` and `ans2` each containing up to `k` numbers, ensuring that each number in the output appears exactly twice across both lists.
