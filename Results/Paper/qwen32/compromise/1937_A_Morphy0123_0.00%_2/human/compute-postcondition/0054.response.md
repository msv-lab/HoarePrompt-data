To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
2. `n` is unchanged (its value is not specified but it remains constant).
3. `i` is `i + 1` (indicating that `i` has been incremented by 1, but its exact value is not provided).
4. `power` is calculated as `ceil(log2(n)) - 1` and it is explicitly stated that `power` is not equal to `n`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(2 ** power)
```

### Analysis:
- `power` is calculated as `ceil(log2(n)) - 1`. This means that `power` is the largest integer less than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of `n`, minus 1.
- Since `power` is not equal to `n`, it implies that `n` is not a power of 2 minus 1 (i.e., `n` is not equal to `2 ** (power + 1) - 1`).

### Calculation of `2 ** power`:
- `2 ** power` will be the result of raising 2 to the power of `power`.
- Since `power` is `ceil(log2(n)) - 1`, `2 ** power` will be the largest power of 2 that is less than `n`.

### Final Output:
Given the information, the print statement will output `2` raised to the power of `power`, which is the largest power of 2 less than `n`.

Output: **2 ** power (where power is ceil(log2(n)) - 1)**
