The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n_cases`. If `i` is less than `n_cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 more than its previous value. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 again.

The states of `n_cases`, `n`, and `power` are not part of the loop head, so they should remain unchanged.

State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 1 more than its previous value**.

To be more specific, if `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it should now be 2 at the start of the next iteration, and so on.

State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an input integer, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since `i` is 1 more than its previous value at the end of the last iteration, we can express the state at the start of the next iteration as:

State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an input integer, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1**. 

Given that `i` was incremented at the end of the last iteration, the start of the next iteration will have:

State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an input integer, `i` is the next integer value**. 

If we assume the previous value of `i` was `k`, then the new value of `i` should be `k + 1`.

State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an input integer, `i` is incremented by 1**. 

To be precise, if `i` was `k` at the end of the last iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `k + 1`**.

Since we do not have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can generalize it as:

State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an input integer, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Thus, the final answer is:

State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `i + 1`**.
