Postcondition: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is the input integer, `power` is `floor(log2(n)) + 1`. If `power` is equal to `n`, then the current value of `power` remains equal to `n`. Otherwise, `power` is `floor(log2(n))`.**

This postcondition captures the state of the variables after the if-else block, considering both the condition where `power` equals `n` and where it does not.
