The given code snippet sets `power` to 1. This change affects the value of `power` directly. The values of `n_cases`, `n`, and `i` are not altered by this specific line of code. Therefore, the Output State is as follows:

Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an input integer, If `n` is equal to 1, then no additional changes are made to `n` or `n_cases`. Otherwise, `power` is set to `floor(log2(n)) + 1`. If `power` is equal to `n`, then `power` remains equal to `n`; otherwise, `power` remains `floor(log2(n))`. `i` is 1 more than its previous value. `power` is 1.**
