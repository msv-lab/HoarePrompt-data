The code snippet provided is simply reading an integer value from the input and assigning it to the variable `n`. It does not affect any other variables in the initial state description. Therefore, the only change is that `n` now holds the value of the input integer.

Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an input integer, If `n` is equal to 1, then no additional changes are made to `n` or `n_cases`. Otherwise, `power` is set to `floor(log2(n)) + 1`. If `power` is equal to `n`, then `power` remains equal to `n`; otherwise, `power` remains `floor(log2(n))`. `i` is 1 more than its previous value.**
