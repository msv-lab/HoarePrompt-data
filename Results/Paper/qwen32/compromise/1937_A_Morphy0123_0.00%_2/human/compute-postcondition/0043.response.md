To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition `power < log2(n)`. 

Given:
- `n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases (not relevant to the loop condition).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `i` is `i + 1` (not relevant to the loop condition).
- `power` is 1.

The loop will execute if `power < log2(n)`. Since `power` is initialized to 1, we need to make sure that `log2(n) > 1` for the loop to execute.

The logarithm base 2 of `n` (`log2(n)`) is greater than 1 if and only if `n > 2`.

Thus, to ensure that the loop can execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is `i + 1`, `power` is 1**
