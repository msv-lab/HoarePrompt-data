The provided code snippet initializes the variable `nx` as an empty string. No other variables are affected or modified by this line of code. Therefore, the state of `nx` changes, but the other variables (`xx`, `n`, `sa`, `i`, and `j`) remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`nx` is an empty string; `xx` is a string of length `n` where each character is determined by the corresponding character in `xx[n]`. If `xx[n][j - 1]` is not '?', it is appended to `nx`. If `xx[n][j - 1]` is '?', 'F' is appended if `n` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`; otherwise, 'S' is appended, `i` is `i + 1`**.
