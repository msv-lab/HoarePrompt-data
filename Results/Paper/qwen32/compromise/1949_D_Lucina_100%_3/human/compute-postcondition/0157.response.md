The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `xx[i][j - 1]`, `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, and `j`) are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state where `nx` is an empty string, after executing `nx += 'S'`, `nx` will be 'S'. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is 'S', `n` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?'. Additionally, `i` is not in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` and `j` is not in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`.**
