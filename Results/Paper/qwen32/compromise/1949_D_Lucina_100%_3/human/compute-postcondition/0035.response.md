Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where `a[1]` is the total number of 'F' characters in `x` and `a[j]` is the cumulative number of 'F' characters up to position `j` in `x`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where `b[1]` is the total number of 'S' characters in `x` and `b[j]` is the cumulative number of 'S' characters up to position `j` in `x`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and the input string `x`, `i` is 2, and `x` is the new input string. Additionally, the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'F'.**
