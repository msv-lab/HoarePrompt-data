The code snippet `b[j] += 1` increments the value of `b[j]` by 1. Given the initial state, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with `b[1]` incremented by 1 initially. The variable `j` is not explicitly defined in the provided initial state, but based on the context, `j` can be inferred to be 1 since `b[1]` is specifically mentioned.

Let's update the value of `b[1]` as per the code execution:

- `b[1]` was incremented by 1 initially.
- The code snippet `b[j] += 1` will further increment `b[1]` by 1.

Therefore, `b[1]` will be incremented by 2 in total.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24; `a` is a list of length `n + 1`; `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with `b[1]` incremented by 2; `xx` is a list containing a single empty string; `i` is 1; `x` is the input string; If the character at position `j - 1` in `x` was 'F', then `a[1]` is 2 and `b[1]` is 2; If the character at position `j - 1` in `x` was 'S', then `b[1]` is 4 and `a[1]` is 0; If the character at position `j - 1` in `x` was neither 'F' nor 'S', then all elements of `a` and `b` are 0 except `b[1]` which is 2, and `j` is 2.**
