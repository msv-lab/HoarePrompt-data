Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all `n` input strings, `i` is 2, `sa` is a list of indices where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and if `a[2] == 0 and b[2] == 0`, then `i` (which is 2) is appended to `sa`, making the length of `sa` `t + 1`. `sb` is a list of indices where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. The length of `sa` is still greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.**
