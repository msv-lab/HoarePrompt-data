The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character at index `j - 1` of the string `xx[i]` to the string `nx`. 

Given the initial state, `nx` is a string, `xx` is a string of length `n`, and `j` is 1. This means `xx[i][j - 1]` simplifies to `xx[i][0]`, the first character of the string `xx[i]`.

After the execution of the code, `nx` will be the original `nx` concatenated with the first character of the string `xx[i]`.

Output State: **`nx` is the original `nx` concatenated with `xx[i][0]`, `xx` is a string of length `n` where each character is determined by the corresponding character in `xx[n]`, `sa` is a list, `i` is an integer, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1.**
