Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all `n` input strings, `i` is `n+1`, `sa` is a list of indices where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` is a list of indices where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. If the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, a sequence of `n + 1` strings, where each string `nx` is of length `n`, is constructed by iterating through each character position `j` from `1` to `n` in the string `xx[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n + 1`. Each character in `nx` is determined by the rules: if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `'?'`, then `nx[j - 1]` is `xx[i][j - 1]`; if `xx[i][j - 1]` is `'?'`, then `nx[j - 1]` is `'F'` if either `i` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`; otherwise, it is `'S'`. Otherwise, after all iterations, `nx` will be a string constructed for each `xx[i]` from `i = 1` to `i = n`. For each `xx[i]`, `nx` will be formed by iterating over each character in `xx[i]` and replacing '?' characters with 'S' or 'F' based on the conditions involving `sb`. The variable `i` will be `n + 1` after the loop completes, and `j` will be `n + 1` at the end of the last iteration. The lists `a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, and `sb` will remain unchanged as per the precondition.**
