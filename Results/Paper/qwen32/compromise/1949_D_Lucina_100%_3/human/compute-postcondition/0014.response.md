Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with `b[1]` equal to 2 if the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'S', otherwise all elements of `b` are initialized to 0, `xx` is a list containing a single empty string, `i` is 1, and `x` is the input string.**
