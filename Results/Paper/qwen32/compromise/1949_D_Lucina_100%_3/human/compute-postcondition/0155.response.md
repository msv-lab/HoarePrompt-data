Output State: **`nx` is 'F', `n` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?'. Additionally, either `i` or `j` is in the list `sa` up to the index `n // 4 - 1`.**

Natural language: The string `nx` has been updated to 'F'. The values of `n`, `i`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` remain unchanged. The condition that either `i` or `j` is in the list `sa` up to the index `n // 4 - 1` is still valid.
