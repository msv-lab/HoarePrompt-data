Postcondition: **`x` is a string or a list, and `j` is an index such that `j - 1` is a valid index in `x`. If the element at index `j - 1` in `x` is 'F', then `a[i]` and `a[j]` are each incremented by 1. If the element at index `j - 1` in `x` is 'S', then `b[j]` is incremented by 1. If the element at index `j - 1` in `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', then `b[j]` remains unchanged.**
