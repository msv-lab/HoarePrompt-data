To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `nx` is a string of length `n`.
- Each character in `nx` is determined by the corresponding character in `xx[n]`.
- If `xx[n][j - 1]` is not '?', it is appended to `nx`.
- If `xx[n][j - 1]` is '?', 'F' is appended if `n` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`; otherwise, 'S' is appended.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(nx)
```

### Analysis:
To determine the exact output, we need to understand the construction of `nx` based on the rules provided:

1. **Loop through each character in `xx[n]`**:
   - For each character `xx[n][j - 1]`:
     - If the character is not '?', append it to `nx`.
     - If the character is '?', check the conditions:
       - If `n` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, append 'F'.
       - Otherwise, append 'S'.

2. **Construct `nx`**:
   - `nx` is built character by character based on the above rules.

### Output Description:
Since the exact values of `xx[n]`, `n`, `sa`, and `j` are not provided, we can only describe the construction of `nx` in terms of the given conditions.

- `nx` will be a string of length `n`.
- Each character in `nx` is either:
  - The corresponding character from `xx[n]` if it is not '?'.
  - 'F' if the corresponding character in `xx[n]` is '?' and either `n` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`.
  - 'S' if the corresponding character in `xx[n]` is '?' and neither `n` nor `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`.

### Final Output:
Output: **nx (where each character in nx is determined by the corresponding character in xx[n] following the rules provided)**
