Postcondition: **`nx` is a string, `xx` is a string of length `n` where each character is determined by the corresponding character in `xx[n]`, `sa` is a list, `i` is an integer, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 1. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', then `nx` is the original `nx` concatenated with `xx[i][0]`. Otherwise, if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, 'F' is appended to `nx`; otherwise, 'S' is appended to `nx`.**
