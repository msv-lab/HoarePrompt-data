The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the end of the string `nx`. This changes the value of `nx` while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is a string with 'F' appended to it, `xx` is a string of length `n` where each character is determined by the corresponding character in `xx[n]`, `sa` is a list, `i` is an integer, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 2.**
