### Reasoning:
Let's break down the logic of the given program to determine its correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating Space Requirements:**
   - `space_x` is calculated as `x * 1` which is simply `x` (the total number of 1x1 icon cells needed).
   - `space_y` is calculated as `y * 4` (the total number of 2x2 icon cells needed, which is 4 times the number of 2x2 icons).

3. **Calculating Screens Required for 2x2 Icons:**
   - `screen_require_for_y` is calculated to determine the minimum number of screens required to accommodate the 2x2 icons.
     - If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2` because each screen can fit 2 non-overlapping 2x2 icons.
     - If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1` because one additional screen is needed for the remaining 2x2 icon.

4. **Calculating Remaining Cells:**
   - `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. This represents the number of remaining cells on the screens after placing all the 2x2 icons.
     - Each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns).

5. **Calculating Screens Required for 1x1 Icons:**
   - If `space_x` (the number of 1x1 icons) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, no additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons, and `screen_require_for_y` is the answer.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates `extra_space` as `space_x - remaining_cells` (the number of 1x1 icons that still need to be placed).
     - If `extra_space` is divisible by 15, `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15` (the number of additional screens needed).
     - If `extra_space` is not divisible by 15, `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15 + 1` (one additional screen is needed for the remaining 1x1 icons).
   - The total number of screens required is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of screens required for each test case.

### Checking Correctness:
The logic seems correct based on the provided problem statement and the annotated comments. The program correctly handles the placement of 2x2 icons first and then calculates the remaining space for 1x1 icons. It also correctly handles cases where additional screens are required for the 1x1 icons.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
