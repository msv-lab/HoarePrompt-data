Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to decode an integer back into the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word based on the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet. The letters are indexed from 1 to 26, where 'a' is 1 and 'z' is 26.

### Program Analysis
The program uses the following logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.
3. It then determines the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that could have been encoded as `n` using a series of `if-elif-else` statements.

Let's break down the logic for different ranges of `n`:
- If `n > 52`: The word is constructed as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`. This means the first letter is `n - 53` positions from 'a', and the last two letters are 'z'.
- If `n > 27`: The word is constructed as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. This means the first letter is 'a', the second letter is `n - 28` positions from 'a', and the last letter is 'z'.
- If `n == 27`: The word is `'aay'`.
- If `n <= 27`: The word is constructed as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`. This means the first two letters are 'a', and the last letter is `n - 3` positions from 'a'.

### Verification Against Test Cases
Let's verify the program against the provided test cases:
1. **Input:** `24`
   - `n = 24`
   - Since `24 <= 27`, the word is `'aa' + alphabet[24 - 3]` = `'aa' + 'r'` = `'aar'`. However, the correct output should be `'aav'` because `'aav'` is lexicographically smaller than `'aar'`.
   - **Error** in the program.

2. **Input:** `70`
   - `n = 70`
   - Since `70 > 52`, the word is `alphabet[70 - 53] + 'zz'` = `alphabet[17] + 'zz'` = `'rzz'`.
   - This is correct.

3. **Input:** `3`
   - `n = 3`
   - Since `3 <= 27`, the word is `'aa' + alphabet[3 - 3]` = `'aa' + 'a'` = `'aaa'`.
   - This is correct.

4. **Input:** `55`
   - `n = 55`
   - Since `55 > 52`, the word is `alphabet[55 - 53] + 'zz'` = `alphabet[2] + 'zz'` = `'bzz'`. However, the correct output should be `'czz'` because `'czz'` is lexicographically smaller than `'bzz'`.
   - **Error** in the program.

5. **Input:** `48`
   - `n = 48`
   - Since `48 > 52` is false and `48 > 27` is true, the word is `'a' + alphabet[48 - 28] + 'z'` = `'a' + alphabet[20] + 'z'` = `'atzz'`. However, the correct output should be `'auz'` because `'auz'` is lexicographically smaller than `'atzz'`.
   - **Error** in the program.

### Conclusion
The program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it does not always produce the lexicographically smallest word for certain values of `n`.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**
