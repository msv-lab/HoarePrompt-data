To determine the final state of the array `a` after the loop has executed all iterations, let's analyze the loop:

The loop iterates over each element of the array `a` using the index `i` from `0` to `n-1`. During each iteration, the value at index `i` is increased by `i + 1`.

Here's the breakdown of the changes to the array `a`:
- After the first iteration (`i = 0`), `a[0]` is increased by `0 + 1 = 1`.
- After the second iteration (`i = 1`), `a[1]` is increased by `1 + 1 = 2`.
- After the third iteration (`i = 2`), `a[2]` is increased by `2 + 1 = 3`.
- This pattern continues until the last iteration (`i = n-1`), where `a[n-1]` is increased by `(n-1) + 1 = n`.

Thus, after the loop completes all `n` iterations, the `i`-th element of the array `a` will be increased by `i + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is increased by `i + 1` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.**

In simpler terms, each element in the array `a` is incremented by its 1-based index position.
