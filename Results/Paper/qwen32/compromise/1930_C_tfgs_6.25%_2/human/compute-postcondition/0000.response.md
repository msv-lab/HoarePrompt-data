The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state mentions that `n` is an integer representing the length of array `a`. After executing this code, `n` will hold the value of the input integer, and the array `a` and its elements remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer representing the length of array `a`, `a` is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9)**.
