### Reasoning:

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issue:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to construct the lexicographically largest array `b` by performing the described operations on the array `a` and then sorting the set `S` in decreasing order.

2. **Operations**:
   - For each element `a_i` in `a`, we need to add `i + 1` to it and insert the result into the set `S`.
   - Since `S` is a set, duplicate values will be ignored.
   - Finally, we need to sort the elements of `S` in decreasing order to form `b`.

3. **Current Implementation**:
   - The code correctly modifies each element of `a` by adding `i + 1` to it.
   - However, the subsequent steps to form `b` are incorrect. The code sorts the unique elements of the modified `a` and then tries to fill in gaps by appending decreasing values, which is not aligned with the problem requirements.
   - The core issue is that the code does not accurately reflect the set operations and the final sorting requirement.

### Correct Implementation:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Modify each element of `a` by adding `i + 1`.
- Insert these modified elements into a set `S` to ensure uniqueness.
- Convert the set `S` to a list and sort it in decreasing order.
- Print the resulting list.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the current implementation does not meet the problem requirements.

**Correctness: False**

Here is the corrected code for reference:

```python
from collections import Counter

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    S = set()
    
    for i in range(n):
        S.add(a[i] + i + 1)
    
    b = sorted(S, reverse=True)
    print(*b)
```

This corrected code correctly implements the described operations and produces the lexicographically largest `b`.
