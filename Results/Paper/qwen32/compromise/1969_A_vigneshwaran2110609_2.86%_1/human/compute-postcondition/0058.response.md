Output State: **`i` is `i + 3`, `n` is unchanged, `x` is unchanged, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `flag` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the value of `i` remains `i + 3`, the values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged, `l` still holds the list of integers obtained from the input, and `flag` remains `True`. The only change is that the program execution will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
