The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `x` must be greater than 0. 

Given that `i` is incremented by 1, we need to adjust `i` to be the incremented value. Since `x` must be greater than 0 and determines the upper limit of the loop, it remains unchanged unless specified otherwise.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration of the loop:
- `i` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `x` remains the same as it is the upper limit of the loop.

State: **`x` must be greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**
