The code snippet provided reads a line of input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the line into a list of strings based on whitespace, and then converts each of those strings into an integer, creating a list `l` of these integers.

Given the initial state, the value of `l` is not specified, but it will be determined by the input. The other variables `t`, `n`, `p`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i` for all `i` in [1, `n`], and all `p_i` are distinct; `x` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
