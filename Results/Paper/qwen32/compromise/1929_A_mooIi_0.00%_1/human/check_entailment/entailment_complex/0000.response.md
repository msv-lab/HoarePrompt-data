Reasoning:  
The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The task requires calculating the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n, after potentially rearranging the elements of the array. The maximum beauty can be achieved by arranging the array in either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing order.

The provided code, however, simply sorts each array in ascending order, converts the elements to strings, joins them with spaces, and prints the result. This is not the correct approach to solve the problem. The correct approach would be to sort the array in ascending or descending order (either works because the absolute difference is taken), then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

Since the code does not perform the necessary calculations to determine the maximum beauty, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
