Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The task is to find the maximum beauty of the array, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array to maximize this sum. The given program sorts the array and prints it, which does not compute the beauty of the array. To solve the problem, the array should be rearranged in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, which typically means arranging the elements in either ascending or descending order. However, the program does not calculate the beauty value; it only sorts and prints the array.
