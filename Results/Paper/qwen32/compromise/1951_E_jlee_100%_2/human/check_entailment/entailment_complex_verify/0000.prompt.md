You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

    #State: The loop has completed all `t` iterations, and the variables `t`, `i`, `s`, `string`, `n`, `done`, `count`, and `count2` reflect the final state of the last test case processed. Specifically, `i` is equal to `t`, `done` is `False` if no non-palindromic splits were found in the last test case, and `count` and `count2` reflect the final state of the character checks for the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of lowercase Latin characters and determines if the string can be split into one or two non-empty substrings such that the concatenation of these substrings is not a palindrome. It prints 'YES' followed by the number of splits (1 or 2) and the resulting substrings if such a split is possible; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all edge cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to correctly identify and partition strings that require more than two parts to ensure that none of the parts are palindromes.

Let's consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
abacaba
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
3
aba c ab
```

The string "abacaba" is a palindrome, and it cannot be split into a single non-palindrome substring. However, it can be split into multiple non-palindrome substrings, such as "aba", "c", "aba". The provided program will incorrectly output "NO" for this case because it does not attempt to find more than two partitions.

Another example:
```
Input:
1
aaaa
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
2
aa aa
```

The string "aaaa" is a palindrome and cannot be split into a single non-palindrome substring. However, it can be split into two non-palindrome substrings, such as "aa" and "aa". The provided program will incorrectly output "NO" for this case because it does not attempt to find more than two partitions.

The program's logic is flawed because it only considers the possibility of splitting the string into one or two parts. It does not attempt to find a valid partitioning into more than two parts when necessary. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
