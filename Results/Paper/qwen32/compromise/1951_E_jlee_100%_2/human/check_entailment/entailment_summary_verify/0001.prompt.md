You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of lowercase Latin characters and determines if the string can be split into one or two non-empty substrings such that the concatenation of these substrings is not a palindrome. It prints 'YES' followed by the number of splits (1 or 2) and the resulting substrings if such a split is possible; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description:

### Problem Recap
The task is to partition a given string `s` into substrings such that none of the substrings are palindromes. If such a partition exists, we must output "YES", the number of parts `k`, and the parts themselves. If no such partition exists, we output "NO".

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Single Character Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies that if the string length is 1, it cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings, thus outputting "NO".

2. **First and Last Character Check**:
   - If the first and last characters of the string are different, the program correctly identifies that the entire string can be a non-palindromic substring, thus outputting "YES" with the entire string as one part.

3. **All Characters Same Check**:
   - If all characters in the string are the same, it cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings, thus outputting "NO".

4. **Almost All Characters Same Check**:
   - If all but one character in the string are the same, the program checks if the middle character (if the length is odd) is different from the rest. If it is, it outputs "NO" because the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. Otherwise, it outputs "YES" with the entire string as one part.

5. **General Case**:
   - The program then iterates through the string to find a point where the characters do not mirror each other. If such a point is found, it outputs "YES" with the entire string as one part.
   - If no such point is found, the program attempts to find the first character different from the first character and tries to partition the string around this point. The logic here is a bit convoluted and does not necessarily ensure the correctness of the partition.

### Issues in the Program

The logic for the general case is flawed. The program tries to find a suitable partition by checking for the first character different from the first character and then checking conditions around this character. However, it does not guarantee that the resulting substrings will not be palindromes. For example, consider the string "abba". The program might partition it into "ab" and "ba", but both "ab" and "ba" are not palindromes, which is correct in this case, but the program's logic is not robust enough to handle all cases correctly.

### Conclusion

While the program handles some edge cases correctly, its logic for the general case is not sufficient to ensure that the resulting substrings are always non-palindromic. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to be correct for all possible inputs.
