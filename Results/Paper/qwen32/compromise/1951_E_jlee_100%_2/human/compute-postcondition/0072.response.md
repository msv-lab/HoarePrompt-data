Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`, `string` is the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `done` is True, and `count2` is 0. The current value of `count` is greater than 0, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is greater than `count`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.
