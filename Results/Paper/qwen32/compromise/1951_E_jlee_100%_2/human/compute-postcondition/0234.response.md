To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the conditions described:

1. **Variable `done`**: It is set to `True` if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. Otherwise, it remains unchanged. However, the exact value of `done` is not relevant to the `print('YES')` statement directly.

2. **Variable `i`**: It remains equal to `t`. The value of `t` is not specified, but it is irrelevant for the `print('YES')` statement.

3. **Variable `string`**: This is the user's input and remains unchanged.

4. **Variable `s`**: This is a list of characters from `string` and remains unchanged.

5. **Variable `n`**: This is greater than 0 and represents the length of the list `s`.

6. **Variable `x`**: This is the first character of `string` and remains unchanged.

7. **Variable `count`**: If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to `j`. However, the exact value of `count` is not relevant for the `print('YES')` statement.

8. **Variable `count2`**: This remains unchanged and is not relevant for the `print('YES')` statement.

9. **Variable `j`**: This remains unchanged and is not relevant for the `print('YES')` statement.

The `print('YES')` statement is independent of the values of `done`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `count`, `count2`, and `j` based on the information provided. The statement simply prints "YES" without any conditions or dependencies on the variables' values.

Thus, the output of the `print('YES')` statement will be:

Output: **YES**
