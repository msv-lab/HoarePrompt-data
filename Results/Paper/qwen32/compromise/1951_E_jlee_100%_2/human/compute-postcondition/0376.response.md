The `continue` statement in Python skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Given the initial state and the `continue` statement, the value of `j` will not be updated in this iteration, and the loop will move to the next iteration without changing the values of `j`, `n`, `count`, or `done`.

Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is `j`, and if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged and the loop or if statement continues.**

In simpler terms, the values of `j`, `n`, `count`, and `done` remain the same, and the loop proceeds to the next iteration.
