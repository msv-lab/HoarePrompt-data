Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, and for each test case, `s` is a string of lowercase Latin characters with length 1 <= |`s`| <= 10^6. The sum of |`s`| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to be an integer input by the user, while the conditions and constraints for `s` remain unchanged.
