The task provides an initial state with several variables and conditions, but the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the specific values of these variables. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes various variables and their conditions, but the `print` statement is independent of these conditions.
2. The `print('YES')` statement will execute and print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `s`, `string`, `n`, `done`, `count2`, `count`, `s[j]`, and `x`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
