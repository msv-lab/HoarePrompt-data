Output State: **`done` is `True`, `count` is greater than 1, `count2` equals `count`, `i` is `t + 1`, `string` is the new user's input, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is the first character of the new `string`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
