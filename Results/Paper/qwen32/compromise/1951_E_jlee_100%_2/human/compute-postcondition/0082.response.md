The given print statement is `print(1)`. This statement directly prints the integer `1` to the console. None of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `s`, `string`, `n`, `count2`, `j`) are used in the print statement, so their values are irrelevant for determining the output.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
