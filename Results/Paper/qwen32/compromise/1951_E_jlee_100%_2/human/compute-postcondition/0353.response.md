Postcondition: **`done` is `True` if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains `False`. `count` is greater than 0, and if `count` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `count2` equals `count` if `count` is greater than 1, otherwise `count2` is 0. `i` is `t + 1`, `string` is the new user's input, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is greater than 0, and `x` is the first character of the new `string`. Additionally, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.**
