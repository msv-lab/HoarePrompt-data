To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `j` is `j + 2`: This indicates that `j` is incremented by 2 from its previous value.
   - `n` is greater than 0: This means `n` is a positive integer.
   - `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains unchanged.
   - If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to `j`.

2. **Analysis of the `print` Statement**:
   - The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
   - The value `'YES'` is a string literal and does not depend on any variable or condition in the initial state.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`, the value of `j`, `n`, `done`, `s[j]`, `s[n - 1 - j]`, `x`, and `count` do not affect the output of this statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
