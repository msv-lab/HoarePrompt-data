The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, since there is no loop present in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any effect here. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`, `string` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s`, and `done` is False. The count of the first character `x` in the list `s` is `n - 1`. If the length of `s` (`n`) is odd and the middle character of `s` (at index `(n - 1) // 2`) is not `x`, then the condition in the if part is met. Otherwise, either `n` is even, or if `n` is odd, the middle element `s[(n - 1) // 2]` is equal to `x`.**
