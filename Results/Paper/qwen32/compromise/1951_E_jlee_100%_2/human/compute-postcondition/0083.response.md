Given the initial state, we have the following variables and their descriptions:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`.
- `string` is the input string.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `count2` is either 0 or 1.
- `j` is initialized to 1.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(string)
```

The variable `string` is explicitly mentioned as the input string, meaning it holds the value of the string that is provided as input to the program. Since no further manipulation or modification of `string` is mentioned in the initial state, the `print` statement will output the exact value of the input string.

Output: **string (where string is the input string)**
