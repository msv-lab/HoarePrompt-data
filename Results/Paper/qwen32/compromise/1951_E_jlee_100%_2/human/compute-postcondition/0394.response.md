The code snippet `done = True` sets the variable `done` to `True`. This change affects the variable `done` directly, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `count` remains `j` if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is not less than 1, `count` remains unchanged. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True and the loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged. `done` is True.**
