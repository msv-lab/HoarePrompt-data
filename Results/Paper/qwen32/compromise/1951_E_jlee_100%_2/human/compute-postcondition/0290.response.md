Postcondition: **`done` is `True` if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, or if `s[j]` is equal to `x` and `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`. `i` remains equal to `t`. `string` remains the user's input. `s` remains a list of characters from `string`. `n` remains greater than 0. `x` remains the first character of `string`. `j` is incremented by 1. `count` is equal to `j` if `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`. `count2` is incremented by 1 if `s[j]` is equal to `x`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
