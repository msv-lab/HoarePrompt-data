Postcondition: **`done` remains `False` if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` is set to `True`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to `j`. `count2` remains 0, `i` remains equal to `t`, `string` remains the user's input, `s` remains a list of characters from `string`, and `n` remains greater than 0. `x` remains the first character of `string`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
