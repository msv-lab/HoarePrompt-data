The `continue` statement in the code does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, the state of all variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`done` is `True` if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`; otherwise, `done` remains unchanged. `i` remains equal to `t`, `string` remains the user's input, `s` remains a list of characters from `string`, and `n` remains greater than 0. `x` remains the first character of `string`. `count` is now equal to `j`. `count2` remains unchanged, and `j` remains unchanged. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
