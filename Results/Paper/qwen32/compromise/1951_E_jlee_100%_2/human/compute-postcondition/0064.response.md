The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only and move to the next iteration of the loop. Given the initial state, the `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply instructs the program to proceed to the next iteration of the loop without executing any further code in the current iteration.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that the loop will proceed to its next iteration.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`, `string` is the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains False, and `count2` is 0. The current value of `count` is equal to 1, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is equal to `count`.**
