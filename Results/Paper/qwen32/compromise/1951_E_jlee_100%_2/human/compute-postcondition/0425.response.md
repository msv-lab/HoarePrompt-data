To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. `j` is updated to `j + 2`.
2. `n` is greater than 0.
3. `done` is set to `True` if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged.
4. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to `j`.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The print statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`. The value of `'YES'` is not dependent on the variables `j`, `n`, `done`, `s`, `x`, or `count`. The print statement is a literal string output and does not involve any computation or condition checking that would alter its output based on the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
