Postcondition: **`done` is `True` if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`; otherwise, `done` remains unchanged. `i` remains equal to `t`, `string` remains the user's input, `s` remains a list of characters from `string`, and `n` remains greater than 0. `x` remains the first character of `string`. `count` remains unchanged. `count2` remains unchanged. `j` remains unchanged. If `count2` is greater than `count`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
