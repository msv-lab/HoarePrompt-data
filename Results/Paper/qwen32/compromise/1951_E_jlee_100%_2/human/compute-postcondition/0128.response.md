Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`, `string` is the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The values of the variables `t`, `i`, `s`, `string`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged. The variable `done` is True, and the loop or if statement is broken.
