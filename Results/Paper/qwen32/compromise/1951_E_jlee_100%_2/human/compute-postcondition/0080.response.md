The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`, `string` is the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `count2` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1**
