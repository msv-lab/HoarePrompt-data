Postcondition: **`count` is greater than 0, `done` remains `False` if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` is set to `True`. `count2` remains 0, `i` remains equal to `t`, `string` remains the user's input, `s` remains a list of characters from `string`, and `n` remains greater than 0. `x` remains the first character of `string`. `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and if `count` was less than 1 before this condition, `count` is set to `j`.**
