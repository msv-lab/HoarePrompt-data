To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the provided conditions.

### Initial State and Conditions
1. **`j`**: The variable `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
2. **`n`**: The variable `n` is greater than 0.
3. **`count`**: 
   - `count` remains `j` if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1.
   - `count` remains unchanged if `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is not less than 1.
4. **`done`**: 
   - `done` is set to `True` and the loop or if statement is broken if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`.
   - `done` remains unchanged otherwise.
5. **`string`**: This is not explicitly defined, but it seems to be a string `s` used in the conditions.

### Print Statement Analysis
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```
This statement prints two parts of the string `string`:
- `string[:j - 1]`: This is the substring from the start of `string` up to, but not including, the character at index `j - 1`.
- `string[j - 1:]`: This is the substring from the character at index `j - 1` to the end of `string`.

### Determining the Output
Given the conditions, we need to consider the value of `j` and how it slices the string `string`.

- **`j`**: Since `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `j - 1` refers to the previous value of `j`.
- **`string[:j - 1]`**: This will be the substring from the start of `string` up to, but not including, the character at the previous value of `j`.
- **`string[j - 1:]`**: This will be the substring from the character at the previous value of `j` to the end of `string`.

### Conclusion
The output of the `print` statement will be the string `string` split at the position `j - 1`.

Output: **string[:j - 1] string[j - 1:] (where string[:j - 1] is the substring from the start of string up to, but not including, the character at index j - 1, and string[j - 1:] is the substring from the character at index j - 1 to the end of string)**
