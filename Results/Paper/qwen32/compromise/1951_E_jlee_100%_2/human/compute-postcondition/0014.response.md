Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. **`t`**: An input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
2. **`i`**: Initialized to 0.
3. **`s`**: A list of characters from the string `string`.
4. **`string`**: The input string.
5. **`n`**: The length of `s` (which is the length of `string`).
6. **`done`**: Initialized to False.
7. **`x`**: The first character of `string`. It is also given that `x` (the first character) is not equal to `s[-1]` (the last character).

### Print Statement:
```
print(string)
```

### Analysis:
The print statement simply prints the value of the variable `string`. According to the initial state, `string` is the input string provided to the program. Since the value of `string` is directly given as an input and no modifications to `string` are mentioned, the print statement will output the exact input string.

### Output:
Output: **string (where string is the input string)**
