Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

- `t` is a non-negative integer. This means `t` can be any integer value from 0 to infinity.
- `player` is a dictionary. However, the specific contents of this dictionary are not specified.
- `blud` is a list of two integers. The exact values of these integers are not given.
- `out` is a list containing at least one player identifier `p`. This means `out` has at least one element, and `p` is one of the elements in `out`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `t` is a non-negative integer.
- `p` is a player identifier, which is an element in the list `out`.

Since the exact values of `t` and `p` are not specified, we can only describe them in terms of the information given.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **t, p, ELIMINATED (where t is a non-negative integer and p is a player identifier in the list `out`)**
