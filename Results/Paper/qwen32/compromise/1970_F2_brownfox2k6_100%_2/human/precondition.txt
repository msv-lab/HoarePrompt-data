N and M are odd integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99. P is an integer such that 1 ≤ P ≤ 10. The field is a 2D list of strings with dimensions N x M, where each string represents a cell and can be "..", "R0", ..., "R9", "B0", ..., "B9", "RG", "BG", ".Q", or ".B". There is at least one "RG" and one "BG" on the field, and exactly one ".Q". T is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000. Each action in the list of T actions is a string that consists of a pair of characters representing an entity followed by a space and a character or pair of characters representing a valid action ("U", "D", "L", "R", "C .Q", "C .B", "T").
