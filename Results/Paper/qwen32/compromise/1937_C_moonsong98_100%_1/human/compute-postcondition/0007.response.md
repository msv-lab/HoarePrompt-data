To determine the output state, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and the function `func_1`. However, the function `func_1` is not defined in the given code snippet, so we will make some reasonable assumptions based on the typical behavior of such loops and the comparison operation used.

The loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`. For each iteration, it calls `func_1` with arguments `0, max_index, 0, i` and checks if the result is `'<'`. If the result is `'<'`, it updates `max_index` to the current value of `i`.

Given that the exact behavior of `func_1` is unknown, let's assume that `func_1` returns `'<'` if `i` is less than `max_index` and some other value otherwise. This is a common pattern for comparison functions.

Let's break down the possible scenarios:

1. If `func_1` returns `'<'` for some `i`, then `max_index` will be updated to that `i`.
2. If `func_1` never returns `'<'`, `max_index` will remain `0` as it was initialized.

Since the exact behavior of `func_1` is not provided, we can't definitively say which `i` will make `func_1` return `'<'`. However, if we assume that `func_1` does not return `'<'` for any `i`, then `max_index` will remain `0`.

Thus, the output state after the loop executes all iterations, assuming `func_1` does not return `'<'` for any `i`, would be:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `n` is not equal to 2, `max_index` is 0.**
