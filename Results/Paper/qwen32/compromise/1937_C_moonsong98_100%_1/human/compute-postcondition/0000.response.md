The code provided is `n = int(input())`, which means the value of `n` will be updated to whatever integer is input by the user. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4. However, after the `input()` function is called and the value is converted to an integer, `n` will take on the new input value, which could be any integer, not necessarily within the original range unless the input provided is within that range.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer**.
