To determine the output state, we need to consider the given initial state and the provided code snippet. The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer with the current value of 2. The code snippet provided is a function call `func_2(0, 1)`. Since the function `func_2` is not defined in the provided initial state or code snippet, we can only infer that this function is called with the arguments 0 and 1. Without the definition of `func_2`, we cannot determine how this function affects the variables `n` or any other variables. Therefore, we can only state that `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 2**.
