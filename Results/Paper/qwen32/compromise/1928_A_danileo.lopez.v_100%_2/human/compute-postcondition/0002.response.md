Output State: **For each of the `t` test cases, the program will print either 'Yes' or 'No' based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variables `a` and `b` will be re-assigned for each iteration, but `t` will remain unchanged. The state of `t` and any other variables not involved in the loop body will remain the same as the initial state.**
