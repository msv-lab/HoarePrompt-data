Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code has a logical flaw in handling the cases where either `a` or `b` is even. Specifically, it does not correctly evaluate all scenarios where a rectangle can be formed from the two resulting rectangles after a cut.

Let's analyze the code logic:

1. **Check if either `a` or `b` is even:**
   - If `a` is even, it divides `a` into two equal parts and checks if the new dimensions `(a//2, b)` are different from `(a, b)`.
   - If `b` is even, it divides `b` into two equal parts and checks if the new dimensions `(a, b//2)` are different from `(a, b)`.

2. **If both `a` and `b` are odd:**
   - It directly prints "No" because it assumes no other rectangle can be formed, which is incorrect.

However, the code does not handle cases where the rectangle can be split into two smaller rectangles of different sizes and then rearranged to form a new rectangle. For example, consider the case `a = 6` and `b = 3`:

- The rectangle can be cut into two `3x3` rectangles.
- These two `3x3` rectangles cannot form a new rectangle, but the code should handle this correctly.
- However, the code does not handle cases where the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles of different sizes and then rearranged.

Another example is `a = 4` and `b = 3`:

- The rectangle can be cut into a `2x3` and a `2x3`.
- These can be rearranged to form a `3x4` rectangle, which is different from `4x3`.

The code should handle all such cases where the rectangle can be split into two smaller rectangles and then rearranged to form a new rectangle. The current code only checks for even dimensions and does not handle the general case where the dimensions can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.

### Test Case to Demonstrate the Issue:
Consider the input:
```
1
4 3
```
The expected output is:
```
Yes
```
But the code will output:
```
No
```
This is because the code does not handle the rearrangement of the two `2x3` rectangles to form a `3x4` rectangle.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.
