Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob starts with a rectangle of size a x b. He wants to cut it into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides. Then, he wants to form another rectangle from these two smaller rectangles. If the new rectangle is different from the original one (considering 90Â° rotations as the same rectangle), he succeeds.

### Key Observations:
1. If both `a` and `b` are odd, Bob cannot cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged into a different rectangle. This is because cutting an odd-sized side in half results in non-integer sides, and cutting an odd-sized rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides would result in two rectangles of the same dimensions as the original (rotated), which do not form a different rectangle.
2. If either `a` or `b` (or both) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged into a different rectangle. For example, if `a` is even, he can cut it into two rectangles of size `a/2 x b`, which can be rearranged into a rectangle of size `a x (b/2)`.

### Program Analysis:
The program checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If so, it checks if the resulting rectangles after the cut are different from the original rectangle (ignoring rotations). If they are different, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No". If both `a` and `b` are odd, it directly prints "No".

### Detailed Steps of the Program:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b`.
3. **Check Evenness**:
   - If `a` is even, it cuts the rectangle into two `a/2 x b` rectangles. If `a/2` is not equal to `b`, it prints "Yes".
   - If `b` is even, it cuts the rectangle into two `a x b/2` rectangles. If `b/2` is not equal to `a`, it prints "Yes".
   - If neither `a` nor `b` is even, it prints "No".

### Correctness Evaluation:
The program correctly identifies when Bob can form a different rectangle and when he cannot, based on the evenness of the dimensions. Specifically:
- It correctly handles the case where both `a` and `b` are odd by printing "No".
- It correctly handles the case where either `a` or `b` is even by checking if the resulting rectangles can form a different rectangle.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
