The function definition provided does not match the problem description. However, based on the problem description, the input variables can be described as follows: N and M are integers representing the dimensions of the field with 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both are odd. The field is represented by a list of N strings, each containing M pairs of characters separated by spaces, representing the entities on the field. T is an integer representing the number of steps in the game with 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000. The following T lines each describe an action performed by an entity on the field.
