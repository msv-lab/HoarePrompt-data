Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Ball Catching:**
   - The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` is a comparison, not an assignment. It should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to correctly assign the player catching the Quaffle.

2. **Incorrect Goal Scoring Logic:**
   - The code checks if `players[mo[0]] in goals['R']` and `players[mo[0]] in goals['B']` separately, which means it will print both `BLUE GOAL` and `RED GOAL` if a player is on a cell that is both a red and a blue goal (which is not possible according to the problem description). Additionally, the code does not handle the scenario where a player scores in their own goal, which should result in the other team getting a point.

3. **Incorrect Quaffle Reset Logic:**
   - After a goal is scored, the Quaffle should always be reset to the middle of the field, regardless of which team scored. The current code incorrectly sets the Quaffle to the player's position if the player's team scored in their own goal.

4. **Incorrect Elimination Handling:**
   - The code correctly prints the elimination event, but it does not handle the case where multiple players are eliminated at the same time in alphabetical order. It should iterate over all players and check for eliminations, not just the first one found.

Here is a corrected version of the problematic parts of the code:

```python
# Corrected part for catching the Quaffle
elif mo[1] == 'C':
    quidditch[1] = mo[0]  # Corrected from == to =

# Corrected part for goal scoring logic
elif mo[1] == 'T':
    quidditch[1] = ''
    if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
        if mo[0][0] == 'R':  # Player scored in their own goal
            pointsb += 1
            print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
        else:  # Player scored in the other team's goal
            pointsr += 1
            print(i, 'RED GOAL')
        quidditch[0] = middle  # Reset Quaffle to middle
    elif players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:
        if mo[0][0] == 'B':  # Player scored in their own goal
            pointsr += 1
            print(i, 'RED GOAL')
        else:  # Player scored in the other team's goal
            pointsb += 1
            print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
        quidditch[0] = middle  # Reset Quaffle to middle

# Corrected part for elimination handling
elif mo[1] in 'ULDR':
    players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
    if '.B' in players:
        eliminated_players = []
        for k, v in players.items():
            if k != '.B' and v == players['.B']:
                eliminated_players.append(k)
        for k in sorted(eliminated_players):
            print(i, k, 'ELIMINATED')
            if quidditch[1] == k:
                quidditch = [v, '']
            del players[k]
```

These corrections address the issues mentioned above, ensuring the program behaves as expected according to the problem description.
