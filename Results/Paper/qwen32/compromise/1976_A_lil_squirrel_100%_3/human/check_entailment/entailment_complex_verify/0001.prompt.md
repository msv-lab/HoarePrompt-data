You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and password is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password`.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password`, and `letters` is sorted.
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password`, `letters` is sorted, and `digits` is sorted.
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password`, `letters` is sorted, and `digits` is sorted.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` checks if a given password, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, meets specific criteria: all letters must be in alphabetical order, all digits must be in ascending order, and no letter should be immediately followed by a digit. If the password meets these criteria, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. No digit should come after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends).
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password string itself.

2. **Logic in `func_1` function:**
   - **Separating Letters and Digits:**
     - The program iterates over each character in the password.
     - If the character is a digit, it appends it to the `digits` list.
     - If the character is a letter, it appends it to the `letters` list.
   
   - **Checking Sorted Order:**
     - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns `'NO'`.
     - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns `'NO'`.
   
   - **Checking the Order of Letters and Digits:**
     - It iterates over the password string to ensure that no digit comes after a letter. If it finds such a case, it returns `'NO'`.
   
   - If all the above checks pass, it returns `'YES'`.

### Verification Against the Problem Requirements:
1. **Condition 1:**
   - The program assumes the input is valid, i.e., it only contains lowercase Latin letters and digits as per the problem description. Hence, this condition is implicitly satisfied.

2. **Condition 2:**
   - The program checks that no digit comes after a letter by iterating through the password and comparing consecutive characters.

3. **Condition 3:**
   - The program checks if the digits are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the `digits` list with its sorted version.

4. **Condition 4:**
   - The program checks if the letters are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the `letters` list with its sorted version.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements all the conditions outlined in the problem statement. It handles each test case appropriately based on the given criteria.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
