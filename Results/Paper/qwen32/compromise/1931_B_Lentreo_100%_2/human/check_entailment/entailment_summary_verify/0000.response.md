Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution in detail.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to determine if it's possible to redistribute water among `n` containers such that each container has the same amount of water. The operation allowed is to pour water from a container `i` to a container `j` where `i < j`.

### Key Observations:
1. **Sum Divisibility**: The total amount of water must be divisible by `n` for it to be possible to distribute the water equally.
2. **Operation Constraint**: Water can only be poured from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index.

### Solution Approach:
The function `func_1` follows this logic:
- It calculates the total amount of water.
- It checks if the total amount of water is divisible by `n`. If not, it returns 'NO'.
- It calculates the mean amount of water each container should have.
- It iterates through the containers and maintains a cumulative difference (`curr`) between the actual amount of water and the mean up to the current container.
- If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means there is not enough water in the previous containers to redistribute to the current container, so it returns 'NO'.
- If the loop completes without `curr` going negative, it returns 'YES'.

### Analysis of the Original Assessment:
The original assessment claims that the function is incorrect because it does not handle cases where water needs to be redistributed from higher-indexed containers to lower-indexed containers, which is not allowed by the problem constraints.

However, the function's logic is actually correct given the constraints:
- The function correctly checks if the total water can be evenly divided.
- It ensures that at any point, the cumulative water (considering the mean) should not be negative. This is a valid check because if `curr` is negative at any point, it means there is a deficit of water that cannot be resolved by pouring water from higher-indexed containers (which is not allowed).

### Test Case Analysis:
Let's consider the test cases mentioned in the original assessment:

1. **Test Case:**
   ```
   3
   1 2 3
   ```
   - Total water: 6, Mean: 2
   - Cumulative differences: 
     - After 1: `1 - 2 = -1` (This would be invalid, but the function would actually return 'NO' if it ever goes negative, which it does here)
     - After 2: `(-1) + (2 - 2) = -1` (Invalid, but it goes negative)
     - After 3: `(-1) + (3 - 2) = 0` (Valid, but it already went negative)
   - The function correctly returns 'NO' for this case.

2. **Test Case:**
   ```
   3
   3 2 1
   ```
   - Total water: 6, Mean: 2
   - Cumulative differences:
     - After 3: `3 - 2 = 1`
     - After 2: `1 + (2 - 2) = 1`
     - After 1: `1 + (1 - 2) = 0`
   - The function correctly returns 'YES' for this case, but the original assessment claims it should return 'NO'. This is incorrect because the function's logic ensures that at no point does it go negative, meaning the water can be redistributed correctly.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is incorrect. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine if the water can be redistributed under the given constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
