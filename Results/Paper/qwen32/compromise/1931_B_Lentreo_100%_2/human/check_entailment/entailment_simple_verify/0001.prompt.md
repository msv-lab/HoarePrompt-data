You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The problem requires us to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from any container i to any container j where i < j. The key insight is that for it to be possible to make all containers have the same amount of water, the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the mean amount of water should never be negative as we traverse the containers from left to right.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water in the containers `nums`.
3. It then calls `func_1(nums)` to determine if it's possible to equalize the water in all containers.
4. Inside `func_1(nums)`:
   - It calculates the total amount of water across all containers.
   - It checks if the total amount of water is divisible by `n` (though this check is redundant since the problem guarantees this).
   - It calculates the mean amount of water per container.
   - It initializes `curr` to 0, which will keep track of the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the mean.
   - It iterates through each container, updating `curr` by adding the difference between the current container's water and the mean.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to balance out the deficit in the current container, so it returns 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it returns 'YES'.

The logic is sound because if `curr` never becomes negative, it means that at any point in the traversal, the water in the containers to the left can be redistributed to meet the mean requirement for the containers seen so far, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for the entire list to be equalized.
