Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw. The function `func_1` checks if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by ensuring that the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the mean does not go negative. However, this approach is not sufficient to determine if the water can be evenly distributed.

Consider the following test case:

```
2
3
1 2 3
3
3 2 1
```

For the first test case, the program correctly returns "YES" because the water can be redistributed to make each container have 2 units of water.

However, for the second test case, the program incorrectly returns "YES". The correct answer should be "NO" because the operation can only pour water from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index. In this case, there is no way to move water from the second and third containers (indices 1 and 2) to the first container (index 0) to make all containers have the same amount of water.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, and the correctness is False.
