You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) indicating the number of containers, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed that the sum of a_i in each test case is divisible by n and does not exceed 2 · 10^9. The total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    if (total % n != 0) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `nums` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) indicating the number of containers, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed that the sum of a_i in each test case is divisible by n and does not exceed 2 · 10^9. The total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `n` is the number of test cases in `nums`. `total` is the sum of all integers within all inner lists of `nums`. Additionally, `total` is perfectly divisible by `n`.
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: `nums` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case. `total` is the sum of all integers within all inner lists of `nums`. `mean` is the integer value of `total` divided by `n`. `curr` is 0.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` evaluates a list of test cases, where each test case consists of a number of containers and their respective water amounts. It checks if it's possible to redistribute the water in each test case such that all containers have the same amount of water. If it is possible, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw. The function `func_1` checks if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by ensuring that the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the mean does not go negative. However, this approach is not sufficient to determine if the water can be evenly distributed.

Consider the following test case:

```
2
3
1 2 3
3
3 2 1
```

For the first test case, the program correctly returns "YES" because the water can be redistributed to make each container have 2 units of water.

However, for the second test case, the program incorrectly returns "YES". The correct answer should be "NO" because the operation can only pour water from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index. In this case, there is no way to move water from the second and third containers (indices 1 and 2) to the first container (index 0) to make all containers have the same amount of water.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, and the correctness is False.
