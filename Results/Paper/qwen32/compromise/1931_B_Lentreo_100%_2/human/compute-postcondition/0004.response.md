Postcondition: **`nums` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) indicating the number of containers, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed that the sum of a_i in each test case is divisible by n and does not exceed 2 · 10^9. The total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `n` is the number of test cases in `nums`. `total` is the sum of all integers within all inner lists of `nums`. Additionally, `total` is perfectly divisible by `n`.**
