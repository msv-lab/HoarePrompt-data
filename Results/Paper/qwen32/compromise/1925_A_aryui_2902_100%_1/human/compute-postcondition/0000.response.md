The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 676, and `n` and `k` are integers within the range 1 to 26 for each test case.

After executing the code snippet, the values of `n` and `k` will be updated to the values provided by the input. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 676; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input.**
