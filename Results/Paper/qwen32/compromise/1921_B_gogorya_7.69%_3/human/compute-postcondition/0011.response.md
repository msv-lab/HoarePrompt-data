The value of `hd` is decremented by 1. Since `hd` was initially `a1 - a2` and greater than 0, after the operation, `hd` becomes `a1 - a2 - 1`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `s1` is the string input; `s2` is an input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 1`; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`; `i` is 0**
