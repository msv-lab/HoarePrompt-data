The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration. However, in the provided code snippet, there is no loop, so the `continue` statement does not affect the flow or the values of any variables. Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `s1`, `s2`, `a1`, `a2`, `hd`, `res`) are altered by the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `s1` and `s2` are input strings; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 1`; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`**
