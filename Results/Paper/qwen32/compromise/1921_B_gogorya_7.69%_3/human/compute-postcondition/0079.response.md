Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `s1` and `s2` are the new input strings, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`, `hd` is `hd - 1`, and `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 1` if `s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0'`. Otherwise, `res` remains `abs(a1 - a2)`, `i` is `i + 1`**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply causes the loop to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, all variables retain their previous values.
