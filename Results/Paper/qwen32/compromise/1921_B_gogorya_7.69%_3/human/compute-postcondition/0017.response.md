The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `s1` is the string input; `s2` is an input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2` if `hd` is not greater than 0, otherwise `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 1`; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 1` if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', otherwise `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`; `i` is 1. If `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', then `res` is incremented by 1.**
