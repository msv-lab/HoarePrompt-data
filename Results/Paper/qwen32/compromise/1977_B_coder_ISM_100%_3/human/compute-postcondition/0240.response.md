Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 32 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `s` is a list of characters, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `length` is at least 2, `nalla` is 32, `i` is `i + 1`. If `s[i] == '-1'` and `s[i - 1] == '1'`, then `s[i-1]` is set to `'-1'` and other elements of `s` are set to `'0'`. Otherwise, the list `s` remains unchanged.**
