Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 32 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `s` is a list of 30 characters ('1' or '0') representing the binary representation of `x` from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB). If `flag` was initially 0 and `s[0]` was '1' and `s[1]` was '1', then `s[0]` is now '-1', `flag` is 1, `s[0]` is '-1', and `s[1]` is '1'. Otherwise, if `flag` was 1, then `s[0]` is now '0'. `flag` is either 1 (with `s[0]` set to '0') or 0 (and `flag` remains 0). `length` is 30, `nalla` is 32, and `i` is 0.**
