Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of strings, and `length` remains the same. If the element at index 3 of `s` is `'1'` and the element at index 4 of `s` is `'-1'`, then the element at index 3 of `s` is updated to `'-1'` and the element at index 4 of `s` is updated to `'0'`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `s`.**
