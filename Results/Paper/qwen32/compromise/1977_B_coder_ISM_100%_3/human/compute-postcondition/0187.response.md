Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 32 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `s` is a list of 30 characters ('1' or '0') representing the binary representation of `x` from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB). If `flag` is 0 and `s[0]` is '0', then `s[0]` remains '0'. Otherwise, `s[0]` could be either '0' or '1' depending on the initial value of `flag` and `s[0]`. `flag` is 0, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 32, and `i` is 0.**
