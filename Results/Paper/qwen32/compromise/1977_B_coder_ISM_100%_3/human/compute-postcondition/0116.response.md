Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing the 30-bit binary representation of `x` (with the first bit changed to '1' if `flag` was 1 and `s[i]` was '0'), `flag` is either 0 or 1, `length` is 30, `nalla` is incremented by 1, `i` is 0. If `flag` was 0 and `s[i]` was '1' and `s[i]` was equal to `s[i + 1]`, then `flag` is set to 1 and `s[i]` is set to '-1'. Otherwise, if `flag` was 1, `s[0]` is set to '0'. In all other cases, `flag` remains unchanged and `s[i]` remains unchanged.**
