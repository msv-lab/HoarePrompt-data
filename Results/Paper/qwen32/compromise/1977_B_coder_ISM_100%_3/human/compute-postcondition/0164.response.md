The given code snippet simply reassigns the variable `x` with a new input integer. This means the previous value of `x` is discarded, and `x` now holds the value of the new input.

Here's the updated state of the variables after the code execution:

- `t` remains an integer such that 32 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `x` is reassigned to a new input integer.
- `s` remains a list containing the 30-bit binary representation of the original `x` where the 30th element is '0'.
- `flag` remains not 0.
- `length` remains 31.
- `nalla` remains 32.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 32 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `s` is a list containing the 30-bit binary representation of the original `x` where the 30th element is '0', `flag` is not 0, `length` is 31, `nalla` is 32.**
