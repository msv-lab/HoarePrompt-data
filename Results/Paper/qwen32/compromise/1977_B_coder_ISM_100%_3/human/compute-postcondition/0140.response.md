Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing the 30-bit binary representation of `x` with modifications based on the loop's logic, `flag` is 0, `length` is 30, `nalla` is incremented by 1, and either `flag` is not 0 or `s[29]` is not '0'**
