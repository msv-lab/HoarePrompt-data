Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable does not affect the `print(length)` statement directly.
2. **`x`**: An input integer. This variable is used to generate the binary representation stored in `s`.
3. **`s`**: A list containing the 30-bit binary representation of `x` with the 30th element being '0'. This list undergoes modifications based on specific conditions during the iterations.
4. **`flag`**: Not 0. This flag does not affect the `print(length)` statement directly.
5. **`length`**: Set to 31. This value remains constant throughout the process and is not modified by any of the operations described.
6. **`nalla`**: Incremented by 1 for each iteration, but it reaches 31 after 30 iterations. This variable also does not affect the `print(length)` statement directly.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(length)
```

### Analysis:
- The `length` variable is explicitly set to 31 and does not change throughout the described operations.
- The `print(length)` statement simply outputs the value of `length`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `length` is explicitly set to 31 and remains unchanged, the output of the `print(length)` statement will be `31`.

### Final Output:
Output: **31**
