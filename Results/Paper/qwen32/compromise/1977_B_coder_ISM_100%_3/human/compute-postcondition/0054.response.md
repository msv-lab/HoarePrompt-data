Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each either `'1'` or `'0'`, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `length` is 30, `i` is 2. If `flag` was 1 and `s[2]` was `'0'`, then `flag` is now 0 and `s[2]` is now `'1'`. Otherwise, `flag` and `s` remain unchanged.**
