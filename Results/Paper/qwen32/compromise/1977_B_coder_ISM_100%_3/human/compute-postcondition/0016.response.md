The code snippet appends the string `'1'` to the list `s`. The values of `t`, `x`, `length`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is in the list `s`, which now includes an additional `'1'` at the end.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing either the string `'1'` or the string `'0'` depending on whether the `i`-th bit of `x` is set or not, with an additional `'1'` appended, `length` is 30, `i` is `i + 2`**.
