In the given task, the loop will iterate based on the value of `t`, which is already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). The loop variable `nalla` is initialized automatically by the `range(t)` function and does not need to be set manually before the loop starts.

To ensure the loop executes, the only requirement is that `t` should be at least 1, since `range(t)` will generate numbers from 0 up to (but not including) `t`. Given the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the loop will definitely execute at least once because `t` is guaranteed to be at least 1.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes. The variable `nalla` does not need to be set before the loop starts as it is controlled by the `range` function.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
